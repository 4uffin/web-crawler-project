[$] Typst: a possible LaTeX replacement
[Development] Posted Sep 17, 2025 14:30 UTC (Wed) by leephillips
Typst is a program for document
typesetting. It is especially well-suited to technical material
incorporating elements such as mathematics, tables, and floating
figures. It produces high-quality results, comparable to the gold standard,
LaTeX, with a simpler markup
system and easier customization, all while compiling documents
more quickly. Typst is free software, Apache-2.0 licensed, and is written in Rust.

[$] Providing support for Windows 10 refugees
[Distributions] Posted Sep 17, 2025 13:41 UTC (Wed) by jzb
In October, consumer versions of Windows 10 will
stop receiving security updates. Many users who would ordinarily move
to the next version are blocked by Windows 11's hardware
requirements unless they are willing to buy a newer PC. The "End of 10" campaign is an effort to
convince those users to switch to Linux rather than sticking with an
end-of-life operating system or buying a new Windows system. At
Akademy 2025, Dr. Joseph De Veaugh-Geiss,
Bettina Louis,
Carolina Silva Rodé, and Nicole Teale discussed their
work on the campaign, its progress so far, and what's next.

[$] Comparing Rust to Carbon
[Development] Posted Sep 16, 2025 16:10 UTC (Tue) by daroc
Safe, ergonomic interoperability between Rust and C/C++ was a popular topic at
RustConf 2025 in Seattle, Washington. Chandler Carruth gave a presentation
about the different approaches to interoperability in Rust and
Carbon, the
experimental "(C++)++" language.
His ultimate conclusion was that
while Rust's ability to interface with other languages is expanding over time,
it wouldn't offer a complete solution to C++ interoperability anytime soon — and so there is room for
Carbon to take a different approach to incrementally upgrading existing C++ projects.
His
slides are available for readers wishing to study his example code in more
detail.

[$] Fighting human trafficking with self-contained applications
[Development] Posted Sep 15, 2025 19:15 UTC (Mon) by daroc
Brooke Deuson is the developer behind
Trafficking Free Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization that
produces free software to help law enforcement combat human trafficking. She is
a survivor of human trafficking herself.
She spoke at RustConf 2025 about her
mission, and why she chose to write her anti-trafficking software in Rust.
Interestingly, it has nothing to do with Rust's lifetime-analysis-based memory-safety —
instead, her choice was motivated by the difficulty she faces getting police
departments to actually use her software. The fact that Rust is statically
linked and capable of cross compilation by default makes deploying Rust software
in those environments easier.

[$] New kernel tools: wprobes, KStackWatch, and KFuzzTest
[Kernel] Posted Sep 15, 2025 15:14 UTC (Mon) by corbet
The kernel runs in a special environment that makes it difficult to use
many of the development tools that are available to user-space developers.
Kernel developers often respond by simply doing without, but the truth is
that they need good tools as much as anybody else.
Three new tools for the
tracking down of bugs have recently landed on the linux-kernel mailing
list; here is an overview.

[$] Creating a healthy kernel subsystem community
[Kernel] Posted Sep 12, 2025 15:50 UTC (Fri) by jake
Creating welcoming communities within open-source projects is a recurring
topic at conferences; those projects rely on contributions from others, so
making them welcome is important. The kernel has, rather infamously
over the years, been an oft-cited example of an unwelcoming project, though
there have been (and are) multiple efforts to change that with varying
degrees of success.
Hans de Goede talked about such efforts within his
corner of the kernel project in a talk (YouTube video) at
Open
Source Summit Europe.

[$] A policy for Link tags
[Kernel] Posted Sep 11, 2025 15:16 UTC (Thu) by corbet
The Git source-code management system stores a lot of information about
changes to code — but it does not hold everything that might be of interest
to a developer who needs to investigate a specific change in the future.
Commits in a repository are the end result of a (sometimes extended)
discussion; often, that discussion will result in changes to the code that
are not explained in the changelog.
For some years now, many maintainers
have followed the convention of applying a Link tag to commits that points
back to the mailing-list posting of the change.
Linus Torvalds has been
expressing his dislike for this convention for a while, though, and its
time appears to be coming to an end.

How many ways are there to configure the Linux kernel?
[Kernel] Posted Sep 10, 2025 16:10 UTC (Wed) by daroc
There are a large number of ways to configure the 6.16
Linux kernel. It has 32,468 different configuration options on x86_64,
and a comparable number for other platforms. Exploring the ways the kernel can
be configured is sufficiently difficult that it requires specialized tools.
These show the
number of possible configurations that options can be combined in has
6,550 digits. How has that number changed over the history of the kernel, and
what does it mean for testing?

Jackson: tag2upload in the first month of forky
[Distributions] Posted Sep 17, 2025 15:41 UTC (Wed) by jzb
Ian Jackson has published a blog
post summarizing the tag2upload service's
first month of handling uploads for the upcoming Debian 14 ("forky") release:
We announced tag2upload's open beta in mid-July. That was in the
middle of the the freeze for trixie, so usage was fairly light until
the forky floodgates opened.
Since then the service has successfully performed 637 uploads, of
which 420 were in the last 32 days. That's an average of about 13 per
day. For comparison, during the first half of September up to today
there have been 2475 uploads to unstable. That's about 176/day.
So, tag2upload is already handling around 7.5% of uploads. This is
very gratifying for a service which is advertised as still being in
beta!
LWN covered
tag2upload in July 2024.

bindings by default, using Doxygen to generate API documentation, as
well as bringing HTML serialization and handling of character
encodings more in line with the HTML5 specification.
Nick Wellnhofer has also announced
that he is stepping down as libxml2 maintainer, and Iván Chavero has
volunteered
to take over. LWN covered libxml2 in
June.

changes; slice units now have basic workload management features,
quotas for tmpfs have been added, the "systemctl start"
command now has a verbose (-v) option, and more. This release
also, finally, completely removes support for control groups v1
support. LWN covered
some of systemd v258's features and changes in August.

Another npm supply-chain attack
[Security] Posted Sep 16, 2025 13:51 UTC (Tue) by corbet
The Socket.dev blog describes
this week's attack on JavaScript packages in the npm repository.
A malicious update to @ctrl/tinycolor (2.2M weekly
downloads) was detected on npm as part of a broader supply chain
attack that impacted more than 40 packages spanning multiple
maintainers.
The compromised versions include a function
(NpmModule.updatePackage) that downloads a package
tarball, modifies package.json, injects a local script
(bundle.js), repacks the archive, and republishes it,
enabling automatic trojanization of downstream packages.
There is some more information in this
Krebs on Security article.

December 11 to 13) is

LPC tickets often sell out quickly, so it would be best not
to delay if you intend to attend.

Varnish 8.0.0 and bonus project news
[Development] Posted Sep 15, 2025 17:51 UTC (Mon) by jzb
Version
8.0.0 of Varnish Cache
has been released. In addition to a number
of changes to varnishd parameters, the ability to access some
runtime parameters using the Varnish Configuration Language, and other
improvements, 8.0.0 comes with big news; the project is forming an
organization called a forening
that will set out formal governance for the project.
The move also comes with a name change due to legal difficulties in
securing the Varnish Cache name:
The new association and the new project will be named "The Vinyl
Cache Project", and this release 8.0.0, will be the last under the
"Varnish Cache" name. The next release, in March will be under the new
name, and will include compatility scripts, to make the transition as
smooth as possible for everybody.
I want to make it absolutely clear that this is 100% a mess of my
making: I should have insisted on a firm written agreement about the
name sharing, but I did not.
I will also state for the record, that there are no hard feelings
between Varnish Software and the FOSS project.
Varnish Software has always been, and still is, an important and
valued contributor to the FOSS project, but sometimes even friends can
make a mess of a situation.
