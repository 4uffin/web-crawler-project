[$] Extending the time-slice-extension discussion
[Kernel] Posted Sep 18, 2025 15:30 UTC (Thu) by corbet
Time-slice extension is a proposed scheduler feature that would allow a
user-space process to request to not be preempted for a short period while
it executes a critical section.
It is an idea that has been circulating
for years, but efforts to implement it became
more serious in February of this year.
The latest developer to make an
attempt at time-slice extension is Thomas Gleixner, who has posted a new patch set
with a reworked API.
Chances are good that this implementation is close to
what will actually be adopted by the kernel.

[$] Typst: a possible LaTeX replacement
[Development] Posted Sep 17, 2025 14:30 UTC (Wed) by leephillips
Typst is a program for document
typesetting. It is especially well-suited to technical material
incorporating elements such as mathematics, tables, and floating
figures. It produces high-quality results, comparable to the gold standard,
LaTeX, with a simpler markup
system and easier customization, all while compiling documents
more quickly. Typst is free software, Apache-2.0 licensed, and is written in Rust.

[$] Providing support for Windows 10 refugees
[Distributions] Posted Sep 17, 2025 13:41 UTC (Wed) by jzb
In October, consumer versions of Windows 10 will
stop receiving security updates. Many users who would ordinarily move
to the next version are blocked by Windows 11's hardware
requirements unless they are willing to buy a newer PC. The "End of 10" campaign is an effort to
convince those users to switch to Linux rather than sticking with an
end-of-life operating system or buying a new Windows system. At
Akademy 2025, Dr. Joseph De Veaugh-Geiss,
Bettina Louis,
Carolina Silva Rodé, and Nicole Teale discussed their
work on the campaign, its progress so far, and what's next.

[$] Comparing Rust to Carbon
[Development] Posted Sep 16, 2025 16:10 UTC (Tue) by daroc
Safe, ergonomic interoperability between Rust and C/C++ was a popular topic at
RustConf 2025 in Seattle, Washington. Chandler Carruth gave a presentation
about the different approaches to interoperability in Rust and
Carbon, the
experimental "(C++)++" language.
His ultimate conclusion was that
while Rust's ability to interface with other languages is expanding over time,
it wouldn't offer a complete solution to C++ interoperability anytime soon — and so there is room for
Carbon to take a different approach to incrementally upgrading existing C++ projects.
His
slides are available for readers wishing to study his example code in more
detail.

[$] Fighting human trafficking with self-contained applications
[Development] Posted Sep 15, 2025 19:15 UTC (Mon) by daroc
Brooke Deuson is the developer behind
Trafficking Free Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization that
produces free software to help law enforcement combat human trafficking. She is
a survivor of human trafficking herself.
She spoke at RustConf 2025 about her
mission, and why she chose to write her anti-trafficking software in Rust.
Interestingly, it has nothing to do with Rust's lifetime-analysis-based memory-safety —
instead, her choice was motivated by the difficulty she faces getting police
departments to actually use her software. The fact that Rust is statically
linked and capable of cross compilation by default makes deploying Rust software
in those environments easier.

[$] New kernel tools: wprobes, KStackWatch, and KFuzzTest
[Kernel] Posted Sep 15, 2025 15:14 UTC (Mon) by corbet
The kernel runs in a special environment that makes it difficult to use
many of the development tools that are available to user-space developers.
Kernel developers often respond by simply doing without, but the truth is
that they need good tools as much as anybody else.
Three new tools for the
tracking down of bugs have recently landed on the linux-kernel mailing
list; here is an overview.

[$] Creating a healthy kernel subsystem community
[Kernel] Posted Sep 12, 2025 15:50 UTC (Fri) by jake
Creating welcoming communities within open-source projects is a recurring
topic at conferences; those projects rely on contributions from others, so
making them welcome is important. The kernel has, rather infamously
over the years, been an oft-cited example of an unwelcoming project, though
there have been (and are) multiple efforts to change that with varying
degrees of success.
Hans de Goede talked about such efforts within his
corner of the kernel project in a talk (YouTube video) at
Open
Source Summit Europe.

[$] A policy for Link tags
[Kernel] Posted Sep 11, 2025 15:16 UTC (Thu) by corbet
The Git source-code management system stores a lot of information about
changes to code — but it does not hold everything that might be of interest
to a developer who needs to investigate a specific change in the future.
Commits in a repository are the end result of a (sometimes extended)
discussion; often, that discussion will result in changes to the code that
are not explained in the changelog.
For some years now, many maintainers
have followed the convention of applying a Link tag to commits that points
back to the mailing-list posting of the change.
Linus Torvalds has been
expressing his dislike for this convention for a while, though, and its
time appears to be coming to an end.

Bluefin LTS released
[Distributions] Posted Sep 18, 2025 14:24 UTC (Thu) by jzb
The Universal Blue project has announced the release of Bluefin LTS,
an image-based distribution similar to Bluefin that uses
CentOS Stream 10 and EPEL instead of Fedora as its base:
Bluefin LTS ships with Linux 6.12.0, which is the kernel for the
lifetime of release. An optional hwe branch with new kernels is
available, offering the same modern kernel you'll find in Bluefin and
Bluefin GTS. Both vanilla and HWE ISOs are available, and you can
always choose to switch back and forth after installation. [...]
Bluefin LTS provides a backported GNOME desktop so that you are not
left behind. This is an important thing for us. James has been
diligently working on GNOME backports with the upstream CentOS
community, and we feel bringing modern GNOME desktops to an LTS makes
sense.

Tails 7.0 released
[Distributions] Posted Sep 18, 2025 13:52 UTC (Thu) by jzb
Version
7.0 of the Tails portable
operating system has been released. This is the first version of Tails
based on Linux 6.12.43, Debian 13
("trixie") and GNOME 48. It uses ztsd instead of
xz to compress the USB and ISO images to deliver a
faster start time on most computers. The release is dedicated to the memory of Lunar, "a
traveling companion for Tails, a Tor volunteer, Free Software hacker,
and community organizer":
Lunar has always been by our side throughout Tails' history. From
the first baby steps of the project that eventually became Tails, to
the merge with Tor, he's provided sensible technical suggestions,
out-of-the-box product design ideas, outreach support, and caring
organizational advice.
Outside of Tor, Lunar worked on highly successful Free Software
projects such as the Debian project, the Linux distribution on which
Tails is based, and the Reproducible Builds
project, which helps us verify the integrity of Tails releases.
See the changelog
for a full list of fixes, upgraded applications, and removals. LWN covered Tails
Project team leader intrigeri's DebConf25 talk in July.

Jackson: tag2upload in the first month of forky
[Distributions] Posted Sep 17, 2025 15:41 UTC (Wed) by jzb
Ian Jackson has published a blog
post summarizing the tag2upload service's
first month of handling uploads for the upcoming Debian 14 ("forky") release:
We announced tag2upload's open beta in mid-July. That was in the
middle of the the freeze for trixie, so usage was fairly light until
the forky floodgates opened.
Since then the service has successfully performed 637 uploads, of
which 420 were in the last 32 days. That's an average of about 13 per
day. For comparison, during the first half of September up to today
there have been 2475 uploads to unstable. That's about 176/day.
So, tag2upload is already handling around 7.5% of uploads. This is
very gratifying for a service which is advertised as still being in
beta!
LWN covered
tag2upload in July 2024.

support. LWN covered
some of systemd v258's features and changes in August.
