[$] Creating a healthy kernel subsystem community
[Kernel] Posted Sep 12, 2025 15:50 UTC (Fri) by jake
Creating welcoming communities within open-source projects is a recurring
topic at conferences; those projects rely on contributions from others, so
making them welcome is important. The kernel has, rather infamously
over the years, been an oft-cited example of an unwelcoming project, though
there have been (and are) multiple efforts to change that with varying
degrees of success.
Hans de Goede talked about such efforts within his
corner of the kernel project in a talk (YouTube video) at
Open
Source Summit Europe.

[$] A policy for Link tags
[Kernel] Posted Sep 11, 2025 15:16 UTC (Thu) by corbet
The Git source-code management system stores a lot of information about
changes to code — but it does not hold everything that might be of interest
to a developer who needs to investigate a specific change in the future.
Commits in a repository are the end result of a (sometimes extended)
discussion; often, that discussion will result in changes to the code that
are not explained in the changelog.
For some years now, many maintainers
have followed the convention of applying a Link tag to commits that points
back to the mailing-list posting of the change.
Linus Torvalds has been
expressing his dislike for this convention for a while, though, and its
time appears to be coming to an end.

[$] How many ways are there to configure the Linux kernel?
[Kernel] Posted Sep 10, 2025 16:10 UTC (Wed) by daroc
There are a large number of ways to configure the 6.16
Linux kernel. It has 32,468 different configuration options on x86_64,
and a comparable number for other platforms. Exploring the ways the kernel can
be configured is sufficiently difficult that it requires specialized tools.
These show the
number of possible configurations that options can be combined in has
6,550 digits. How has that number changed over the history of the kernel, and
what does it mean for testing?

[$] KDE launches its own distribution (again)
[Distributions] Posted Sep 10, 2025 14:12 UTC (Wed) by jzb
At Akademy 2025, the
KDE Project released an
alpha version of KDE Linux, a
distribution built by the project to "include the best
implementation of everything KDE has to offer, using the most advanced
technologies". It is aimed at providing an operating system
suitable for home use, business use, OEM installations, and more
"eventually". For now there are many rough edges and missing
features that users should be aware of before taking the plunge; but
it is an interesting look at the kind of complete Linux system that
KDE developers would like to see.

[$] Introducing Space Grade Linux
[Distributions] Posted Sep 9, 2025 13:59 UTC (Tue) by jake
A new project, targeting Linux for the proverbial final frontier—outer
space—was the subject of a talk (YouTube video) at
the Embedded Linux Conference, which was held as part of Open
Source Summit Europe in Amsterdam in late August.
Ramón Roche
introduced Space Grade
Linux (SGL), which is currently incubating as a special interest group
(SIG) of the Embedding Linux in Safety
Applications (ELISA) project.
The idea is to create a distribution
with a base layer that can be used for off-planet missions of various
sorts, along with other layers that can be used to customize it for
different space-based use cases.

[$] Testing the 2-in-1 Framework 12 Laptop
[Front] Posted Sep 8, 2025 15:12 UTC (Mon) by jzb
Framework Computer is a US-based
computer manufacturer with a line of Linux-supported, modular, easily
repairable and upgradeable laptops. In February, the company announced
a new model, the Framework Laptop 12,
an "entry-level" 12.2-inch convertible notebook that can be
used as a laptop or tablet. The systems were made available for pre-order
in April, I received mine in mid-August. Since then, I have been
putting it through its paces with Debian 13 ("trixie") and
Fedora Linux 42. It's a good choice for users who want a
Linux-friendly, lightweight, 2-in-1
device—if they are willing to make a few concessions on storage
capacity, RAM, and CPU/GPU choices.

[$] Rug pulls, forks, and open-source feudalism
[Development] Posted Sep 5, 2025 14:48 UTC (Fri) by corbet
Like almost all human endeavors, open-source software development involves
a range of power dynamics.
Companies, developers, and users are all
concerned with the power to influence the direction of the software — and,
often, to profit from it.
At the 2025 Open
Source Summit Europe, Dawn Foster talked about how those dynamics can
play out, with an eye toward a couple of tactics — rug pulls and forks — that
are available to try to shift power in one direction or another.

[$] The dependency tracker for complex deadlock detection
[Kernel] Posted Sep 4, 2025 14:34 UTC (Thu) by corbet
Deadlocks are a constant threat in concurrent settings with shared
data; it is thus not surprising that the kernel project has long since
developed tools to detect potential deadlocks so they can be fixed before
they affect production users.
Byungchul Park thinks that he has developed
a better tool that can detect more deadlock-prone situations.
At the 2025 Open
Source Summit Europe, he presented an introduction to his dependency
tracker (or "DEPT") tool and the kinds of problems it can detect.

Kernel prepatch 6.17-rc6
[Kernel] Posted Sep 14, 2025 23:26 UTC (Sun) by corbet
The 6.17-rc6 kernel prepatch is out for
testing.
"But really, none of it is very large. So everything seems slated for a
normal release in two weeks.
Please do keep testing, so that we don't get complacent."

Six stable kernels patching the VMScape Spectre variant
[Kernel] Posted Sep 11, 2025 16:46 UTC (Thu) by jake
The VMScape
vulnerability is a Spectre variant that "allows a malicious KVM guest to
leak sensitive information such as encryption/decryption keys from a
userspace hypervisor such as QEMU".
Greg Kroah-Hartman has announced
the 6.16.7, 6.12.47, 6.6.106, 6.1.152, 5.15.193, and 5.10.244 stable kernels, which add a
mitigation for the hardware bug.

How FOSS Projects Handle Legal Takedown Requests (F-Droid)
[Briefs] Posted Sep 11, 2025 14:34 UTC (Thu) by corbet
The F-Droid project has some
advice for free-software projects on how to deal with takedown
requests.
As part of our legal resilience research, we spoke with a range of
legal experts, software freedom advocates, and maintainers of
mature FOSS infrastructure to understand how others manage these
moments. In this article, we share what we learned, and how F-Droid
is incorporating these lessons into its own approach.

A path toward removal of kernel high-memory support
[Kernel] Posted Sep 9, 2025 21:53 UTC (Tue) by corbet
As a followup to his OSS Europe talk on the
future of 32-bit support in the kernel, Arnd Bergmann has put together
a
detailed plan for the eventual removal of high-memory support, which he
calls "one of the least popular features of the Linux kernel".
The
intent is "to gradually phase out highmem over the next 2 years for
mainline kernels".
This plan is posted as a prompt for a discussion to
be held at the Kernel Summit in December, so chances are it will evolve
considerably in the next few months.
