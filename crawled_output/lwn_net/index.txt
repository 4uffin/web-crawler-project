[$] Fighting human trafficking with self-contained applications
[Development] Posted Sep 15, 2025 19:15 UTC (Mon) by daroc
Brooke Deuson is the developer behind
Trafficking Free Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization that
produces free software to help law enforcement combat human trafficking. She is
a survivor of human trafficking herself.
She spoke at RustConf 2025 about her
mission, and why she chose to write her anti-trafficking software in Rust.
Interestingly, it has nothing to do with Rust's lifetime-analysis-based memory-safety —
instead, her choice was motivated by the difficulty she faces getting police
departments to actually use her software. The fact that Rust is statically
linked and capable of cross compilation by default makes deploying Rust software
in those environments easier.

[$] New kernel tools: wprobes, KStackWatch, and KFuzzTest
[Kernel] Posted Sep 15, 2025 15:14 UTC (Mon) by corbet
The kernel runs in a special environment that makes it difficult to use
many of the development tools that are available to user-space developers.
Kernel developers often respond by simply doing without, but the truth is
that they need good tools as much as anybody else.
Three new tools for the
tracking down of bugs have recently landed on the linux-kernel mailing
list; here is an overview.

[$] Creating a healthy kernel subsystem community
[Kernel] Posted Sep 12, 2025 15:50 UTC (Fri) by jake
Creating welcoming communities within open-source projects is a recurring
topic at conferences; those projects rely on contributions from others, so
making them welcome is important. The kernel has, rather infamously
over the years, been an oft-cited example of an unwelcoming project, though
there have been (and are) multiple efforts to change that with varying
degrees of success.
Hans de Goede talked about such efforts within his
corner of the kernel project in a talk (YouTube video) at
Open
Source Summit Europe.

[$] A policy for Link tags
[Kernel] Posted Sep 11, 2025 15:16 UTC (Thu) by corbet
The Git source-code management system stores a lot of information about
changes to code — but it does not hold everything that might be of interest
to a developer who needs to investigate a specific change in the future.
Commits in a repository are the end result of a (sometimes extended)
discussion; often, that discussion will result in changes to the code that
are not explained in the changelog.
For some years now, many maintainers
have followed the convention of applying a Link tag to commits that points
back to the mailing-list posting of the change.
Linus Torvalds has been
expressing his dislike for this convention for a while, though, and its
time appears to be coming to an end.

[$] How many ways are there to configure the Linux kernel?
[Kernel] Posted Sep 10, 2025 16:10 UTC (Wed) by daroc
There are a large number of ways to configure the 6.16
Linux kernel. It has 32,468 different configuration options on x86_64,
and a comparable number for other platforms. Exploring the ways the kernel can
be configured is sufficiently difficult that it requires specialized tools.
These show the
number of possible configurations that options can be combined in has
6,550 digits. How has that number changed over the history of the kernel, and
what does it mean for testing?

[$] KDE launches its own distribution (again)
[Distributions] Posted Sep 10, 2025 14:12 UTC (Wed) by jzb
At Akademy 2025, the
KDE Project released an
alpha version of KDE Linux, a
distribution built by the project to "include the best
implementation of everything KDE has to offer, using the most advanced
technologies". It is aimed at providing an operating system
suitable for home use, business use, OEM installations, and more
"eventually". For now there are many rough edges and missing
features that users should be aware of before taking the plunge; but
it is an interesting look at the kind of complete Linux system that
KDE developers would like to see.

[$] Introducing Space Grade Linux
[Distributions] Posted Sep 9, 2025 13:59 UTC (Tue) by jake
A new project, targeting Linux for the proverbial final frontier—outer
space—was the subject of a talk (YouTube video) at
the Embedded Linux Conference, which was held as part of Open
Source Summit Europe in Amsterdam in late August.
Ramón Roche
introduced Space Grade
Linux (SGL), which is currently incubating as a special interest group
(SIG) of the Embedding Linux in Safety
Applications (ELISA) project.
The idea is to create a distribution
with a base layer that can be used for off-planet missions of various
sorts, along with other layers that can be used to customize it for
different space-based use cases.

[$] Testing the 2-in-1 Framework 12 Laptop
[Front] Posted Sep 8, 2025 15:12 UTC (Mon) by jzb
Framework Computer is a US-based
computer manufacturer with a line of Linux-supported, modular, easily
repairable and upgradeable laptops. In February, the company announced
a new model, the Framework Laptop 12,
an "entry-level" 12.2-inch convertible notebook that can be
used as a laptop or tablet. The systems were made available for pre-order
in April, I received mine in mid-August. Since then, I have been
putting it through its paces with Debian 13 ("trixie") and
Fedora Linux 42. It's a good choice for users who want a
Linux-friendly, lightweight, 2-in-1
device—if they are willing to make a few concessions on storage
capacity, RAM, and CPU/GPU choices.

[$] Rug pulls, forks, and open-source feudalism
[Development] Posted Sep 5, 2025 14:48 UTC (Fri) by corbet
Like almost all human endeavors, open-source software development involves
a range of power dynamics.
Companies, developers, and users are all
concerned with the power to influence the direction of the software — and,
often, to profit from it.
At the 2025 Open
Source Summit Europe, Dawn Foster talked about how those dynamics can
play out, with an eye toward a couple of tactics — rug pulls and forks — that
are available to try to shift power in one direction or another.

Another npm supply-chain attack
[Security] Posted Sep 16, 2025 13:51 UTC (Tue) by corbet
The Socket.dev blog describes
this week's attack on JavaScript packages in the npm repository.
A malicious update to @ctrl/tinycolor (2.2M weekly
downloads) was detected on npm as part of a broader supply chain
attack that impacted more than 40 packages spanning multiple
maintainers.
The compromised versions include a function
(NpmModule.updatePackage) that downloads a package
tarball, modifies package.json, injects a local script
(bundle.js), repacks the archive, and republishes it,
enabling automatic trojanization of downstream packages.

Linux Plumbers Conference registration open
[Briefs] Posted Sep 15, 2025 22:18 UTC (Mon) by corbet
Registration for the 2025 Linux Plumbers Conference (Tokyo,
December 11 to 13) is
now open.
LPC tickets often sell out quickly, so it would be best not
to delay if you intend to attend.

Varnish 8.0.0 and bonus project news
[Development] Posted Sep 15, 2025 17:51 UTC (Mon) by jzb
Version
8.0.0 of Varnish Cache
has been released. In addition to a number
of changes to varnishd parameters, the ability to access some
runtime parameters using the Varnish Configuration Language, and other
improvements, 8.0.0 comes with big news; the project is forming an
organization called a forening
that will set out formal governance for the project.
The move also comes with a name change due to legal difficulties in
securing the Varnish Cache name:
The new association and the new project will be named "The Vinyl
Cache Project", and this release 8.0.0, will be the last under the
"Varnish Cache" name. The next release, in March will be under the new
name, and will include compatility scripts, to make the transition as
smooth as possible for everybody.
I want to make it absolutely clear that this is 100% a mess of my
making: I should have insisted on a firm written agreement about the
name sharing, but I did not.
I will also state for the record, that there are no hard feelings
between Varnish Software and the FOSS project.
Varnish Software has always been, and still is, an important and
valued contributor to the FOSS project, but sometimes even friends can
make a mess of a situation.

How FOSS Projects Handle Legal Takedown Requests (F-Droid)
[Briefs] Posted Sep 11, 2025 14:34 UTC (Thu) by corbet
The F-Droid project has some
advice for free-software projects on how to deal with takedown
requests.
As part of our legal resilience research, we spoke with a range of
legal experts, software freedom advocates, and maintainers of
mature FOSS infrastructure to understand how others manage these
moments. In this article, we share what we learned, and how F-Droid
is incorporating these lessons into its own approach.
