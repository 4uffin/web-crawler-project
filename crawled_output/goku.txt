About
Joined VTree on October 2020.
Loves to take control of the situation.
Good at JAVA, Golang, MongoDb, Flutter, MySQL, C, C++.
Familiar with Windows and Linux Platforms.
I always enjoy a challenge, and can work well under pressure; my other strengths are a strong commitment to customer services, and attention to detail. I am highly motivated and enjoy challenges within a new or existing role, and feel I am flexible enough to meet the needs of any degree course.
