Outstanding work. Holmes did well, she knew exactly where that try line was. That is exactly how the Black Ferns would have wanted to start that second half.

New Zealand overplay it in their own zone. Jorja Miller throws the ball straight into touch.

We've just been told the rules by the stadium announcer of what happens if the game finishes in a draw. That alone sums up how mad this result currently is.Expect a big response from New Zealand.
