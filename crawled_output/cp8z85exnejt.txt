Aphiwe Ngwevu is not a conventional inside centre, the South Africa 12 is basically an extra forward.I wonder if they can keep up this intensity?

Penalty number seven.South Africa continue to knock on the door. But still no points to show for their dominance over the World Champions.

There is going to have to be a point where they have racked up too many penalties and someone will go to the bin.
