The problem is that our thoughts, opinions, and ultimately actions are the product of our exposure. Social media gives a small number of companies (and their algorithms) unparalleled and unchecked control over our exposure.We should be educating children at a young age about the benefits and risks of social media. We haven't adapted the way we educate society in light of massive tech changes.This will likely be a topic that future humans look back on and wonder why we did this to ourselves.replyLerc 4 hours ago

Part of me thinks that if the case against social media was stronger, it would not be being litigated on substack.A lot of things suck right now.
Social media definitely give us the ability to see that.
Using your personal ideology to link correlations is not the same thing as finding causation.There will be undoubtedly be some damaging aspects of social media, simply because it is large and complex.
It would be highly unlikely that all those factors always aligned in the direction of good.All too often a collection of cherry picked studies are presented in books targeting the worried public.
It can build a public opinion that is at odds with the data.
Some people write books just to express their ideas.
Others like Jonathan Haidt seem to think that putting their efforts into convincing as many people as possible of their ideology is preferable to putting effort into demonstrating that their ideas are true.
There is this growing notion that perception is reality,
convince enough people and it is true.I am prepared to accept aspects of social media are bad.
Clearly identify why and how and perhaps we can make progress addressing each thing.
Declaring it's all bad acts as a deterrent to removing faults.
I become very sceptical when many disparate threads of the same thing seem to coincidentally turn out to be bad.
That suggests either there is an underlying reason that has been left unstated and unproven or the information I have been presented with is selective.replyAunche 1 minute ago

> I am prepared to accept aspects of social media are bad. Clearly identify why and how and perhaps we can make progress addressing each thing.Companies intentionally design social media to be as addictive as possible, which should be enough to declare them as bad. Should we also identify each chemical in a vape and address each one individually as well before banning them for children? I think such a ban for social media would probably be overkill, but it should not be controversial to ban phone use in school.replyushiroda80 15 minutes ago
| parent | prev | next [–]
I don't think reasoning needs to be that complex. Addictive things are harmful, social media is design to be addictive (and is increasing). There is a correlation of higher addictiveness with harm. Children in particular are vulnerable for addictive things. So given the above, the expectation for social media which is highly addictive is that it would be highly harmful, unless there are clear
reasons that it's not harmful.replyLlamamoe 3 hours ago

I feel like regardless of all else, the fact of algorithmic curation is going to be bad, especially when it's contaminated by corporate and/or political interests.We have evolved to parse information as if its prevalence is controlled by how much people talk about it, how acceptable opinions are to voice, how others react to them. Algorithmic social media intrinsically destroy that. They change how information spreads, but not how we parse its spread.It's parasocial at best, and very possibly far worse at worst.replyarmchairhacker 1 hour ago

No doubt the specific algorithms used by social media companies are bad. But what is "non-algorithmic" curation?Chronological order: promotes spam, which will be mostly paid actors. Manual curation by "high-quality, trusted" curators: who are they, and how will they find content? Curation by friends and locals: this is probably an improvement over what we have now, but it's still dominated by friends and locals who are more outspoken and charismatic; moreover, it's hard to maintain, because curious people will try going outside their community, especially those who are outcasts.EDIT: Also, studies have shown people focus more on negative (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) and sensational (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salience_(neuroscience)#Salien...) things (and thus post/upvote/view them more), so an algorithm that doesn't explicitly push negativity and sensationalism may appear to.replyrightbyte 1 hour ago

I have wondered if it's not algorithmic curation per-se that is the problem, but personalised algorithmic curation.When each person is receiving a personalised feed, there is a significant loss of common experience.
You are not seeing what others are seeing and that creates a loss of a basis of communication.I have considered the possibility that the solution might be to enable many areas of curation but in each domain the thing people see is the same for everyone.
In essence, subreddits.
The problem then becomes the nature of the curators,
subreddits show that human curators are also not ideal.
Is there an opportunity for public algorithm curation.
You subscribe to the algorithm itself and see the same thing as everyone else who subscribes sees.
The curation is neutral (but will be subject to gaming, the fight against bad actors will be perpetual in all areas).I agree about the tendency for the prevalence of conversation to influence individuals,
but I think it can be resisted.
I don't think humans live their lives controlled by their base instincts,
most learn to find a better way.
It is part of why I do not like the idea of de-platforming.
I found it quite instructional when Jon Stewart did an in-depth piece on trans issues.
It made an extremely good argument,
but it infuriated me to see a few days later so many people talking about how great it was because Jon agreed with them and he reaches so many people.
They completely missed the point.
The reason it was good is because it made a good case.
This cynical "It's good if it reaches the conclusion we want and lots of people" is what is destroying us.
Once you feel like it is not necessary to make your case, but just shout the loudest, you lose the ability to win over people who disagree because they don't like you shouting and you haven't made your case.replymajormajor 3 hours ago

It's increasingly discussed in traditional media too so let's toss out that first line glib dismissal.More and more people declaring it's net-negative is the first step towards changing anything. Academic "let's evaluate each individual point about it on its own merits" is not how this sort of thing finds political momentum.(Or we could argue that "social media" in the Facebook-era sense is just one part of a larger entity, "the internet," that we're singling out.)replyLerc 2 hours ago

I did not consider it a glib dismissal, and I would not consider traditional media an appropriate avenue to litigate this either.
Trial by media is a term used to describe something that generally think shouldn't occur.The appropriate place to find out what is and isn't true is research.
Do research,
write papers, discuss results,
resolve contradictions in findings, reach consensus.The media should not be deciding what is true,
they should be reporting what they see.
Importantly they should make clear that the existence of a thing is not the same thing as the prevalence of a thing.>Academic "let's evaluate each individual point about it on its own merits" is not how this sort of thing finds political momentum.I think much of my post was in effect saying that a good deal of the problem is the belief that building political momentum is more important than accuracy.replyautoexec 37 minutes ago

> The media should not be deciding what is true, they should be reporting what they see.Largely I don't think the media has been dictating anything. They've just been reporting on the growing body of evidence showing that social media is harmful.What you'd call "trial by media" is just spreading awareness and discussion of the evidence we have so far which seems like a very good thing. Social media moves faster than scientific consensus, and there's a long history of industry doing everything they can to slow that process down and muddy the waters. We've seen facebook doing exactly that already by burying child safety research.A decade or more of "Do thing, say nothing" is not a sound strategy when the alternative is letting the public know about the existing research we have showing real harms and letting them decide for themselves what steps to take on an individual level and what concerns to bring to their representatives who could decide policy to mitigate those harms or even dedicate funding to further study them.replydelusional 3 hours ago

> More and more people declaring it's net-negative is the first step towards changing anything.I accept that "net-negative" is a cultural shorthand, but I really wish we could go beyond it. I don't think people are suddenly looking at both sides of the equation and evaluating rationally that their social media interactions are net negative.I think what's happening is a change in the novelty of social media. That is, the the net value is changing. Originally, social media was fun and novel, but once that novelty wears away it's flat and lifeless. It's sort of abstractly interesting to discuss tech with likeminded people on HN, but once we get past the novelty, I don't know any of you. Behind the screen-names is a sea of un-identifiable faces that I have to assume are like-minded to have any interesting discussions with, but which are most certainly not like me at all. Its endless discussions with people who don't care.I think that's what you're seeing. A society caught up in the novelty, losing that naive enjoyment. Not a realization of met effects.replylogicchains 3 hours ago

The difference between traditional and social media is not just technical.

I wish to quibble with you on this as there is a love/hate relationship between the conventional media and social media.The mainstream media have several sources, including the press releases that get sent to them, the newswires they get their main news from and social media.In the UK the press, in particular, the BBC, were early adopters of Twitter. Most of the population would not have heard of it had it not been for the journalists at the BBC. The journalists thought it was the best thing since the invention of the printing press. Latterly Instagram has become an equally useful source to them and, since Twitter became X, there is less copying and pasting tweets.The current U.S. President seems capable of dictatorship via social media, so following his messages on social media is what the press do. I doubt any journalist has been on whitehouse.gov for a long time, the regular web and regular sources have been demoted.replykrapp 3 hours ago

I'm struggling to understand your point, especially since the conclusion you posit is rather glib and dismissive.Net-negative is not quantifiable.
But it is definitely qualifiable.I don't think you have to think of things in terms of "hate it more than I like it" when you have actual examples on social media of children posting self-harm and suicide, hooliganism and outright crimes posted for viewership, blatant misinformation proliferation, and the unbelievable broad and deep affect powerful entities can have on public information/opinion through SM.I think we can agree all of these are bad, and a net-negative, without needing any mathematic rigor.replykrapp 2 hours ago

My point is that "More and more people declaring social media net-negative" doesn't mean anything, and it certainly isn't a valid "first step towards changing anything" because it isn't actionable.>I don't think you have to think of things in terms of "hate it more than I like it" when you have actual examples on social media of children posting self-harm and suicide, hooliganism and outright crimes posted for viewership, blatant misinformation proliferation, and the unbelievable broad and deep affect powerful entities can have on public information/opinion through SM.Sure, and then there's plenty of children not posting self-harm and suicide, hooliganism and outright crimes posted for viewership, and plenty of information and perfectly normal, non-harmful communication and interaction. "net-negative" implies there is far more harmful content than non-harmful, and that most people using social media are using it in a negative way, which seems more like a bias than anything proven. I can agree that there are harmful and negative aspects of social media without agreeing that the majority of social media content and usage is harmful and negative.replysedawkgrep 35 minutes ago

While I appreciate the idea that moving without factual data is often detrimental (which is what I believe you're implying here), I don't share the opinion that SM deserves any benefit of the doubt.I'm old enough to have lived as an adult pre-SM, and from my perspective the overwhelming impact of social media has been more inflammatory, degrading, divisive, etc., etc., etc., than whatever positives you think you're getting.A family friend's teenage daughter isn't allowed a cell phone, and thus has zero presence or view into SM spaces.
Unlike nearly all her friends, she doesn't suffer from depression, anxiety, or any other common malady that is so prevalent today with the youth.
Yes it's anecdotal, but it's also stark.We got along just fine before SM, and we'd be just fine again without it.replysolid_fuel 3 hours ago

There a lot of money in social media, literally hundreds of billions of dollars.
I expect the case against it will continue to grow, like the case against cigarettes did.I will say this, and this is anecdotal, but other events this week have been an excellent case study in how fast misinformation (charitably) and lies (uncharitably) spread across social media, and how much social media does to amp up the anger and tone of people.
When I open Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram, or any of the smaller networks I see people baying for blood.
Quite literally.
But when I talk to my friends, or look at how people are acting in the street, I don't see that.

The primary method that people had to discover that this information was incorrect was social media.I agree with your point here too, and I don't think the solution is to completely stop or get rid of social media.
But, the problem I see is there are tons of corners of social media where you can still see the original lies being repeated as if they are fact.
In some spaces they get challenged, but in others they are echoed and repeated uncritically.
That is what concerns me - long debunked rumors and lies that get repeated because they feel good.> If anything education is required to teach people to discuss opposing views without rising to anger or personal attacks.I think many people are actually capable of discussing opposing views without it becoming so inflammatory... in person.
But algorithmic amplification online works against that and the strongest, loudest, quickest view tends to win in the attention landscape.My concern is that social media is lowering people's ability to discuss things calmly, because instead of a discussion amongst acquaintances everything is an argument is against strangers.
And that creates a dynamic where people who come to argue are not arguing against just you, but against every position they think you hold.
We presort our opponents into categories based on perceived allegiance and then attack the entire image, instead of debating the actual person.But I don't know if that can fixed behaviorally, because the challenge of social media is that the crowd is effectively infinite.
The same arguments get repeated thousands of times, and there's not even a guarantee that the person you are arguing against is a real person and not just a paid employee, or a bot.
That frustration builds into a froth because the debate never moves, it just repeats.replyLerc 2 hours ago

There's a concerted assault on social media from the powers that be because social media is essentially decentralised media, much harder for authoritarians to shape and control than centralised media. Social media is why the masses have finally risen up in opposition to what Israel's been doing in Gaza, even though the genocide has been going on for over half a century: decentralised information transmission allowed people to see the reality of what's really going on there.replybeeflet 18 minutes ago

It's not decentralized at all. It represents a total commercialization of the town square.The situation you reference with regard to Israel/Gaza is only possible because TikTok is partially controlled by Chinese interests. But it also goes to show that TikTok could have easily been banned or censored by western governments. Just kick them off the App Stores and block the servers. For example, there is no support Net Neutrality in the USA that would defend them if the government wanted to quietly throttle their network speed.Social media as it exists now is not decentralized in any meaningful capacity.replyblitz_skull 3 hours ago

>the intense chilling effect that zero anonymity would have on political dissentChilling the discourse would be a feature, not a bug. In fact what discourse in most places these days needs is a reduction in temperature.This kind of defence of anonymity is grounded in the anthropologically questionable assumption that when you are anonymous you are "who you really are" and when you face consequences for what you say you don't. But the reality is, we're socialized beings and anonymity tends to turn people into mini-sociopaths. I have many times, in particular when I was younger said things online behind anonymity that were stupid, incorrect, more callous, more immoral than I would have ever face-to-face.And that's not because that's what I really believed in any meaningful sense, it's because you often destroy any natural inhibition to behave like a well-adjusted human through anonymity and a screen.

Pretty easy to find them.The problem is the leaders of the large social media organizations do not care about the consequences of their platforms enough to change how they operate. They're fine with hosting extremist and offensive content, and allowing extremists to build large followings using their platforms. Heck, they even encourage it!replycramsession 2 hours ago

Social media would be entirely different if there were no monetization on political content. There's a whole lot of ragebaiting/engagement-farming for views.

Strangely I never see political content on YouTube. Maybe the algorithm worked out quickly I'm simply not interested. Whereas twitter/mastodon/bluesky are awash in it, to the point of making those platforms pretty unusable for me.I guess the difference is that YouTube content creators don't casually drop politics in because it will alienate half their audience and lose revenue.

To me this just reads like fear mongering and shilling for the status quo political establishment. I've recently been learning a bit about Russian history and it has similarities to their conservative nobility throughout the 19th century trying through various means to suppress the spread of liberalism in the public and intelligentsia: the point being that Russia had serious social ills like serfdom and radical political ideas were absolutely warranted. Social media is destabilizing for the influence of establishment sources of information and more of the public (right and left) is finding out more accurate information about how the world works, then coming to natural conclusions about how to address various social ills. Polarization may be increasing, but people forming stronger opinions is also exactly what you would expect in the face of increased revelation about unsolved social problems. Ultimately, I'm optimistic about the long term effects of social media on politics.replyjparishy 3 hours ago

Full anonymity in social media should not be allowed. It becomes a cover for bad actors (propagandists, agents, disinformation, bots, age-inappropriate, etc.) It doesn’t have to be a full identity, but knowing your user metadata is open during interactions can instill a sense of responsibility and consequence of social action.

Looking at any random fullrealname Facebook account will disabuse you of this notion. People will tie vile shit to their identities without a second thought.Rather than sacrifice the cover that anonymity grants vulnerable people, journalists, and activists, I think we should come at this issue by placing restrictions on how social media platforms direct people to information. The impulse to restrict and censor individuals rather than restrict powerful organizations profiting from algorithmic promotion of the content you deem harmful is deeply troubling.The first step here is simple: identify social media platforms over some size threshold, and require that any content promotion or algorithmic feed mechanism they use is dead-simple to understand and doesn't target individuals. That avoids the radicalization rabbithole problem. Make the system trivial and auditable. If they fail the audit then they're not allowed to have any recommendation system for a year. Just follows and a linear feed (sorting and filtering are allowed so long as they're exposed to the user).To reiterate: none of this applies if you're below some user cutoff.Q: Will this kill innovation in social media?

> cover that anonymity grants [] journalistsQuite the contrary, a core journalism principle is accountability and transparency. Readers must know who the reporter is to assess credibility, context, and potential conflicts of interest. Attribution builds trust, allows audiences to verify the source, and distinguishes reporting from anonymous or propagandistic material. This is different from covering source anonymity, but the audience is still relying on the journalist’s _known_ integrity that they’re not just making up some bullshit source.replymakeitdouble 2 hours ago

Real life needs full anonymity too. Not everywhere, but it's critical to have some.For instance a political vote needs to be anonymous. Access to public space typically is (you're not required to identify to walk the street) even if that anonymity can be lifted etc.Real life is complex, and for good reasons, if we want to take it as a model we should integrate it's full complexity as well.replyhbarka 54 minutes ago

In the United States, political votes are not anonymous. There is a database of how someone voted.If you’re out in public, you’re also not fully anonymous.

It's more specific than social media. It's engagement maximizing (read: addiction maximizing) algorithms. Social media wasn't nearly as bad until algorithmic engagement maximizing feeds replaced temporal or topic based feeds and user-directed search.Two people walk past you on the street. One says "hi," and the other strips naked and smears themselves with peanut butter and starts clucking like a chicken. Which one maximizes engagement?A politician says something sane and reasonable. Another politician mocks someone, insults someone, or says something completely asinine. Which one maximizes engagement?This is why our president is a professional troll, many of our public intellectuals are professional trolls, and politics is becoming hyper-polarized into raging camps fixated on crazy extremes. It maximizes engagement.The "time on site" KPI is literally destroying civilization by biasing public discourse toward trash.I think "trash maximizes engagement" should be considered an established fact at this point. If you A/B test for engagement you will converge on a mix of trolling, tabloid sensationalism, fear porn, outrage porn, and literal porn, and that’s our public discourse.replyscarface_74 4 hours ago

As someone whose grandparents endured Jim Crow, I largely agree in the sense that social media did not create America’s divides.
Many of the divides in American society are very old and are very deep, with no easy fixes.Unfortunately algorithmic social media is one of the factors adding fuel to the fire, and I believe it’s fair to say that social media has helped increase polarization by recommending content to its viewers purely based on engagement metrics without any regard for the consequences of pushing such content.
It is much easier to whip people into a frenzy this way.
Additionally, echo chambers make it harder for people to be exposed to other points of view.
Combine this with dismal educational outcomes for many Americans (including a lack of critical thinking skills), our two-party system that aggregates diverse political views into just two options, a first-past-the-post election system that forces people to choose “the lesser of two evils,” and growing economic pain, and these factors create conditions that are ripe for strife.replydfxm12 2 hours ago

Unfortunately algorithmic social media is one of the factors adding fuel to the fireSaying social media fans the flames is like saying ignorance is bliss. Mainstream media (cable news, radio, newspapers, etc) only gives us one, largely conservative, viewpoint. If you're lucky, you'll get one carefully controlled opposing viewpoint (out of many!). As you say, our choices are usually evil and not quite as evil.Anger is not an unreasonable reaction when you realize this. When you realize that other viewpoints exist, the mainstream media and politicians are not acting in anyone's best interest but their own, there really are other options (politically, for news, etc.). Social media is good at bringing these things to light.There are no easy fixes to the divides you're talking about, but failing to confront them and just giving in to the status quo, or worse, continuing down our current reactionary transcript, is probably the worst way to approach them.replyscarface_74 3 hours ago

One of the factors that led to the Rwandan genocide was the broadcast of the RLTM radio stationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide#Radio_station...The radio didn't create the divide, and it wasn't the sole factor in the genocide, but it engrained in the population a sense of urgency in eliminating the Tutsi, along with a stream of what was mostly fake news to show that the other side is already commiting the atrocities against HutusWhen the genocide happened, it was fast and widespread: people would start killing their own neighbors at scale. In 100 days, a million people were killed.The trouble with social media is that they somehow managed to shield themselves from the legal repercussions of heavily promoting content similar to what RTLM broadcast.
