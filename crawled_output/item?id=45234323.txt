Part of me thinks that if the case against social media was stronger, it would not be being litigated on substack.A lot of things suck right now.
Social media definitely give us the ability to see that.
Using your personal ideology to link correlations is not the same thing as finding causation.There will be undoubtedly be some damaging aspects of social media, simply because it is large and complex.
It would be highly unlikely that all those factors always aligned in the direction of good.All too often a collection of cherry picked studies are presented in books targeting the worried public.
It can build a public opinion that is at odds with the data.
Some people write books just to express their ideas.
Others like Jonathan Haidt seem to think that putting their efforts into convincing as many people as possible of their ideology is preferable to putting effort into demonstrating that their ideas are true.
There is this growing notion that perception is reality,
convince enough people and it is true.I am prepared to accept aspects of social media are bad.
Clearly identify why and how and perhaps we can make progress addressing each thing.
Declaring it's all bad acts as a deterrent to removing faults.
I become very sceptical when many disparate threads of the same thing seem to coincidentally turn out to be bad.
That suggests either there is an underlying reason that has been left unstated and unproven or the information I have been presented with is selective.replyprocaryote 4 hours ago

> Part of me thinks that if the case against social media was stronger, it would not be being litigated on substack.It's litigated all over and has been for a decade.Australia for example has set an age limit of 16 to have social media. France 15. Schools or countries are trying various phone bans. There's research into it. There are whistleblowers telling about Facebook's own research they've suppressed as it would show some of their harm.Perhaps you spend too much time on social media?replyzarzavat 2 hours ago

You’re strengthening OP’s point instead of undermining it.The “some governments banned it for kids” argument is an appeal to authority, a logical fallacy.The actions of tech-reactionist leftist governments absolutely do not constitute sound science or evidence in this matter.And if you’re claiming the French government only makes government policy based on sound data, I will point you to their currently unraveling government over the mathematically impossible social pension scheme they’ve created.replyprocaryote 2 hours ago

Responding to the point "it's [only] litigated on substack", things like government bans are relevant counter-examplesThe bans might be unfounded or well founded, you might agree with them or not, but clearly the idea that social media might be bad has spread beyond substackreplythrow4847285 2 hours ago

Your argument contains the fallacy fallacy, a logical fallacy in which one wrongly cites an informal fallacy in order to discredit a valid argument.The actions of several democratic governments is evidence that there is enough popular support for these actions to argue for a broader trend. And before you try for a gotcha, I am well aware that a democratic government can enact regulations without a direct vote proving that a majority of people support such an action. But inasmuch as a government reflects the will of the governed, etc etc etc.replyLlamamoe 13 hours ago

I feel like regardless of all else, the fact of algorithmic curation is going to be bad, especially when it's contaminated by corporate and/or political interests.We have evolved to parse information as if its prevalence is controlled by how much people talk about it, how acceptable opinions are to voice, how others react to them. Algorithmic social media intrinsically destroy that. They change how information spreads, but not how we parse its spread.It's parasocial at best, and very possibly far worse at worst.replyarmchairhacker 11 hours ago

No doubt the specific algorithms used by social media companies are bad. But what is "non-algorithmic" curation?Chronological order: promotes spam, which will be mostly paid actors. Manual curation by "high-quality, trusted" curators: who are they, and how will they find content? Curation by friends and locals: this is probably an improvement over what we have now, but it's still dominated by friends and locals who are more outspoken and charismatic; moreover, it's hard to maintain, because curious people will try going outside their community, especially those who are outcasts.EDIT: Also, studies have shown people focus more on negative (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) and sensational (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salience_(neuroscience)#Salien...) things (and thus post/upvote/view them more), so an algorithm that doesn't explicitly push negativity and sensationalism may appear to.replyrightbyte 11 hours ago

Not really? On something like Xenforo2, there's a setting that makes a new account's posts invisible until that account is manually approved by a mod - in conjunction with the spam prevention tools - https://xenforo.com/docs/xf2/spam/#content - we really don't need to do much work.Because all new accounts need to be verified by an actual human, we can filter out 99% of spam before other users see it, and between a dozen mods for a community of 140k people we only need to spend ~15 minutes a week cleaning out spam.replynradov 7 hours ago

I've been curating my own feeds manually for decades now. I choose who to follow, and actively seek out methods of social media use that are strictly based on my selections and show things in reverse chronological order. Even Facebook can do thus with the right URL if you use it via the web[1].You start with almost nothing on a given platform but over time you build up a wide variety of sources that you can continue to monitor for quality and predictive power over time.[1] https://www.facebook.com/?sk=h_chrreplypyrale 2 hours ago

It doesn't even matter whether the algorithm is trained specifically on negative content. The result is the same: negative content is promoted more because it sees more engagement.The result is more discontent in society, people are constantly angry about something. Anger makes a reasonable discussion impossible which in turn causes polarisation and extremes in society and politics. What we're seeing all over the world.And the user sourced content is a problem too because it can be used for anyone to run manipulation campaigns. At least with traditional media there was an editor who would make sure fact checking was done. The social media platforms don't stand for the content they publish.replynradov 7 hours ago

Social media should be liable for the content that their automatic curation put forward. If a telecom company actively gives your number to scammers to call you up, they should not hide behind the argument that it is not them scamming you, but someone else. Applying regular anti-fraud and defamation laws will probably put an end to algorithmic curation.replyLerc 12 hours ago

I have wondered if it's not algorithmic curation per-se that is the problem, but personalised algorithmic curation.When each person is receiving a personalised feed, there is a significant loss of common experience.
You are not seeing what others are seeing and that creates a loss of a basis of communication.I have considered the possibility that the solution might be to enable many areas of curation but in each domain the thing people see is the same for everyone.
In essence, subreddits.
The problem then becomes the nature of the curators,
subreddits show that human curators are also not ideal.
Is there an opportunity for public algorithm curation.
You subscribe to the algorithm itself and see the same thing as everyone else who subscribes sees.
The curation is neutral (but will be subject to gaming, the fight against bad actors will be perpetual in all areas).I agree about the tendency for the prevalence of conversation to influence individuals,
but I think it can be resisted.
I don't think humans live their lives controlled by their base instincts,
most learn to find a better way.
It is part of why I do not like the idea of de-platforming.
I found it quite instructional when Jon Stewart did an in-depth piece on trans issues.
It made an extremely good argument,
but it infuriated me to see a few days later so many people talking about how great it was because Jon agreed with them and he reaches so many people.
They completely missed the point.
The reason it was good is because it made a good case.
This cynical "It's good if it reaches the conclusion we want and lots of people" is what is destroying us.

> the solution might be to enable many areas of curation but in each domain the thing people see is the same for everyone.Doesn't this already happen to some extent, with content being classified into advertiser-friendly bins and people's feeds being populated primarily by top content from within the bins the algorithm deems they have an interest in?>
Once you feel like it is not necessary to make your case, but just shout the loudest, you lose the ability to win over people who disagree because they don't like you shouting and you haven't made your case.To some extent, this is how human communication always worked.

It's increasingly discussed in traditional media too so let's toss out that first line glib dismissal.More and more people declaring it's net-negative is the first step towards changing anything. Academic "let's evaluate each individual point about it on its own merits" is not how this sort of thing finds political momentum.(Or we could argue that "social media" in the Facebook-era sense is just one part of a larger entity, "the internet," that we're singling out.)replyLerc 12 hours ago

I did not consider it a glib dismissal, and I would not consider traditional media an appropriate avenue to litigate this either.
Trial by media is a term used to describe something that generally think shouldn't occur.The appropriate place to find out what is and isn't true is research.
Do research,
write papers, discuss results,
resolve contradictions in findings, reach consensus.The media should not be deciding what is true,
they should be reporting what they see.
Importantly they should make clear that the existence of a thing is not the same thing as the prevalence of a thing.>Academic "let's evaluate each individual point about it on its own merits" is not how this sort of thing finds political momentum.I think much of my post was in effect saying that a good deal of the problem is the belief that building political momentum is more important than accuracy.replyTheOtherHobbes 1 hour ago

Weren’t you, in your initial post, suspicious that the research process was settling on a pessimistic consensus view? Figuring that, because most every formal study is coming up negative (or “no effect supported”), it must be that the research is selective and designed to manipulate? And that a phenomenon can’t exhibit a diversity of uniformly bad effects without “an underlying reason that has been left unstated and unproven”?I don’t know how I’d state or prove a single underlying reason why most vices are attractive-while-corrosive and still, on the whole, bad. It feels like priests and philosophers have tried for the whole human era to articulate a unified theory of exactly why, for example, “vanity is bad”. But I’m still comfortable saying gambling feels good and breaks material security, lust feels good and breaks contentment (and sometimes relationships), and social media feels good and breaks spirits.I certainly agree that “social media” feels uncomfortably imprecise as a category—shorthand for individualized feeds, incentives toward vain behavior, gambling-like reinforcement, ephemerality over structure, decontextualization, disindividuation, and so on; as well as potentially nice things like “seeing mom’s vacation pics.”If we were to accept that social media in its modern form, like other vices, “feels good in the short term and selectively stokes one’s ego,” would that be enough of a positive side to accept the possibility for uniformly negative long-run effects? For that matter, and this is very possible—is there a substantial body of research drawing positive conclusions that I’m not familiar with?replynon_aligned 8 hours ago

> The appropriate place to find out what is and isn't true is research. Do research, write papers, discuss results, resolve contradictions in findings, reach consensus.Few hot-button social issues are resolved via research, and I'm not sure they should be. On many divisive issues in social sciences, having a PhD doesn't shield you from working back from what you think the outcome ought to be, so political preferences become a pretty reliable predictor of published results. The consensus you get that way can be pretty shoddy too.More importantly, a lot of it involves complex moral judgments that can't really be reduced to formulas. For example, let's say that on average, social media doesn't make teen suicides significantly more frequent. But are OK with any number of teens killing themselves because of Instagram? Many people might categorically reject this for reasons that can't be dissected in utilitarian terms. That's just humanity.replyautoexec 10 hours ago

> The media should not be deciding what is true, they should be reporting what they see.Largely I don't think the media has been dictating anything. They've just been reporting on the growing body of evidence showing that social media is harmful.What you'd call "trial by media" is just spreading awareness and discussion of the evidence we have so far which seems like a very good thing. Social media moves faster than scientific consensus, and there's a long history of industry doing everything they can to slow that process down and muddy the waters. We've seen facebook doing exactly that already by burying child safety research.A decade or more of "Do thing, say nothing" is not a sound strategy when the alternative is letting the public know about the existing research we have showing real harms and letting them decide for themselves what steps to take on an individual level and what concerns to bring to their representatives who could decide policy to mitigate those harms or even dedicate funding to further study them.replypaganel 28 minutes ago

> More and more people declaring it's net-negative is the first step towards changing anything.I accept that "net-negative" is a cultural shorthand, but I really wish we could go beyond it. I don't think people are suddenly looking at both sides of the equation and evaluating rationally that their social media interactions are net negative.I think what's happening is a change in the novelty of social media. That is, the the net value is changing. Originally, social media was fun and novel, but once that novelty wears away it's flat and lifeless. It's sort of abstractly interesting to discuss tech with likeminded people on HN, but once we get past the novelty, I don't know any of you. Behind the screen-names is a sea of un-identifiable faces that I have to assume are like-minded to have any interesting discussions with, but which are most certainly not like me at all. Its endless discussions with people who don't care.I think that's what you're seeing. A society caught up in the novelty, losing that naive enjoyment.

I wish to quibble with you on this as there is a love/hate relationship between the conventional media and social media.The mainstream media have several sources, including the press releases that get sent to them, the newswires they get their main news from and social media.In the UK the press, in particular, the BBC, were early adopters of Twitter. Most of the population would not have heard of it had it not been for the journalists at the BBC. The journalists thought it was the best thing since the invention of the printing press. Latterly Instagram has become an equally useful source to them and, since Twitter became X, there is less copying and pasting tweets.The current U.S. President seems capable of dictatorship via social media, so following his messages on social media is what the press do.

I'm struggling to understand your point, especially since the conclusion you posit is rather glib and dismissive.Net-negative is not quantifiable.
But it is definitely qualifiable.I don't think you have to think of things in terms of "hate it more than I like it" when you have actual examples on social media of children posting self-harm and suicide, hooliganism and outright crimes posted for viewership, blatant misinformation proliferation, and the unbelievable broad and deep affect powerful entities can have on public information/opinion through SM.I think we can agree all of these are bad, and a net-negative, without needing any mathematic rigor.replykrapp 12 hours ago

My point is that "More and more people declaring social media net-negative" doesn't mean anything, and it certainly isn't a valid "first step towards changing anything" because it isn't actionable.>I don't think you have to think of things in terms of "hate it more than I like it" when you have actual examples on social media of children posting self-harm and suicide, hooliganism and outright crimes posted for viewership, blatant misinformation proliferation, and the unbelievable broad and deep affect powerful entities can have on public information/opinion through SM.Sure, and then there's plenty of children not posting self-harm and suicide, hooliganism and outright crimes posted for viewership, and plenty of information and perfectly normal, non-harmful communication and interaction. "net-negative" implies there is far more harmful content than non-harmful, and that most people using social media are using it in a negative way, which seems more like a bias than anything proven.

While I appreciate the idea that moving without factual data is often detrimental (which is what I believe you're implying here), I don't share the opinion that SM deserves any benefit of the doubt.I'm old enough to have lived as an adult pre-SM, and from my perspective the overwhelming impact of social media has been more inflammatory, degrading, divisive, etc., etc., etc., than whatever positives you think you're getting.A family friend's teenage daughter isn't allowed a cell phone, and thus has zero presence or view into SM spaces.
Unlike nearly all her friends, she doesn't suffer from depression, anxiety, or any other common malady that is so prevalent today with the youth.
Yes it's anecdotal, but it's also stark.We got along just fine before SM, and we'd be just fine again without it.replyAunche 9 hours ago

I don't think reasoning needs to be that complex. Addictive things are harmful, social media is design to be addictive (and is increasing). There is a correlation of higher addictiveness with harm.

There a lot of money in social media, literally hundreds of billions of dollars.
I expect the case against it will continue to grow, like the case against cigarettes did.I will say this, and this is anecdotal, but other events this week have been an excellent case study in how fast misinformation (charitably) and lies (uncharitably) spread across social media, and how much social media does to amp up the anger and tone of people.
When I open Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram, or any of the smaller networks I see people baying for blood.
Quite literally.

But, the problem I see is there are tons of corners of social media where you can still see the original lies being repeated as if they are fact.
In some spaces they get challenged, but in others they are echoed and repeated uncritically.
That is what concerns me - long debunked rumors and lies that get repeated because they feel good.> If anything education is required to teach people to discuss opposing views without rising to anger or personal attacks.I think many people are actually capable of discussing opposing views without it becoming so inflammatory... in person.
But algorithmic amplification online works against that and the strongest, loudest, quickest view tends to win in the attention landscape.My concern is that social media is lowering people's ability to discuss things calmly, because instead of a discussion amongst acquaintances everything is an argument is against strangers.
And that creates a dynamic where people who come to argue are not arguing against just you, but against every position they think you hold.
We presort our opponents into categories based on perceived allegiance and then attack the entire image, instead of debating the actual person.But I don't know if that can fixed behaviorally, because the challenge of social media is that the crowd is effectively infinite.
The same arguments get repeated thousands of times, and there's not even a guarantee that the person you are arguing against is a real person and not just a paid employee, or a bot.
That frustration builds into a froth because the debate never moves, it just repeats.replyLerc 12 hours ago

>No, the incentive to hide harm is being given as a reason that studies into harm would be suppressed, not as evidence of harm in and of itself. This is a direct response to your original remark that "Part of me thinks that if the case against social media was stronger, it would not be being litigated on substack."That seems like a fair argument.
I don't think it means that it grants opinions the weight of truth.
I think it would make it fair to identify and criticise suppression of research and advocate for a mechanism by which such research can be conducted.
An approach that I would support in this area was a tax or levy on companies with large numbers of users that could be ear-marked for funding independent research regarding the welfare of their user base and on society as a whole.>Short term gains always take precedence. That seems a far worthier problem to address.>If you dig through history there are hundreds of examples of companies knowingly harming their usersI don't deny that these things exist,

There's a concerted assault on social media from the powers that be because social media is essentially decentralised media, much harder for authoritarians to shape and control than centralised media. Social media is why the masses have finally risen up in opposition to what Israel's been doing in Gaza, even though the genocide has been going on for over half a century: decentralised information transmission allowed people to see the reality of what's really going on there.replybeeflet 10 hours ago

It's not decentralized at all. It represents a total commercialization of the town square.The situation you reference with regard to Israel/Gaza is only possible because TikTok is partially controlled by Chinese interests. But it also goes to show that TikTok could have easily been banned or censored by western governments. Just kick them off the App Stores and block the servers. For example, there is no support Net Neutrality in the USA that would defend them if the government wanted to quietly throttle their network speed.Social media as it exists now is not decentralized in any meaningful capacity.replygeoffbp 47 minutes ago

Now forms of socializing would emerge, which you could argue are more local and healthier for society.When talking about social media, I now ignore the more powerful arguments of how better the world could be without people spending hours on their smartphones, and focus on the problem that it's a surogate for socialization where everyone wants to sell you something, which most people seem to agree is wrong.replyhedayet 1 hour ago

>the intense chilling effect that zero anonymity would have on political dissentChilling the discourse would be a feature, not a bug. In fact what discourse in most places these days needs is a reduction in temperature.This kind of defence of anonymity is grounded in the anthropologically questionable assumption that when you are anonymous you are "who you really are" and when you face consequences for what you say you don't. But the reality is, we're socialized beings and anonymity tends to turn people into mini-sociopaths. I have many times, in particular when I was younger said things online behind anonymity that were stupid, incorrect, more callous, more immoral than I would have ever face-to-face.And that's not because that's what I really believed in any meaningful sense, it's because you often destroy any natural inhibition to behave like a well-adjusted human through anonymity and a screen.

I tend to agree, especially because the most harming political influencers are NOT (pseudo-)anonymous. But... it's not just a "bad thing" that is happening. It is the foundational destruction of free societies as we know them. Debates and democratic discourse are replaced with hate, oppression and violence.I believe that social dynamics like shame and consequences are disabled by pseudo-anonymzation. Pretty much the same effect as people becoming more aggressive and vocal in the confines of their cars. You'd never flip off random people in a supermarket as some would do for getting cut off in traffic.This substack posts a few interesting theories and ideas how that comes to be. However, the most concerning to me is the asymmetric impact of emotional manipulation due to social media enabled network dynamics.In particular:> Online discussions are dominated by a surprisingly small, extremely vocal, and non-representative minority. Research on social media has found that, while only 3% of active accounts are toxic, they produce 33% of all content. Furthermore, 74% of all online conflicts are started in just 1% of communities, and 0.1% of users shared 80% of fake news. Not only does this extreme minority stir discontent, spread misinformation, and spark outrage online, they also bias the meta-perceptions of most users who passively “lurk” online.The brain responds to alarmist, negative and distressing information with much higher priority. At the same time, very few radical and extreme influencers can utilize this mechanism, amplified by social media trying to boost ad revenue. Counterfactual information which directly appeals to the biases and psychology of users is posted and wrapped into click-baity designs to maximize attention and revenue. Tribes are forming and very few elite users can steer the information consumption of users - not just what but also how.This is highly damaging to society and there is no more institutional trust anywhere to retrieve reliable information on which discussions can be based. Everyone selectively chooses their "reliable sources". This is the absolute opposite of how PKI works, it's like everyone just picks the Root Certs they like (for us techies).This is of course ironic because all studies and knowledge humanity has to offer are a single search prompt away. But it simply doesn't matter if institutional trust is gone and studies are dismissed because they are coming from "woke" or "radical right wing" sources - completely obliterating what we are trying to achieve with peer review and so on.replysporkxrocket 10 hours ago

| root | parent | next [–]
Firstly, there is still pretty centralized moderation done through the bureaucracy of mastodon operators and federation. Similar situation in bluesky. The whole advantage of these "networks" is that they allow you to opt-in to blocklists. A federation essentially becomes a massive aggregation of blocklists, because members that do not obey the blocking policies of others will become defederated. These aren't really opt-in consent-based social spaces here because the vast majority of the "consent" is still delegated by a third party.These networks appeal to control freaks who subscribe to many massive blocklists so they don't have to confront challenging ideas. I oppose them on the grounds that being a control freak is bad for the individual and society in general.Unfortunately, we are all unwelcome participants in society at large. This is the idea behind protests for example. Real life is not consent-based, so the more time you spend in these networks the more poorly acclimated to reality you will become and the more removed you will be from the public arena of ideas.The ill-effects are that whatever (political?) faction that embraces these sort of networks will become mentally weak and will continue to lose debates, and eventually (political?) power.replyamatecha 2 hours ago

Echo chambers aren't good but the large scale social media I've tried has a tendency to put me in an echo chamber (specifically one trying to wring out all the engagement possible, often with stuff to make me angry) and also elevate low quality opinions (often factually incorrect or philosophically incoherent).Smaller and more personally curated social media has been better for sourcing broad opinions actually if I put just a little work into it.replyhomeonthemtn 11 hours ago

To me this just reads like fear mongering and shilling for the status quo political establishment. I've recently been learning a bit about Russian history and it has similarities to their conservative nobility throughout the 19th century trying through various means to suppress the spread of liberalism in the public and intelligentsia: the point being that Russia had serious social ills like serfdom and radical political ideas were absolutely warranted. Social media is destabilizing for the influence of establishment sources of information and more of the public (right and left) is finding out more accurate information about how the world works, then coming to natural conclusions about how to address various social ills. Polarization may be increasing, but people forming stronger opinions is also exactly what you would expect in the face of increased revelation about unsolved social problems.

It's more specific than social media. It's engagement maximizing (read: addiction maximizing) algorithms. Social media wasn't nearly as bad until algorithmic engagement maximizing feeds replaced temporal or topic based feeds and user-directed search.Two people walk past you on the street. One says "hi," and the other strips naked and smears themselves with peanut butter and starts clucking like a chicken. Which one maximizes engagement?A politician says something sane and reasonable. Another politician mocks someone, insults someone, or says something completely asinine. Which one maximizes engagement?This is why our president is a professional troll, many of our public intellectuals are professional trolls, and politics is becoming hyper-polarized into raging camps fixated on crazy extremes. It maximizes engagement.The "time on site" KPI is literally destroying civilization by biasing public discourse toward trash.I think "trash maximizes engagement" should be considered an established fact at this point. If you A/B test for engagement you will converge on a mix of trolling, tabloid sensationalism, fear porn, outrage porn, and literal porn, and that’s our public discourse.replyscarface_74 14 hours ago

As someone whose grandparents endured Jim Crow, I largely agree in the sense that social media did not create America’s divides.
Many of the divides in American society are very old and are very deep, with no easy fixes.Unfortunately algorithmic social media is one of the factors adding fuel to the fire, and I believe it’s fair to say that social media has helped increase polarization by recommending content to its viewers purely based on engagement metrics without any regard for the consequences of pushing such content.
It is much easier to whip people into a frenzy this way.
Additionally, echo chambers make it harder for people to be exposed to other points of view.
Combine this with dismal educational outcomes for many Americans (including a lack of critical thinking skills), our two-party system that aggregates diverse political views into just two options, a first-past-the-post election system that forces people to choose “the lesser of two evils,” and growing economic pain, and these factors create conditions that are ripe for strife.replydfxm12 12 hours ago

As you say, our choices are usually evil and not quite as evil.Anger is not an unreasonable reaction when you realize this. When you realize that other viewpoints exist, the mainstream media and politicians are not acting in anyone's best interest but their own, there really are other options (politically, for news, etc.). Social media is good at bringing these things to light.There are no easy fixes to the divides you're talking about, but failing to confront them and just giving in to the status quo, or worse, continuing down our current reactionary transcript, is probably the worst way to approach them.replyscarface_74 13 hours ago

One of the factors that led to the Rwandan genocide was the broadcast of the RLTM radio stationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide#Radio_station...The radio didn't create the divide, and it wasn't the sole factor in the genocide, but it engrained in the population a sense of urgency in eliminating the Tutsi, along with a stream of what was mostly fake news to show that the other side is already commiting the atrocities against HutusWhen the genocide happened, it was fast and widespread: people would start killing their own neighbors at scale. In 100 days, a million people were killed.The trouble with social media is that they somehow managed to shield themselves from the legal repercussions of heavily promoting content similar to what RTLM broadcast.

Looking at any random fullrealname Facebook account will disabuse you of this notion. People will tie vile shit to their identities without a second thought.Rather than sacrifice the cover that anonymity grants vulnerable people, journalists, and activists, I think we should come at this issue by placing restrictions on how social media platforms direct people to information. The impulse to restrict and censor individuals rather than restrict powerful organizations profiting from algorithmic promotion of the content you deem harmful is deeply troubling.The first step here is simple: identify social media platforms over some size threshold, and require that any content promotion or algorithmic feed mechanism they use is dead-simple to understand and doesn't target individuals. That avoids the radicalization rabbithole problem. Make the system trivial and auditable. If they fail the audit then they're not allowed to have any recommendation system for a year. Just follows and a linear feed (sorting and filtering are allowed so long as they're exposed to the user).To reiterate: none of this applies if you're below some user cutoff.Q: Will this kill innovation in social media?
