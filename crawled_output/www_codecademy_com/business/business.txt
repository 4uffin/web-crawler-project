Adam GodsonChief Product Officer at ParadoxAt The Motley Fool, our purpose is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer — and this includes our employees. Codecademy has been an asset in our efforts to increase technical skills around various points of the company, and move training participants from unfamiliar-to-conversant and from conversant-to-practitioners in the realm of coding.
Johnnie WeathersbySenior BI Data Analyst at The Motley FoolMy experience has been very positive. I feel like I can complete micro-lessons and make progress even on days I don’t have much time to allocate for self-development. Codecademy is an effective platform to learn programming languages and technical topics for users who may not always have consistent time to commit to learning. Moreover, it makes technical topics more approachable for less technical users.
