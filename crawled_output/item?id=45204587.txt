My wife and I are complete opposites. One of us processes data instantaneously, connecting it to dozens of other topics at the flip of a switch, and integrating broad knowledge. This makes for a great member of, say, a tiger team.The other thinks slowly, often has no initial opinion, and rarely speaks up, but when they do, the input is flawless and monumental. R&D is their forté.Neither one is better than the other. The quick thinker handles in-the-moment action well, but is so wrapped up in the “now” that it’s difficult for them to get too deep on a topic. The slow thinker meditates on ideas for a while, carefully chooses (almost always the correct) path, and steadies the course. Prick and pull at this one for a quick thought, and it comes out flatter than you could imagine.Until we know what actual intelligence is, trying to act like one form is objectively better than another is just silly.I think lots of the graybeard devs are deep thinkers, not fast thinkers. I think fast thinkers were pulled towards the “move fast and break things”-style companies.replyzubspace 3 hours ago

I also thought about this a lot. Some things about slow thinking are great. I truly believe that it helped me thrive as a software developer.But social interactions are awkward. I can't really come up with things to say easily and lots of times I can't respond in ways to keep the conversation going. Only after the fact I get lots of ideas of what I could have said. I'm truly impressed about others who can just come up with interesting or funny things to say on the spot.I'm a tad older, so I stopped caring about it and just accepted my slow thinking. But I'm sure that I also missed out on a lot of opportunities regarding friendships or work. I still think, that others perceive me as awkward or just not fun and it's hard to just ignore that.Funnily my wife is completely opposite to me and we have the greatest time.replySwizec 2 hours ago

> I'm truly impressed about others who can just come up with interesting or funny things to say on the spot.As Winston Churchill once said when asked “what are you doing” –> “Oh just preparing my off-the-cuff remarks for tomorrow”I’m one of those weirdos who does public speaking sometimes. Even 8 hour workshops. You cannot prepare for an 8 hour speaking engagement. Not really. But you can accumulate a plethora of anecdotes, metaphors, and remarks that you weave into the narrative or in response to questions.You can build frameworks that are similar to code. Prepared functions/coroutines/objects that you run in appropriate situations. Works pretty well especially in mentoring/teaching/consulting situations. This is also how comedians prep their sets.The key is that things you say are new to the audience, but not to you. It can be the same metaphor you’ve fine-tuned over dozens of interactions. And the person you’re talking to thinks “Wow that guy is so quick on his feet, how did he come up with that so fast!?”You can also spot this if you watch talks by popular presenters (Simon Sinek is a good example). You’ll notice the same 2 or 3 core stories getting polished and fine-tuned over years of talks and interviews.replysaghm 2 hours ago

When I was super young, I used to think my dad (who everyone I met seemed to think was extremely funny) had a huge repitoire of hilarious stories, but after a few years I noticed him repeating them and realized he just had a few specific ones that he would re-use with new people, like you mentioned. As someone who tends to be pretty slow to learn how to navigate new social situations, it was eye-opening when I recognized this was something I could do. What's amusing to me at this point is that I'm still not sure he fully realizes that this is something he does sometimes, because he'll still sometimes try to whip out one of the stories when talking to me and then genuinely be surprised when I remind him of some very minor detail about it that he forgot to mention this time he told it.replygodelski 59 minutes ago

> “Oh just preparing my off-the-cuff remarks for tomorrow”
That actually reminds me something I head from Corridor Crew. Wren was referencing Brandon Laatsch (timestamped link to clip [0])
| "Shower thoughts only work, when you put in the work." You have to actually spend time trying to brainstorm something, trying to think of something, and at the end of it you'll've made no progress and be discouraged. But then randomly, later, in the shower, doing something completely unrelated, the idea hits.
It's weird, but I think it works. My best guess is that (part of this can be explained that) by spending time thinking about the solution space, your brain will then subconsciously start to generalize. Which would mean this is, to some extent, a trainable skill. I'm sure Churchill was also a master of moving conversations to topics or subtopics where he could more quickly make off-the-cuff remarks. But I think even the "slowest" person will recognize that they are much quicker in certain categories. Slowness might not mean they lack having thought about those topics, but might just mean they've thought less about quip remarks in that domain (or even quip remarks in general).I think we would be naive to assume quick responses are a good measure of one's intelligence[1]. I know this is common, but I think it is missing the same thing that quick responses also tend to miss: depth. You can be fast and deep, but more often people are fast and wrong[2]. More complex the topic the easier it is to be unaware of how wrong.[0] https://youtu.be/9FL7IZavt1I?t=93[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45242293[2] https://0x0.st/KcAU.pngreplyefsavage 4 minutes ago

I am also the slow-thinking dev married to a quick thinker, and it's a good pairing.
I know couples where they're both quick thinkers and things are so mercurial it's hard to believe they're still together, but maybe the excitement keeps it going.I enjoy watching Harry Mack videos on YouTube where he freestyles and can work in something that happens like someone walking into the frame into literally the next line of his raps.

I also often don’t have timely responses.There are sometimes long pauses before my response or even mid-speech, during which I’m thinking about what’s said. But the delay is often interpreted as a cue for someone else to respond or change the subject, which often leads to not being able to say anything that i’ve spent so much glutamate to process.I used to say “one moment” every 5 seconds while I think, but that was distracting.Sometimes, I do this thing with my eyes jumping them around as if I’m reading a book; that gives people something to look at while they wait, like a spinner indicator.replyozgrakkurt 2 hours ago

>I guess if you take a long time to do something, people kind of forget that you're there.This is so true sadly, group conversations are very exhausting to me. It is a constant back-and-forth and if you want to say something you need to do it "quick" or the topic shifts.>Also, my ‘processing time’ in conversation is slow. So I’ve realised that I’m better off focusing on writing as a way to communicate. Writing to me feels more suited towards slow, patient thinkers.I feel the same way, I try to avoid arguments (like something political with friends (harmless, don't worry)) because it takes me too long to say what I want to say, and my sentences jump around awkwardly trying to express the point I want to make. I was also made fun of in school due to that... Also I tend to mispronounce some words then which makes it even more awkward. People often think that if you don't respond to an argument in two seconds you "lose"...This also got waaay worse when I first drifted into burnout two years ago (still have, not recovered).replysquigz 2 minutes ago

These are symptoms of other people being unable - and/or unwilling -
to communicate properly, not you communicating slowly. If people actually cared about having a real back-and-forth conversation - and not just waiting for their time to speak - then a friend talking a bit slowly or jumping around trying to get their point across wouldn't be an issue.

Oh for sure. Ask questions, just not annoying whiteboard questions. Also I hate this “ask us anything” part of the interview. It’s so performative.It should be rephrased as “the jeopardy round” since it’s still about the candidate, but phrased backwards. And it’s not a time for REAL questions, it’s a time to show you’re smart and attentive but not TOO smart, you want the interviewer to feel good about themselves so they can feel good about you.> what my response would beI don’t ask candidates to do anything I wouldn’t put up with. It would be unusual but I would be game (if they were serious). Fundamentally that’s what my fantasy is about: a world where interviewer and interviewee have mutual respect for each other.In the recent past I’ve asked candidates to walk me through code they’ve written.

Sure, interviews go both ways, but there’s a major difference in what each side wants from the other. The company wants someone who can deliver software and architecture, which requires substantial vetting.

The pay question is valid, but not appropriate for a technical interview. If someone asked me I wouldn’t even know the answer.

Me too, the hard part is showing that this slower, more methodical process is more valuable than the flashy, quick shallow approach.

You may have ADHD. I’ve never described myself as dim-witted, because I’ve never viewed it so negatively, but your description fits me exactly. Even down to the spatial awareness thing and biographical details like switching from math to theoretical physics in college.I eventually got diagnosed as an adult with ADHD, and got treatment. Stimulants help me be significantly more “quick-witted” to use your terms. I would rather describe “being slow” as being in a constant state of distraction, which prevents me from being efficient with the task at hand. Stimulants fix this.However having grown up scatterbrained, some aspects of it are now architectural in my brain and aren’t changed by slightly modifying the brain chemistry. I now see that as a superpower through, as it gives me a different perspective for seeing problems, and is great for strategic thinking. Stimulants just give me focused control over it and the ability to turn it off and on as the need arises.replytptacek 4 hours ago

Everyone is on their own journey and there are so many reasons a person might think a particular way.The comment you are responding to is just trying to explain their own situation and say the person who wrote the article might want to investigate a similar experience compared to their own. I read the article as one where someone is exploring and ADHD is would be exploration. I would specify that ADHD inattentive type is the one that it reads most like to me.I don't see why you'd want to knock someone's choice of treatment for a particular condition. You might not see a need for a particular treatment option, but many folks get relief from anxiety or other things such as RSD while being medicated for ADHD.

This is an astute point. I’m a mid-40s mech engineer in the Bay Area. HN is my tribe, by and large. I’ve been bombarded with perspectives that ADHD medication is the answer.

> why wouldn't we just look at this and say "this is a normal way for a human being to operate" and refuse to pathologize itI don't think it's so much about that... it's more that having a label for a common set of behaviors/symptoms can be a shorthand to explain things more succinctly.Btw, would you say the same thing about clinical depression? Why/why not?> Why drug your way to a different thinking style?Because ADHD (and other things) can be crippling when it comes to actually getting IRL shit that needs doing... done. "We live in a society" is a meme, but there's actually a lot of stuff that can present non-trivial hurdles for neuro-divergent people IRL ... like filing taxes, going to an unemployment office, etc. etc.(Also, that's not quite what the drugs do if you have ADHD, but I digress)replyidiotsecant 3 hours ago

I think I wouldn't be so quick to conclude ADHD or suggest stimulants. I have ADHD too, and I know exactly what you're talking about. Those alarms in your head going off. Where everything is an emergency so nothing is. I'm not so sure it is being "scatterbrained" as much as it is over-parallelism.But the OP's points have more complexity than they think (in my main comment[0] I mention depth being missing). Let's take the quick math one for example. They made the assumption that a calculation was being made. This seems reasonable, but if you're doing a lot of those calculations you'll memorize them. I interestingly have experimental data on this. After my undergrad I had to get an EKG done and the tech asked me to do some basic math questions to get some readings. Problem is, I could answer her questions but she got almost no signal. They were just too easy for me because I was so familiar with them. You don't need to calculate what's in the cache. So we moved to 2 digit multiplications and signal was mixed. Good correlation with being able to leverage previous calculations. So then I had her and my dad pick 3 random numbers and I would multiply those in my head. That did the trick and she said it light up like a Christmas tree (I do this visually, so it really was using more parts of the brain than she was likely used to seeing).My point is, there's more nuance to this. Your brain isn't just a computation unit, it has various levels of storage with different speeds and capacities, it has different accelerators and processing units that can be leveraged if programmed in the right way. The problem with the OP's assessment is they've measured output speed and assumed this is enough information to calculate FLOPS, but a slower processor can win that race if it just is pulling from cache. A slower processor can win in aggregate if it has more parallelism. The problem is that they're measuring something different than what they think they're measuring, even if it is right up to a first order approximation.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45242293replythrowuxiytayq 3 hours ago

“May have” doesn’t indicate conclusion - you’re the one being quick. That said, the article really does seem to describe the symptoms of inattentive ADHD with a breadth of cues and close precision.As to the rest of your comment, not to diminish your experience, it’s really difficult to tell what you’re trying to say, and how that has to do with any of the very specific symptoms and experiences mentioned.replygodelski 1 hour ago

> “May have” doesn’t indicate conclusion
Correct. We are placing different likelihood values. Adastra gave reasons they'd consider an ADHD diagnosis. I game reasons to consider other interpretations. I didn't assume Adastra made a definitive 100% conclusion that OP has ADHD. Not only because I understand qualifying words but because making immutable conclusions is typically dumb and I don't think Adastra is dumb.
> it’s really difficult to tell what you’re trying to say, and how that has to do with any of the very specific symptoms and experiences mentioned.
Look back to my comment and skip to the "My point is" paragraph. If you haven't read the article, I would do that first, because I am picking a specific example from the article. In fact, the main example. They talk quite a bit about doing calculations quickly, including our 3 digit by 3 digit multiplication. Speed isn't enough because you can't distinguish between someone's raw calculation capabilities from use of a different algorithm. In my story I heavily implied I was using a different algorithm to do my calculations, and you bet I was leveraging the reuse of subcalculations.My comment is saying "I think it is more likely that OP is comparing apples to oranges. They assume they're interchangeable because they're both roundish fruits, but if you're interested in health benefits then you need to consider additional aspects." It's just longer because I'm specifying aspects and providing an example.replybarrkel 32 minutes ago

I find myself bimodal, when comparing my "speed" to others in social situations.If there's something that's novel to me, I feel like I'm slower than the average bear. Not massively slower, but with a desire to take the material aside and spend some time alone with it.But if it's my home ground, if I've been living inside it, I find few people can keep up with me.At least part of it is that social interaction takes a bit more processing power. I know I get a bit autistic and info dumpy when I know the ground, and that relieves the social pressure (though I know it costs me points too).replyDavidWoof 57 minutes ago

JoelOnSoftware had a great piece back in the day where he mentioned that while he consciously knew what a short sale on an option was, in practice he had to stop and think about how to calculate it, while his financial friends just knew the answer immediately.
He drew a comparison to pointers in C, where if you're going to be a C programmer, then pointers should just be intuitively obvious to you and not something you need to think about.IAW, there are no pure fast or slow thinkers, a lot of this is just how well have you internalized the background material.
Having quick repartee in conversation has absolutely no relationship to immediately seeing what the loop variable should be in a programming problem.
FizzBuzz isn't quickly solved by decent devs because they think faster, it's quickly solved because it's a trivial problem that doesn't require serious thinking for experienced devs.When I'm programming for finance or medical, I often have to tell the PM "let's stop here and let me think about this for a day".
Because it's not my field, it takes me a while to get my head around it.

This absolutely resonates with me.I have always felt that my verbal recall skills and the size of my lexicon do not correspond strongly to the quality of my ideas.Which is unfortunate because I believe most people over-index on these attributes. folks with extremely high wit and low/average critical thinking, I.e Russel Brand types are extremely persuasive due to their ability to be so _accurate_. But accuracy doesn't matter if you're not shooting at the right target. We confuse accuracy with truthfulness. It is some sort of cognitive fallacy our brains short circuit to.The best folks in our position can do is find work that allows our results to speak for us. And yes, write. Find the time to write.

I believe I'm a slow thinker too and it's always bothered me that in a work context there's an inherent advantage for fast thinkers due to the idea that the optimal way to solve problems is to "just jump on a call/huddle" or hash it out in a meeting.

I went through an autism assessment about a year ago. Part of that was getting an IQ test. I scored well in Verbal Comprehension and Perceptual Reasoning, but struggled more in Processing Speed. This was accounted for by giving two scores, the Full Scale IQ, and the General Ability Index (GAI). The GAI deemphasizes the processing speed, as raw speed to an answer usually isn't that important these days. I was told the having a larger gap between these numbers is one indication that autism might be in the picture.replydrbojingle 27 minutes ago

At times I've thought I was fundamentally deficient in some way, only to realize later that I was catastrophising about a poor performance in something and generalizing that across my entire life.There is also a lot of variation in our abilities, mostly due to practice.

It affects how I perform in coding interviews, and I also need to work around it in my job.I also have ADHD and a lot of this matches Dr Russell A Barkley's description of ADHD, particularly when he describes it as a performance and executive function disorder - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzBixSjmbc8eFl6UX5_wW.... ADHD includes much more but this "slow thinking" seems to be a prominent feature.replygodelski 4 hours ago

I think it can be an error labeling people as "fast" or "slow". I had similar self doubts to the OP during my PhD, where so many people around me would say they "got" a concept and I was just feeling behind. But a few years in, while desperately trying to "catch up" I realized a good portion of the time I was just misinterpreting. Even those tasks aren't as well defined as the OP suggests.There's another dimension that often is not acknowledged: depth. People have different thresholds at where they're comfortable talking about a topic or saying they "understand". I also don't think there's a strong correlation with the person's intelligence, if anything, a slight bias towards "slower" people being smarter.
- Dumb people might have low thresholds as they are unaware of depth.
- Smart people will have low thresholds because they do better thinking out loud or are just saying they think they have enough to launch off of.
- Dumb people might be slow because they haven't thought about the thing very much.
- Smart people might be slow because they are considering different depths.
You'd never judge how fast someone can run without stating the distance. Your 100m sprint time isn't going to tell us much about your 400m time nor your marathon time, and vise versa.We all think fast and slow at times (intended), and we're all 4 people in the above list on different topics. I think we should just make sure we're judging people at the right race. The trouble is despite standing in front of you, talking face to face, you don't know if in that time they've run a few meters or a few kilometers. I think we'd all do better if we worried a little less about speed. If your destination is nowhere, you get there in the same time regardless of your speed.replypavement_sort 1 hour ago

I've personally found that the time taken to think through a discussion is akin to an inverse guassian curve:- on the left tail are people who know little-to-nothing about (or have little experience with) the given topic and neeed a chunk of time- then as knowledge and experience increases, less time is needed, eventually peaking out at what appears to be instance understanding + ability to communcate effectively about it- but then something interesting happens when they get even more experience + knowledge: they now know about all the edge cases, things that go wrong, etc. and once again take more time to think through the topicI've also found that most everyone is the same in this regard. Every once in a while (like any normal distribution) there's an outlier on one side of the spectrum or the other, but for the most part, everyone is the same.Where people tend to differ is in their coping skills in such situations. Early in my career I had to learn to ask people to explain their thinking. Later it was me slowing down and realizing there's likely more to it than I think (and for those behind me).Now it's me telling those at the peak of the curve to slow down, because while they may be right, and -maybe- they've thought it through, that's probably not the case.TL;DR to anyone who thinks they are a slow thinker - you probably aren't (like imposter syndrome), and just need to learn to slow the room down. Doing so will help you, others behind you, and those in front of you.replyleoh 20 minutes ago

I've been thinking about something related lately.I've been going through algorithms problems and although I've been a very successful engineer, I feel terrible when solving algorithms problems.I had a realization, which is that there are two ways to learn:1. trying to figure out solutions a priori2. learning from tutorials online or cormen, rivest, stein, etc.The two approaches are very difficult for me to reconcile. I'm the type of person that always prefers to do (1). That said, a lot of algorithms probably either1. took a lot of careful studying to figure out2. were solved by someone who is really brilliant3. some combination of (1) and (2)I think we need to remember that in all likelihood, many "solved" problems in technical fields -- which individuals are expected to be able to solve, at least in programming interviews -- probably were solved in the past by taking a lot of careful time by reasonably smart (but not necessarily genius individuals -- though I am sure there are exceptions).I would much prefer to be able to do (1) for every algorithms problem, but the fact of it is, I think it is near impossible (probably even for very brilliant individuals, maybe folks like Ramanujan excepted -- and even then, he had exposure to building blocks in textbooks).Calculus is a special case of this, for example. It doubtless took Newton and Leibniz a lot of very careful studying to discover calculus in addition to them being very bright individuals.Solving a rubik's cube is another example. I suspect (though am not sure) that the the number of individuals who have solved a rubik's cube a priori is extremely tiny. Maybe on the order of dozens (out of hundreds of thousands if not millions?) in the world ever.I don't think that these issues are clearly articulated enough and it really is a shame.It's also a tragedy, I think, that we live in a world where:1. individuals working in technical fields are often expected to be able to know how to do a lot of very hard things that likely took humanity a very very long time to discover2. there is a tremendous amount of pressure in many contexts to know how to do very hard things in many cases without very much support in learningFor individuals that don't care too much about figuring things out a priori, I think this can be a very very challenging world.I think one of the ways out is to appreciate the above -- and to carefully, slowly, thoughtfully attempt to reconcile when to try to understand things a priori versus when to try to learn things from principles others have discovered.The first individuals who were doing things like sorting algorithms, dynamic programming, etc. likely took months if not years to be able to solve problems that are now considered (relatively) trivial and in only a few lines of code.replybirdfood 9 minutes ago

I think a good, related example to your point is the “2 watched literals” algorithm used in SAT solvers. It uses lazy evaluation to significantly improve the speed of the SAT solver. I implemented an SAT solver a couple of years ago just for learning and when it came to refactoring my code to implement the 2 watched literal I had what felt like a moment of recognition of the cumulative time and effort of many people working in this field of research that it must have taken to arrive at this design. It’s just such an elegant implementation that to me seems it can only have come from deeply understanding the theory and implementation of SAT solvers.replyednite 4 hours ago

Lots of undiagnosed autistic people in the comments describing autistic masking and burnout.Autistic burnout is the name for the unexplainable energy drain when you have to interact with people, because while social interactions are usually as effortless and as easy as lifting a finger for neurotypical people, they can feel like lifting a 100lbs stone for you, because you have to constantly remember how to act and at the same time focus on the moment to not miss a social cue, etc. This is called masking and it drains your energy.Now watch people under this comment claiming they are not autistic, because how they are able to perfectly socialize, because they have learned to keep eye contact by putting a reminder on a post-it note on their desk for a year in the middle school.Before discovering I'm autistic I was totally dumbfounded: why I was tired as if I ran a marathon after a meetup with friends for just a few hours?

Does it? Some of the words are the same but I think they refer to different things.

The author is saying in many situations he is applying type 2 thinking when he should be applying type 1.
His volleyball experience for example.The book discusses this. Albeit for most people the problem is the reverse. They are applying type 1 thinking to situations that require type 2.replyleoc 3 hours ago

i think it just doesn’t matter much.answering a question in 30 seconds vs. 5 minutes of thought is a very salient distinction in school and in some job interviews. it can impress people. so it feels painful to be slow.all else equal you’d rather be quick. but it’s only a very small advantage for doing most real work.replyaatd86 1 hour ago

I write about doing high-risk, impactful and neglected science. Particularly in physics, biophysics and biosecurity. Ex-Cambridge Maths. Ex-Goldman. Currently at hedge fund but no finance content here.Judging by this person's bio, I am sure he is not actually slow, at least not as defined by IQ. You don't land those jobs
and credentials by being slow. Getting a quant job for example requires being able to think fast on one's feet to answer interview questions.I think it's more like his working memory speed is not up to his satisfaction or subjectively he feels slow, but relative to everyone else or general population, he is not actually slow, much in the same way a runway model may feel fat due to body dysmorphia, but is not actually fat.My first real struggle with slow processing time was when I started to play competitive volleyball in high school.the vast majority of people who try a
sport will suck at it, and many are still bad even with practice, hence why so few become pro. it has nothing to do with mental slowness.It's like when Einstein felt he was bad at physics or math. No, he was brilliant at it, but he thought he was not good enough to solve
the problem he wanted to solve, which had also vexed everyone else too.replyb_e_n_t_o_n 3 hours ago

In my experience, barring actual disability, those who think "slowly" are often just deeper thinkers.The ability to think very quickly isn't necessarily better, often it's just the ability to care so little about the consequences that you pick a lane quickly and go with it.And I say this as someone who is a quick thinker and have trouble focusing for extended time...replyRazengan 1 hour ago

I'm going to propose an alternative explanation. This distinction doesn't exist, or at least not the way it seems.The "fast thinkers" aren't thinking. They're just doing. Everyone is not only capable of this, but probably behave this way several times a day on certain tasks without realizing it or how it seems to others.This is beyond mere practice towards a narrow goal. Certain topics just click better due to seemingly unrelated, yet deeply integrated life experiences.It's not something to worry about since, as the article states, it doesn't affect outcomes much. If anything, "fast thinking" creates blind spots.replymore_corn 2 hours ago

My observation is that people mostly think at the same speed
but some are happy thinking less before they draw conclusions. This often comes across as a skill or being smarter (to be fair it's a legit skill whether you agree with the results it delivers). I find a lot of business and management consulting is like this, people happily jump to the closest pattern whether or not it fits in order to avoid thinking and appear clever, and there's very little appetite to actually think deeply about something because whatever you do will need to be run by other people who don't want to think...replyvoidhorse 58 minutes ago
