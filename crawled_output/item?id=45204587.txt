I also thought about this a lot. Some things about slow thinking are great. I truly believe that it helped me thrive as a software developer.But social interactions are awkward. I can't really come up with things to say easily and lots of times I can't respond in ways to keep the conversation going. Only after the fact I get lots of ideas of what I could have said. I'm truly impressed about others who can just come up with interesting or funny things to say on the spot.I'm a tad older, so I stopped caring about it and just accepted my slow thinking. But I'm sure that I also missed out on a lot of opportunities regarding friendships or work. I still think, that others perceive me as awkward or just not fun and it's hard to just ignore that.Funnily my wife is completely opposite to me and we have the greatest time.replySwizec 1 hour ago

> I'm truly impressed about others who can just come up with interesting or funny things to say on the spot.As Winston Churchill once said when asked “what are you doing” –> “Oh just preparing my off-the-cuff remarks for tomorrow”I’m one of those weirdos who does public speaking sometimes. Even 8 hour workshops. You cannot prepare for an 8 hour speaking engagement. Not really. But you can accumulate a plethora of anecdotes, metaphors, and remarks that you weave into the narrative or in response to questions.You can build frameworks that are similar to code. Prepared functions/coroutines/objects that you run in appropriate situations. Works pretty well especially in mentoring/teaching/consulting situations. This is also how comedians prep their sets.The key is that things you say are new to the audience, but not to you. It can be the same metaphor you’ve fine-tuned over dozens of interactions. And the person you’re talking to thinks “Wow that guy is so quick on his feet, how did he come up with that so fast!?”You can also spot this if you watch talks by popular presenters (Simon Sinek is a good example). You’ll notice the same 2 or 3 core stories getting polished and fine-tuned over years of talks and interviews.replysaghm 1 hour ago

When I was super young, I used to think my dad (who everyone I met seemed to think was extremely funny) had a huge repitoire of hilarious stories, but after a few years I noticed him repeating them and realized he just had a few specific ones that he would re-use with new people, like you mentioned. As someone who tends to be pretty slow to learn how to navigate new social situations, it was eye-opening when I recognized this was something I could do. What's amusing to me at this point is that I'm still not sure he fully realizes that this is something he does sometimes, because he'll still sometimes try to whip out one of the stories when talking to me and then genuinely be surprised when I remind him of some very minor detail about it that he forgot to mention this time he told it.replynoir_lord 2 hours ago

To an extent it’s a skill you can practice if not learn.By nature I’m a slow thinker but I can mode switch if I need to but it’s exhausting after a while in a weird way I put it down to working in the trades before switching to programming full time, some of the fastest funniest people you’ll ever meet are tradesmen on job sites (introversion doesn’t mean poor social skills after all though they get conflated).If you are generally happy as you are don’t sweat it, be a boring world if we where all the same.replyKiboneu 1 hour ago

I also often don’t have timely responses.There are sometimes long pauses before my response or even mid-speech, during which I’m thinking about what’s said. But the delay is often interpreted as a cue for someone else to respond or change the subject, which often leads to not being able to say anything that i’ve spent so much glutamate to process.I used to say “one moment” every 5 seconds while I think, but that was distracting.Sometimes, I do this thing with my eyes jumping them around as if I’m reading a book; that gives people something to look at while they wait, like a spinner indicator.replyozgrakkurt 1 hour ago

>I guess if you take a long time to do something, people kind of forget that you're there.This is so true sadly, group conversations are very exhausting to me. It is a constant back-and-forth and if you want to say something you need to do it "quick" or the topic shifts.>Also, my ‘processing time’ in conversation is slow. So I’ve realised that I’m better off focusing on writing as a way to communicate. Writing to me feels more suited towards slow, patient thinkers.I feel the same way, I try to avoid arguments (like something political with friends (harmless, don't worry)) because it takes me too long to say what I want to say, and my sentences jump around awkwardly trying to express the point I want to make. I was also made fun of in school due to that... Also I tend to mispronounce some words then which makes it even more awkward. People often think that if you don't respond to an argument in two seconds you "lose"...This also got waaay worse when I first drifted into burnout two years ago (still have, not recovered).replynuancebydefault 2 hours ago

My observation is that people mostly think at the same speed
but some are happy thinking less before they draw conclusions. This often comes across as a skill or being smarter (to be fair it's a legit skill whether you agree with the results it delivers). I find a lot of business and management consulting is like this, people happily jump to the closest pattern whether or not it fits in order to avoid thinking and appear clever, and there's very little appetite to actually think deeply about something because whatever you do will need to be run by other people who don't want to think...replyadastra22 3 hours ago

You may have ADHD. I’ve never described myself as dim-witted, because I’ve never viewed it so negatively, but your description fits me exactly. Even down to the spatial awareness thing and biographical details like switching from math to theoretical physics in college.I eventually got diagnosed as an adult with ADHD, and got treatment. Stimulants help me be significantly more “quick-witted” to use your terms. I would rather describe “being slow” as being in a constant state of distraction, which prevents me from being efficient with the task at hand. Stimulants fix this.However having grown up scatterbrained, some aspects of it are now architectural in my brain and aren’t changed by slightly modifying the brain chemistry. I now see that as a superpower through, as it gives me a different perspective for seeing problems, and is great for strategic thinking. Stimulants just give me focused control over it and the ability to turn it off and on as the need arises.replytptacek 3 hours ago

Given the whole point of the article is that this person's thinking style isn't dysfunctional, in fact seems to be working out just fine for them, why wouldn't we just look at this and say "this is a normal way for a human being to operate" and refuse to pathologize it?

Everyone is on their own journey and there are so many reasons a person might think a particular way.The comment you are responding to is just trying to explain their own situation and say the person who wrote the article might want to investigate a similar experience compared to their own. I read the article as one where someone is exploring and ADHD is would be exploration. I would specify that ADHD inattentive type is the one that it reads most like to me.I don't see why you'd want to knock someone's choice of treatment for a particular condition. You might not see a need for a particular treatment option, but many folks get relief from anxiety or other things such as RSD while being medicated for ADHD. They can make their own decisions.replyfreetinker 35 minutes ago

This is an astute point. I’m a mid-40s mech engineer in the Bay Area. HN is my tribe, by and large. I’ve been bombarded with perspectives that ADHD medication is the answer. (Not officially diagnosed, but I’m confident I meet the criteria and very likely “afflicted.”)The brain is complex—adapted, or maladapted, for different tasks. My working hypothesis: mine is maladapted to the behaviors currently rewarded in corporate America. And I know I’m not Feynman.So here I am, stuck in a bi-modal world (or maybe just worldview).

> why wouldn't we just look at this and say "this is a normal way for a human being to operate" and refuse to pathologize itI don't think it's so much about that... it's more that having a label for a common set of behaviors/symptoms can be a shorthand to explain things more succinctly.Btw, would you say the same thing about clinical depression? Why/why not?> Why drug your way to a different thinking style?Because ADHD (and other things) can be crippling when it comes to actually getting IRL shit that needs doing... done. "We live in a society" is a meme, but there's actually a lot of stuff that can present non-trivial hurdles for neuro-divergent people IRL ... like filing taxes, going to an unemployment office, etc. etc.(Also, that's not quite what the drugs do if you have ADHD, but I digress)replygodelski 2 hours ago

I think I wouldn't be so quick to conclude ADHD or suggest stimulants. I have ADHD too, and I know exactly what you're talking about. Those alarms in your head going off. Where everything is an emergency so nothing is. I'm not so sure it is being "scatterbrained" as much as it is over-parallelism.But the OP's points have more complexity than they think (in my main comment[0] I mention depth being missing). Let's take the quick math one for example. They made the assumption that a calculation was being made. This seems reasonable, but if you're doing a lot of those calculations you'll memorize them. I interestingly have experimental data on this. After my undergrad I had to get an EKG done and the tech asked me to do some basic math questions to get some readings. Problem is, I could answer her questions but she got almost no signal. They were just too easy for me because I was so familiar with them. You don't need to calculate what's in the cache. So we moved to 2 digit multiplications and signal was mixed. Good correlation with being able to leverage previous calculations. So then I had her and my dad pick 3 random numbers and I would multiply those in my head. That did the trick and she said it light up like a Christmas tree (I do this visually, so it really was using more parts of the brain than she was likely used to seeing).My point is, there's more nuance to this. Your brain isn't just a computation unit, it has various levels of storage with different speeds and capacities, it has different accelerators and processing units that can be leveraged if programmed in the right way. The problem with the OP's assessment is they've measured output speed and assumed this is enough information to calculate FLOPS, but a slower processor can win that race if it just is pulling from cache. A slower processor can win in aggregate if it has more parallelism. The problem is that they're measuring something different than what they think they're measuring, even if it is right up to a first order approximation.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45242293replythrowuxiytayq 2 hours ago

“May have” doesn’t indicate conclusion - you’re the one being quick. That said, the article really does seem to describe the symptoms of inattentive ADHD with a breadth of cues and close precision.As to the rest of your comment, not to diminish your experience, it’s really difficult to tell what you’re trying to say, and how that has to do with any of the very specific symptoms and experiences mentioned.replygodelski 21 minutes ago

> “May have” doesn’t indicate conclusion
Correct. We are placing different likelihood values. Adastra gave reasons they'd consider an ADHD diagnosis. I game reasons to consider other interpretations. I didn't assume Adastra made a definitive 100% conclusion that OP has ADHD. Not only because I understand qualifying words but because making immutable conclusions is typically dumb and I don't think Adastra is dumb.
> it’s really difficult to tell what you’re trying to say, and how that has to do with any of the very specific symptoms and experiences mentioned.
Look back to my comment and skip to the "My point is" paragraph. If you haven't read the article, I would do that first, because I am picking a specific example from the article. In fact, the main example. They talk quite a bit about doing calculations quickly, including our 3 digit by 3 digit multiplication. Speed isn't enough because you can't distinguish between someone's raw calculation capabilities from use of a different algorithm. In my story I heavily implied I was using a different algorithm to do my calculations, and you bet I was leveraging the reuse of subcalculations.My comment is saying "I think it is more likely that OP is comparing apples to oranges. They assume they're interchangeable because they're both roundish fruits, but if you're interested in health benefits then you need to consider additional aspects." It's just longer because I'm specifying aspects and providing an example.replyel_benhameen 3 hours ago

Oh for sure. Ask questions, just not annoying whiteboard questions. Also I hate this “ask us anything” part of the interview.

But accuracy doesn't matter if you're not shooting at the right target. We confuse accuracy with truthfulness.

I went through an autism assessment about a year ago. Part of that was getting an IQ test. I scored well in Verbal Comprehension and Perceptual Reasoning, but struggled more in Processing Speed. This was accounted for by giving two scores, the Full Scale IQ, and the General Ability Index (GAI). The GAI deemphasizes the processing speed, as raw speed to an answer usually isn't that important these days. I was told the having a larger gap between these numbers is one indication that autism might be in the picture.replykwakubiney 2 hours ago

I've personally found that the time taken to think through a discussion is akin to an inverse guassian curve:- on the left tail are people who know little-to-nothing about (or have little experience with) the given topic and neeed a chunk of time- then as knowledge and experience increases, less time is needed, eventually peaking out at what appears to be instance understanding + ability to communcate effectively about it- but then something interesting happens when they get even more experience + knowledge: they now know about all the edge cases, things that go wrong, etc. and once again take more time to think through the topicI've also found that most everyone is the same in this regard. Every once in a while (like any normal distribution) there's an outlier on one side of the spectrum or the other, but for the most part, everyone is the same.Where people tend to differ is in their coping skills in such situations. Early in my career I had to learn to ask people to explain their thinking. Later it was me slowing down and realizing there's likely more to it than I think (and for those behind me).Now it's me telling those at the peak of the curve to slow down, because while they may be right, and -maybe- they've thought it through, that's probably not the case.TL;DR to anyone who thinks they are a slow thinker - you probably aren't (like imposter syndrome), and just need to learn to slow the room down. Doing so will help you, others behind you, and those in front of you.replygodelski 3 hours ago

I think it can be an error labeling people as "fast" or "slow". I had similar self doubts to the OP during my PhD, where so many people around me would say they "got" a concept and I was just feeling behind. But a few years in, while desperately trying to "catch up" I realized a good portion of the time I was just misinterpreting. Even those tasks aren't as well defined as the OP suggests.There's another dimension that often is not acknowledged: depth. People have different thresholds at where they're comfortable talking about a topic or saying they "understand". I also don't think there's a strong correlation with the person's intelligence, if anything, a slight bias towards "slower" people being smarter.
- Dumb people might have low thresholds as they are unaware of depth.
- Smart people will have low thresholds because they do better thinking out loud or are just saying they think they have enough to launch off of.
- Dumb people might be slow because they haven't thought about the thing very much.
- Smart people might be slow because they are considering different depths.
You'd never judge how fast someone can run without stating the distance. Your 100m sprint time isn't going to tell us much about your 400m time nor your marathon time, and vise versa.We all think fast and slow at times (intended), and we're all 4 people in the above list on different topics. I think we should just make sure we're judging people at the right race. The trouble is despite standing in front of you, talking face to face, you don't know if in that time they've run a few meters or a few kilometers. I think we'd all do better if we worried a little less about speed. If your destination is nowhere, you get there in the same time regardless of your speed.replypavement_sort 37 minutes ago

I write about doing high-risk, impactful and neglected science. Particularly in physics, biophysics and biosecurity. Ex-Cambridge Maths. Ex-Goldman. Currently at hedge fund but no finance content here.Judging by this person's bio, I am sure he is not actually slow, at least not as defined by IQ. You don't land those jobs
and credentials by being slow. Getting a quant job for example requires being able to think fast on one's feet to answer interview questions.I think it's more like his working memory speed is not up to his satisfaction or subjectively he feels slow, but relative to everyone else or general population, he is not actually slow, much in the same way a runway model may feel fat due to body dysmorphia, but is not actually fat.My first real struggle with slow processing time was when I started to play competitive volleyball in high school.the vast majority of people who try a
sport will suck at it, and many are still bad even with practice, hence why so few become pro. it has nothing to do with mental slowness.It's like when Einstein felt he was bad at physics or math. No, he was brilliant at it, but he thought he was not good enough to solve
the problem he wanted to solve, which had also vexed everyone else too.replyb_e_n_t_o_n 2 hours ago

Yeah this article kind of feels like an NBA benchwarmer complaining how unathletic they are, despite being more athletic than 99.99% of the population.replyrawgabbit 4 hours ago

Does it? Some of the words are the same but I think they refer to different things. The author of the article is talking about processing speed for tasks that belong in Kahneman's slow system 2, not about some personal preference/aptitude for slow over fast the way Kahneman means it.replyrawgabbit 2 hours ago

The author is saying in many situations he is applying type 2 thinking when he should be applying type 1.
His volleyball experience for example.The book discusses this. Albeit for most people the problem is the reverse. They are applying type 1 thinking to situations that require type 2.replyleoc 2 hours ago

Not exclusively: playing volleyball is surely a ‘thinking fast’ situation, for instance.replyAerbil313 1 hour ago

Lots of undiagnosed autistic people in the comments describing autistic masking and burnout.Autistic burnout is the name for the unexplainable energy drain when you have to interact with people, because while social interactions are usually as effortless and as easy as lifting a finger for neurotypical people, they can feel like lifting a 100lbs stone for you, because you have to constantly remember how to act and at the same time focus on the moment to not miss a social cue, etc. This is called masking and it drains your energy.Now watch people under this comment claiming they are not autistic, because how they are able to perfectly socialize, because they have learned to keep eye contact by putting a reminder on a post-it note on their desk for a year in the middle school.Before discovering I'm autistic I was totally dumbfounded: why I was tired as if I ran a marathon after a meetup with friends for just a few hours? Now I know.replysublinear 2 hours ago

I'm going to propose an alternative explanation. This distinction doesn't exist, or at least not the way it seems.The "fast thinkers" aren't thinking. They're just doing. Everyone is not only capable of this, but probably behave this way several times a day on certain tasks without realizing it or how it seems to others.This is beyond mere practice towards a narrow goal. Certain topics just click better due to seemingly unrelated, yet deeply integrated life experiences.It's not something to worry about since, as the article states, it doesn't affect outcomes much. If anything, "fast thinking" creates blind spots.replymore_corn 1 hour ago

Now take your time. Most of the important thoughts in life are ones you can take your time with. It’s all good as long as you get there eventually.In fact we might all be slow thinkers. Wisdom might mean thinking slowly and carefully, with acknowledgment of as many external factors as possible.Heck that might be what life is about, getting to the highest possible point of wisdom even if it takes a long time.replysome_furry 3 hours ago

> Over time, I’ve noticed that my friends, split between the ‘quick-witted people’, and the ‘non quick-witted people’ seem to have similar levels of achievement. This is really a comment about distributions. If you select a skill, like math or career or whatever, and look at distribution quick-witted people vs the slow-witted people, then it appears that those distributions actually overlap.Are you familiar with System 1 and System 2?https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/system...replythe_arun 2 hours ago

> those with a slower processing time somehow compensating with other qualities.Does not list those other qualities.Reality is that some people are better and some are worse. No need to make half assed excuses about that.replythrowuxiytayq 2 hours ago

You could put effort into, first, considering what to think. Which does not necessarily involve thinking. And maybe your're quicker at that.reply
