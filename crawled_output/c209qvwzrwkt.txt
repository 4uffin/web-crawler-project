City have had just one, yes one shot on target in the opening 40 minutes.Simply not good enough for a side with so much attacking quality.

Good news for Arsenal because Beth Mead is OK to continue. Four minutes to go until the break and West Ham will be delighted if they can get in level.

From a Brighton perspective Vidosic will be absolutely delighted with how his team played. They went out, pressed, got the goal. They created more chances and stuck their bodies on the line when needed. For Man City it's about taking chances. Same old story, not clinical enough.

City keeper Khiara Keating mixes it up by playing long into the feet of Lauren Hemp in the Brighton half, she in turn tries to reverse it into the path of Vivianne Miedema but it just gets away from her.Nice idea though.

I'm surprised the Hammers managed to keep hold of Martinez after her form last season. It will be interesting to see if she does as well now that other teams know what she's about.Claire

Beth Mead is hurt after a tangle with Viviane Asseyi. Arsenal fans will be willing Mead to be fine as she has run the show so far tonight.

Brighton are not settling. They keep going, they want that second goal. Agyemang just can't quite get there, but the pressure is immense from Brighton.

The Brighton set piece comes to nothing but they recycle the play well and almost grab their second goal.Fran Kirby's looped cross to the back post is cushioned back into the middle by Marisa Olislagers but it drifts inches over the head of an unmarked Michelle Agyemang.That could and perhaps should have been 2-0 to the Seagulls.

Rehanne Skinner's key message at half-time will be that her players must find each other and they must keep the ball better. Realistically, the ball doesn't always have to go forward.I know they are trying to play on the counter-attack - and that's where Arsenal are quite vulnerable - but sometimes it's just the case of getting an extra pass, keeping the ball, calming things down and managing the game a bit.

Great tracking back from Imane Beney to intercept Michelle Agyemang's cut back to Fran Kirby. It'll cost a Brighton corner though.

Ah that should have been the equaliser.Lauren Hemp swings a sumptuous cross into Bunny Shaw at the back post but the Jamaican can't quite stretch her long legs far enough to direct the ball inside the back post.Image source, Getty Images

Just over half an hour in and City have not found a solution to Brighton's high press.They are not their normal fluid best on the ball and that's severely limiting them creating chances up the other end.

Katie McCabe is away down the left as Arsenal keep up the pressure but her ball towards the back post has too much on it.

Arsenal are definitely getting in West Ham's defensive third a lot more at the minute. The home team are just struggling to clear their lines a little bit.

The cameras have just panned to deadline day signing Grace Clinton, plus Mary Fowler and Rebecca Knaak sat watching in the stands. While City have a new man in the dugout, they seem to still have the same rotten luck with injury issues that they did last season.

West Ham need to be better when they are winning the ball back and it's also that final pass at the moment, isn't it? They are having to work really hard to get that ball off Arsenal but they are just panicking a little bit.The slightest bit of pressure and they are giving the ball away. They just aren't finding that quality with their final balls at the minute.

City are just upping the tempo now as they search for the equaliser.Lauren Hemp darts past Rachel McLauchlan and delivers a whipped ball towards the head of Vivianne Miedema but she can't sort out her feet quickly enough to apply the finishing touch.

It is all Arsenal now and it feels like only a matter of time before they take the lead here. Their short, sharp passing is proving difficult for West Ham to cope with.

Michelle Agyemang is sent running down to the left corner flag with Kerstin Casparij for company.Agyemang tries a shimmy too far in her bid to get into the box though and the Dutch full-back nicks it off her toes.

I just criticised Maanum as well, saying that she's not good, and then she shuts me up with a goal. I think I need to criticise someone else now!Sul, Birmingham
