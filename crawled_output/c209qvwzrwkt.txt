I'm just looking at Steph Catley and she just looks in a bit of distress here.She went to clear the ball and Viviane Asseyi just knocked her into the advertising boards.

West Ham are giving it a go now but there's only a couple of minutes of normal time remaining so unlikely they'll have the time to change the outcome.

We'll have six minutes of added time in Manchester.Feels a little excessive but then again we have seen both teams make a lot of changes.

Audacious attempt from Lauren Hemp who goes for the chip from around 30 yards with Chiamaka Nnadozie in no man's land.She gets too much on it though and it dips onto the roof of the Seagulls' net.

West Ham have their first corner - compare that to 10 for Arsenal - but the whistle goes for a foul as Katrina Gorry catches Olivia Smith.

City keeper Khiara Keating has been shakey with her feet tonight and she put her side's slender lead in jeopardy there.She tried to pass the ball out from on her own goal line but kicked it at Brighton forward Kiko Seike as she closed in.Thankfully for the hosts the deflection flies out of the danger zone rather than in the back of her own net.

Steph Catley has been excellent tonight.Katie Reid is still learning her trade, for example there have been a couple of times where she has been turned or made a step too high up and Catley has just covered for her so well.

A rare scramble in the Arsenal box and there's a shout of handball as a delivery into the box hits one of the visitors' players but nothing given.

Speaking of the City boss, he's made another changes. Naomi Layzell is on in place of Leila Ouahabi at left back.

When Andree Jeglertz was announced as the new City boss this summer, it made us wonder what his tactical approach would look like compared to the relentless side to side passing of predecessor Gareth Taylor.Well this attacking thirds map below demonstrates that Jeglertz favours wide play over central passing patterns - and to be fair is it any wonder when you've got the likes of Bunny Shaw who can pop up at the back post with sublime headers?Image source, Opta

Arsenal loanee Rosa Kafaji is on for her first minutes in a Brighton shirt this season as she replaces Madison Hayley.

The passing and movement from Arsenal is so quick, West Ham are just continually being dragged all over the place.

West Ham are going to have to do better with these Arsenal corners.They have a lot of zonal players so that short corner option is always going to be on at the minute and they are always going to be outnumbered in the box.

It's keep ball from City now.Having given her side the lead Yui Hasegawa has returned to her regular role of midfield metronome to dictate and slow the play to her team's liking.

Katie Reid has done really well tonight. She offers to receive all the time, no matter where she is and how much pressure she is under, which is the sign of a really confident player. She is obviously someone that Renee Slegers wants to develop and bring on.She is high up there for the most progressive passes in the game, that's really pleasing to see. That's what you want to see from your centre-backs, especially in such a ball-playing team like Arsenal.

I know it's early doors but that goal could prove huge for Man City's season.If they have any hope of keeping up with the runaway train that is Chelsea, they have to be winning tricky games like this.Image source, Getty Images

Man City dropped points in 9 of their 22 league games last year as they ended up finishing fourth, 17 points off eventual champions Chelsea.They can hardly afford to start this new season dropping points from each of their first two games.

West Ham have pretty much made straight substitutional swaps here.I'm interested to see if it will allow Riko Ueki to play a little higher, or even Viviane Asseyi.
