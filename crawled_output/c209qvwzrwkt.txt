I was confused about Lauren Hemp playing out on the right against Chelsea. She is one of the best left-wingers in world football and she has been for a number of years.She could've helped deal with the threat of Ellie Carpenter running up and down that wing, but Manchester City opted for young Lily Murphy on that side with Alex Greenwood. I felt they were quite exposed because of not having Hemp on that left-hand side.
