It's the best bang for the buck in the Meta glasses lineup. Even though it's $200 more than the Oakley's, the Display's tech chops are 3x better.@bozoid:   Zuck really wants everyone looking like a nerd with nervous fingers tbh, I really think this is way better than the AI glasses they've shown so far if you have deep pockets and go into trips often, this Ray-Ban glasses is a great companion with live translation, focus and allChris / @chatgpt21:   Glasses with Video display, AI, and a state of the art wrist tracker that you can you message people without speaking or barely moving your finger!  Are you not entertained?!?  I am once again reminding everyone if you were following me.  You would have known about the wrist tracker and heads up display coming at the beginning of this year!  😌Lauren Goode / @laurengoode:   I first wrote about a prototype version of the “neural band” 4 years ago for @WIRED (print!) after it mysteriously appeared in @boztank's timeline. At the time Meta said it might be 5 to 10 yrs before it was widely available. Meta has beat that timeline https://www.wired.com/...Drew Olanoff / @yoda:   i can't believe meta beat apple to these glasses. kudos to them.Mark Gurman / @markgurman:   I have a strong feeling these will be popular. I wonder if this will cause Apple to speed up its timeline. Right now, I'm not anticipating Apple glasses with displays for a few more years. Their first non-display model is likely being announced in late 26/early 27.Ben Bajarin / @benbajarin:   Aggressive entry price. Probably losing money but this is the price to try and go mainstream in AR smart glasses. [image]Hugo Barra / @hbarra:   I tried the new Meta Ray-Ban Display “Hypernova” glasses that Meta just announced (thanks for the demo @ahimel !)  TL;DR it's a really well-executed take on a simple idea: a crisp heads-up display with precise micro-gesture control of mini apps My quick takeaways from the demo I got: 1/ The monocular heads-up display (yup, Google Glass vibes!) is surprisingly usable despite “only” 20 deg FOV; pretty crisp and bright enough even in broad daylight; with enough space for fully functional widgets that are much bigger than anything you could fit on a watch display...@testingcatalog:   ...Did Zuck just kill the phone industry?  👀 Honestly, a wristband is a HUGE enabler, but there are significant questions about its quality.Ben Bajarin / @benbajarin:   I imagine a lot of interest in this. First wave will be the early adopters (which is me) but I think these flesh out the new use cases that build the foundation for this category.Sheel Mohnot / @pitdesi:   Rayban Meta Displays are fulfilling the original promise of Google Glass Society wasn't really ready for Google Glass tbh... now phones are out recording stuff all the time. $800, can do prescriptions too.

Gene Munster / @munster_gene:   Good news for $AAPL.  One take away from tonights $META keynote is hardware, software, AI integration is REALLY hard as evidence that two glasses demos struggled.  And they've poured energy into hardware.  Meta has lost/invested about $65B in Reality Labs since the name change in 2021.  Bottom line: Apple has more time to figure AI out than most realize.Sheel Mohnot / @pitdesi:   Remember when the iphone 4 demo failed and Steve Jobs told people in the audience to turn off their wifi? charming to look back [video]@jason:   Love it!

If these devices don't work for the dude who's learned to type 30 words per minute with his wrist what about the rest of us???Gene Munster / @munster_gene:   $META will get heat for the demo bombs. I applaud Zuck for “doing it live”. Bill O'Reilly must be proud.Alex Volkov / @altryne:   Do NOT bet against Zuck! What an incredible live demo to open Meta Connect, streaming right from the new glasses, showing the UI in the new in glasses display! 🔥 [video]Gene Munster / @munster_gene:   Shift to “Live AI” demo conks out.

@mingchikuo:   MacBook models will feature a touch panel for the first time, further blurring the line with the iPad.  This shift appears to reflect Apple's long-term observation of iPad user behavior, indicating that in certain scenarios, touch controls can enhance both productivity and the overall user experience.  1. The OLED MacBook Pro, expected to enter mass production by late 2026, will incorporate a touch panel using on-cell touch technology.  2. The more affordable MacBook model powered by an iPhone processor, slated for mass production in 4Q25, will not support a touch panel.  Specifications for its second-generation version, anticipated in 2027, remain under discussion and could include touch support.@mingchikuo:   Briefly looking back at the predictions I made on specs and details for Apple's new products—from several months to a little over a year ago—the vast majority have proven to be accurate or very close. 1. iPhone Air — Most of my calls were spot-on or very close, including designSami Fathi / @samifathi_:   Steve is currently rolling in his grave.Patrick Moorhead / @patrickmoorhead:   The Apple Fridge Toaster is finally here!Steven Sinofsky / @stevesi:   This would be pure insanity.
