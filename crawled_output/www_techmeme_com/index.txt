Failed demo but essentially flawless for users. I wish Apple would go back to live but I don't think it'll ever happen. Much more reach now and they definitely see taking risks for this type of thing as pointless (I don't think they're wrong).Mikaël Dufresne / @purplemikey:   Meta Connect 2025 was short, to the point and sincerely, impressive. It was not the best conference I have seen, but it covered things I am very interested in. Avatar in 3D VR is amazing. Hyperscape is a cool tech. Horizon worlds is making huge progress... And wearables too! [image]@basedbeffjezos:   We should reward innovation and risk taking with respect IMO. Too many mega corps playing it safe. Zuck is one of the few still in founder mode.@jasteinerman:   So here's the story behind why yesterdays live #metaconnect demo failed - when the chef said “Hey Meta start Live AI” it activated everyone's Meta AI in the room at once and effectively DDOS'd our servers 🤣 That's what we get for doing it live!@theo:   Hot take: Zuck handled this incredibly. Can't imagine how stressed the team must have been. He went out of his way to not put any additional pressure on them. When the lead came out, he consoled them and said “don't worry, we'll share a video of it soon” Great leadership 🫡Olivia Moore / @omooretweets:   Ancient tech wisdom says a failed live demo is a good omen for a killer product 🧘@basedbeffjezos:   If you watch the full video they actually nailed 4/5 features presented. Idk I was super impressed. If the stock dips temporarily it could be a good buying opportunity.Dylan Field / @zoink:   Congrats to the Meta team on today's launches!

It looks uncanny and fake because it is. They might as well just use AI.Dmitrii Kovanikov / @chshersh:   Firing people who made this product would be very wrong here.  In fact, it's a common pitfall managers in tech do: firing devs who make mistakes and hiring a brand new team.  You learn from mistakes.  New people don't have the context.  People who do know how to fix the shit and get better.  They will get better...Jim McPherson / @mcjamez:   @jasteinerman Is this copypasta that I'm not following? How can 10's of devices DDOS ~META's~ servers?Rohit / @krishnanrohit:   This feels quite bullish for Meta. I think they're close to cracking this. A HUD on glasses is something I'd buy in a heartbeat.Yuchen Jin / @yuchenj_uw:   Shit can happen during live demos. But that's better than shiny, staged videos, because it shows what real users might face. “The biggest risk is not taking any risk.” - Peter Thiel once told Zuck. Salute to those who dare to fail publicly and keep going.@benz145:   Two incredibly key things that Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses gets right: 1) The waveguide is very subtle.  You can notice the diagonal slats on the left side of the lens, but these are only one of two sets of gratings.  The other set is directly in front of the eye, but very hard to see. 2) The light-glow shining out from the display (ie: what other people would see when looking at you), is extremely minimal...Both of these are critical to social acceptability.  People who aren't up on the latest tech will probably have no idea there's anything special about the glasses when seeing them in passing, except that they're a little chunky.Gergely Orosz / @gergelyorosz:   Plus, as Meta's CTO, Boz explained: all AI traffic in the building was setup to route traffic to a dev server... routed via Iceland (from California!) Honestly props for Meta for doing a proper live demo. Makes me more interested in future demos, seeing it's no pre-recordedKristof / @zenfuturist:   I feel bad for Zuck and the Meta team :/ they swung for the fence with a live demo of some insane tech and it didn't work out. Meta is doing some insane stuff that doesn't get enough recognitionTJ Parker / @tjparker:   Meta execs are ~20 years younger than Apple's and still willing to do live demos.

@signulll:   did the administration think of the downstream effects of $100k h1b fee? let's maybe try mapping it out, shall we? the h1b tightening (or even just the perception that h1b is a dead end) potentially nukes the intl student pipeline. right now intl tuition is a subsidy engine.Yuchen Jin / @yuchenj_uw:   It's sad to hear President Trump raised the H-1B Visa fee from $1,000 to $100,000. - New grads will struggle to get a job - Startups can't afford global talent - Top minds will go to immigration-friendly countries to study and work US can't lose its biggest moat: global talentGlen E. McGregor / @glen_mcgregor:   Lutnick chimes in that the H1B visa fee will be $100,000 *every year* not a one-time application fee. This seems insane but massive opportunity for Canada to scoop up top engineering talent.Deedy / @deedydas:   🚨 Here's what Trump's executive order on the $100,000 H-1B ACTUALLY says: — It only applies to those entering the US — Effective Sep 21, 2025 and valid for 12 months — Decision on renewal of the EO will happen 30 days after the H-1B lottery — Says it's a one time payment. No [image]Christopher Mims / @mims:   I got A LOT of pushback when I wrote — in June — about how America's rejection of the world's best and brightest is leading to a “brain gain” for the rest of the world. But if this $100k fee on H-1B visas actually happens, expect that phenomenon to go into overdrive. [image]Daniel / @growing_daniel:   This keeps out the smart people from the third world that we should want here while restaurants and uber seem to have no problem getting tons of low skilled workers through chain migration etc. I'd understand curbing the program but this kills it.@powerbottomdad1:   indians panicking but the funny part is this will be clearly good for India right? stopping the brain drain I mean? they should be happyJeremy Neufeld / @jeremylneufeld:   I'm all for using auctions or fees to get H-1Bs to the best talent. But this won't be legal, has no price discovery, and risks driving down retention of STEM PhDs (are cap-exempt universities going to have to pay this?) [image]Deva Hazarika / @devahaz:   For 3 year visa, that's $33k/yr or 11% premium for 300k comp job. That doesn't seem crazy for hard to fill jobs. Feels like a win for big tech and finance companies, tough for smaller companies. Prob drives more outsourcing at lower levels.Scott Lincicome / @scottlincicome:   Given prior research on how R&D-intensive companies in the US respond to new limits on H1Bs (link/screenshot in next tweet), this EO should be called the “Offshoring Innovative US Industries Act of 2025”Aaron Reichlin-Melnick / @reichlinmelnick:   NEW: I got a copy of the H-1B proclamation. It's a 212(f) travel ban proclamation banning the entry into the US of H-1B visa holders who haven't paid the United States $100,000. It appears to go into effect IMMEDIATELY, despite the US having no system to accept such payments. [image]Sheel Mohnot / @pitdesi:   I initially thought the H-1B reform was reasonable but it's $100k per year, not per visa That is too much, will definitely have a negative effect on innovation in the US. It's basically only for people who make >$400k now. [video]Daniel Di Martino / @danieldimartino:   Adding a 100K fee to obtain an H-1B visa would end the program. It would be terrible for the U.S. economy, especially healthcare and STEM. Few if any firms will pay 100K to sponsor an immigrant on top of their salary. Thankfully, this is illegal. https://www.bloomberg.com/...Deedy / @deedydas:   Devastating immigration news! Trump to add $100k fee for H-1B visas. [image]@rapidresponse47:   .@POTUS signs a Proclamation to restrict the entry of certain H-1B aliens into the U.S. as nonimmigrant workers, requiring a $100,000 payment to accompany or supplement H-1B petitions for new applications. AMERICA FIRST! [video]Lee Fang / @lhfang:   Significant drop in stocks for Indian IT firms that dominate the H-1B visa field directly after the news the Trump admin will impose a $100k fee for the work visas [image]@usdol:   The days of employers abusing H-1B Visas are over. Introducing PROJECT FIREWALL—our plan to ensure high-skilled jobs go to AMERICANS FIRST 🇺🇸 [video]Esther Crawford / @esthercrawford:   Weird seeing people who are supposedly champions of startups and Little Tech cheer on the introduction of a $100k for H-1Bs given it'll immediately be cost prohibitive for early-stage startups to hire from that very talented pool. Big Tech can absorb the fees, startups can't.
