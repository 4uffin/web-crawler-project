Patrick Moorhead / @patrickmoorhead:   Huge deal between $NVDA and $INTC. NVIDIA and Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration across PC and datacenter and NVIDIA will invest $5B in Intel at $23.28 per share. The joint solution will be a tight coupling Intel x86 CPUs and NVIDIA RTX GPUs over NVLink for PCs [image]Lip-Bu Tan / @lipbutan1:   Excited to team up with my good friend Jensen to jointly develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products!  Our collaboration brings together the best of @Intel and @nvidia to benefit customers - and shows how vital x86 architecture and NVLink will be in shaping the future of AI infrastructure and personal computing.Ben Bajarin / @benbajarin:   In case anyone missed how the $NVDA + $INTC data center part will work.

[video]@metacriticcap:   $NVDA had lots of incentives to say they'd use Intel Foundry for something. NVIDIA, the company who used to double source between TSMC and SEC. But they didn't say that. They said they'll do lots of things with $INTC, but not that.Austin Lyons / @theaustinlyons:   $NVDA to invest $5 billion in $INTC! Press conference at 10am Pacific. Intel will also make x86 SoCs with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets for PCs and datacenter CPUs to connect with Nvidia accelerators via NVLink.Matthew Zeitlin / @mattzeitlin:   Another way of looking at this is that NVIDIA, which is entirely dependent on the federal government to access certain large export markets, put $5bn into a partially government owned company [image]Tom Warren / @tomwarren:   Nvidia is investing $5 billion into Intel to jointly develop PC and data center chips.

My thoughts on what matters below. (I like these more than long tweets). - Should ensure 14A happes since said Intel products will be 14A in this deal. - While NVIDIA GPU still made at TSMC this is packaged at Intel so some foundry dollars.

Learn more: https://newsroom.intel.com/... [image]Ben Bajarin / @benbajarin:   This is good for the whole of the semi industry. Jensen doesn't do this deal if there is doubt on Intel product roadmap (validates process roadmap) and likely leads to other customers using IFS for process and packaging. NVIDIA is to Intel what MSFT was to Apple in 1997.Cary Golomb / @carygolomb:   PC gaming handhelds with Intel+Nvidia APU will be very welcome. Goodness gracious!

Partnership Could Define and Accelerate the AI PC Landscape For Nvidia, developing its own Windows-on-ARM processors carries high uncertainty; for Intel, establishing a competitive edge in GPUs is difficult.Tim Culpan / @tculpan:   Watch out: AMD will buy a stake in Intel, in a similar deal to what Nvidia just announced. Apple is may also consider buying a stake. For the chip designers, it makes sense. Not for the investment thesis, but as protection money.Ben Bajarin / @benbajarin:   On $NVDA and $TSM. I'm not ready to make the leap that NViDIA will leave TSMC for manufacturing their GPUs on TSMC process. I CAN SEE, NVIDIA using $INTC more for packaging, and making the Arm CPU part where (for this product line) TSMC is only used for wafers/process.Tim Culpan / @tculpan:   ...yet Apple largely follows the same strategic thinking: keep the White House happy. Patrick McGee's Apple in China surely got attention in the administration, explaining what many in Washington already knew (but pretended not to) about Apple's role in strengthening the PRCDaniel Newman / @danielnewmanuv:   $INTC Foundry is likely to handle packaging for the new $NVDA / Intel product collaboration.Hamza Shaban / @hshaban:   Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel to co-develop chips in a surprise move that props up an ailing rival, Bloomberg reports Intel is getting another financial boost after the US agreed to take a ~10% stake, and the White House said it won't force companies to buy from Intel [image]Oren Cass / @oren_cass:   Good god, what does this even mean?

Failed demo but essentially flawless for users. I wish Apple would go back to live but I don't think it'll ever happen. Much more reach now and they definitely see taking risks for this type of thing as pointless (I don't think they're wrong).Mikaël Dufresne / @purplemikey:   Meta Connect 2025 was short, to the point and sincerely, impressive. It was not the best conference I have seen, but it covered things I am very interested in. Avatar in 3D VR is amazing. Hyperscape is a cool tech. Horizon worlds is making huge progress... And wearables too! [image]@basedbeffjezos:   We should reward innovation and risk taking with respect IMO. Too many mega corps playing it safe. Zuck is one of the few still in founder mode.@signulll:   meta raybans are incredibly insane tech, well done everyone working on them, you can feel the large amount of resources being put into them but... they're still also a *giant* social grenade.  simply because everyone in your social group always will always wonder if they're being recorded, which shifts social dynamics instantly.  it's like importing surveillance state into a dinner party...Rohit / @krishnanrohit:   This feels quite bullish for Meta. I think they're close to cracking this. A HUD on glasses is something I'd buy in a heartbeat.@theo:   Hot take: Zuck handled this incredibly. Can't imagine how stressed the team must have been. He went out of his way to not put any additional pressure on them. When the lead came out, he consoled them and said “don't worry, we'll share a video of it soon” Great leadership 🫡Yuchen Jin / @yuchenj_uw:   Shit can happen during live demos. But that's better than shiny, staged videos, because it shows what real users might face. “The biggest risk is not taking any risk.” - Peter Thiel once told Zuck. Salute to those who dare to fail publicly and keep going.Olivia Moore / @omooretweets:   Ancient tech wisdom says a failed live demo is a good omen for a killer product 🧘@basedbeffjezos:   If you watch the full video they actually nailed 4/5 features presented. Idk I was super impressed. If the stock dips temporarily it could be a good buying opportunity.@benz145:   Two incredibly key things that Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses gets right: 1) The waveguide is very subtle.  You can notice the diagonal slats on the left side of the lens, but these are only one of two sets of gratings.  The other set is directly in front of the eye, but very hard to see. 2) The light-glow shining out from the display (ie: what other people would see when looking at you), is extremely minimal...Both of these are critical to social acceptability.  People who aren't up on the latest tech will probably have no idea there's anything special about the glasses when seeing them in passing, except that they're a little chunky.Dylan Field / @zoink:   Congrats to the Meta team on today's launches! I saw some of the tech while it was still in development... the glasses, AR interface, neural band and overall capabilities are extraordinary. And yes, live demos can fail. We've all been there.

Meta is doing some insane stuff that doesn't get enough recognitionRihard Jarc / @rihardjarc:   The $META failed demos were not great, but that is noise.  What $META delivered yesterday with its first Display smartglasses and EMG wristband is a huge consumer innovation at an affordable price point that we haven't seen in decades.  It is truly impressive.  The EMG wristband is something to focus on...TJ Parker / @tjparker:   Meta execs are ~20 years younger than Apple's and still willing to do live demos. Unfortunately very bearish on Apple.Mina Fahmi / @minafahmi_:   The Neural Band was the main product I worked on at CTRL-labs/Meta, as a small part of a big effort to create a new interface A low latency on-device model trained at massive scale, in a custom wearable, powering an intricate interaction design.. that ultimately feels simple ✨ [image]Wu Xu / @xuwu:   Hard to believe it's the 12th Meta Connect already.
