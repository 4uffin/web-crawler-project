This page provides a place to discuss new items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page (see past items in the ITN archives). Do not report errors in ITN items that are already on the Main Page here— discuss those at the relevant section of WP:ERRORS.
This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. A light green header appears under each daily section – it includes transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day. You can discuss ITN candidates under the header.

Glossary
Blurbs are one-sentence summaries of the news story.
Altblurbs, labelled alt1, alt2, etc., are alternative suggestions to cover the same story.
A target article, bolded in text, is the focus of the story. Each blurb must have at least one such article, but you may also link non-target articles.
Articles in the Ongoing line describe events getting continuous coverage.
The Recent deaths (RD) line includes any living thing whose death was recently announced. Consensus may decide to create a blurb for a recent death.
All articles linked in the ITN template must pass our standards of review. They should be up-to-date, demonstrate relevance via good sourcing and have at least an acceptable quality.
Nomination steps
Make sure the item you want to nominate has an article that meets our minimum requirements and contains reliable coverage of a current event you want to create a blurb about. We will not post about events described in an article that fails our quality standards.
Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates manually – a bot does that for us each day at midnight (UTC).
Create a level 4 header with the article name (==== Your article here ====). Add (RD) or (Ongoing) if appropriate.
Then paste the {{ITN candidate}} template with its parameters and fill them in. The news source should be reliable, support your nomination and be in the article. Write your blurb in simple present tense. Below the template, briefly explain why we should post that event. After that, save your edit. Your nomination is ready!
You may add {{ITN note}} to the target article's talk page to let editors know about your nomination.
The better your article's quality, the better it covers the event and the wider its perceived significance (see WP:ITNSIGNIF for details), the better your chances of getting the blurb posted.

Headers
When the article is ready, updated and there is consensus to post, you can mark the item as (Ready). Remove that wording if you feel the article fails any of these necessary criteria.
Admins should always separately verify whether these criteria are met before posting blurbs marked (Ready). For more guidance, check WP:ITN/A.
If satisfied, change the header to (Posted).
Where there is no consensus, or the article's quality remains poor, change the header to (Closed) or (Not posted).
Sometimes, editors ask to retract an already-posted nomination because of a fundamental error or because consensus changed. If you feel the community supports this, remove the item and mark the item as (Pulled).
Voicing an opinion on an item
Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated.
Please do...
ShortcutWP:ITNCDOWP:ITNCDO
Pick an older item to review near the bottom of this page, before the eligibility runs out and the item scrolls off the page and gets abandoned in the archive, unused and forgotten.
Review an item even if it has already been reviewed by another user. You may be the first to spot a problem, or the first to confirm that an identified problem was fixed. Piling on the list of "support!" votes will help administrators see what is ready to be posted on the Main Page.
Tell about problems in articles if you see them. Be bold and fix them yourself if you know how, or tell others if it's not possible.
Please do not...
ShortcutWP:ITNCDONTWP:ITNCDONT
Add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are not helpful. A vote without reasoning means little for us, please elaborate yourself.
Oppose an item just because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. We post a lot of such content, so these comments are generally unproductive.
Accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). We at ITN do not handle conflicts of interest.
Comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s).
Oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. Discuss them here.
Use ITN as a forum for your own political or personal beliefs. Such comments are irrelevant to the outcome and are potentially disruptive.
Suggesting updates
There are two places where you can request corrections to posted items:
Anything that does not change the intent of the blurb (spelling, grammar, markup issues, updating death tolls etc.) should be discussed at WP:Errors.
Discuss major changes in the blurb's intent or very complex updates as part of the current ITNC nomination.

Nominator's comments: We rarely nominate boxing matches, but we do so sometimes, such as Mayweather's last fight and Usyk winning over Fury. This is an exceptional win and no one in this era has ever become undisputed champion in three different classes, by every boxing organization. HadesTTW (he/him • talk) 05:52, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Needs work I'm not sure of the standing of the super middleweight class and Zuffa Boxing but, in any case, the article doesn't yet have a report of what actually happened in the match. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:27, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support on notability,
The Independent, The Mirror, CNN, BBC Sport, Al Jazeera. Boxing seems underrepresented at ITN, in the past decade we've only posted Mayweather-McGregor, Mayweather-Pacquiao, and Usyk-Fury Kowal2701 (talk) 10:58, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
LOL we've posted more boat races than boxing fights in the last 10 years? Howard the Duck (talk) 13:38, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support on notability per Kowal, oppose on quality as the target article needs more prose. The Kip (contribs) 14:58, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support on notability I've added a few additional sources here from non-sports outlets that talk about how this significance. Oppose only quality. Masem (t) 15:02, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Updated and nominated by Chipmunkdavis (talk · give credit)
Article updatedNominator's comments: Substantial and unusual announcement of a "totally" integrated military, even allowing for potential ministerial hyperbole. Both militaries will be able to hire the others' citizens. The agreement comes in the context of growing competition for influence in the Pacific with China, as well as with the symbolic 50th anniversary of one country's independence from the other. This story will go on for a couple of days, with formal signing expected in the next day or two. (The agreement itself probably sits on the edge of notability at the moment, will likely become much more firmly notable in the near future.) CMD (talk) 20:17, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Good faith nom, however there are some issues I have with this nomination; A) the target article is not directly primarily about the subject. I feel personally that ITN blurbs should target either the dedicated articles about the subject/event of the blurb or have substantial focus of the subject/event. There is currently relatively little prose about the announcement in the target article. B) I feel most treaty signings/announcements in general are a bit run of the mill to blurb C) relatively low impact/coverage globally. 5.57.243.123 (talk) 21:40, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Nominated by 82.132.187.52 (talk · give credit)
Nominator's comments: Part the wider "2025 British anti-immigration protests" (see that Wikipedia page). Seems significant that there are only 5,000 counter protestors (but that may be due to the police, not a lack of will). 82.132.187.52 (talk) 16:18, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong oppose the current blurb if nothing else. Considering the population of the United Kingdom is in the range of 60,000,000, 110,000,000 seems a bit of an odd estimate to me. The article cited in the page 2025 British anti-immigration protests cites 100,000. I want to see an article for Unite the Kingdom be created, or for there to be more than a one paragraph update at the target on it. Departure– (talk) 16:26, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There was an article, but it seems to have vanished. I can only assume the current offical estimate of 110k has been put out because it sounds less scary than the "more than 100,000" that your cite actually says. Worth noting that London itself has under 10 million people, and the biggest ever march in London was probably the 1.5 million who opposed the Iraq War. But 110k is not exactly small, and it definitely feels significant that they now outnumber the counter protesters by 20 to 1. It would be helpful to know why. 82.132.187.52 (talk) 16:51, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose While large in size, this seems to have lacked any significant impact - non-violent (good), no expected change yet as a result (compared to, for example, the Nepal protests). Masem (t) 17:04, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's not how UK politics/protest works. The significance is the size, specifically that in the eyes of the organizers it has been a huge success (true mass attendance, headline news, failure of the counter protest). You will never see a UK Prime Minister stand down or change policy under these circumstances. Arguably he already made a significant change to satisfy them, he just did it before the protest actually happened. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9rg9jj5kro Do not compare Nepal (or America) to the UK, they are (wildly) different countries. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 18:30, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There is pretty much some protest going on somewhere in the world at any time, we have to be selective of what protests make sense to post to avoid ITN from becoming a protest tracker. A large but otherwise non-violent protest is very low on importance, compared to one that has caused an entire govt to collapse. Masem (t) 18:46, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It doesn’t sound like you've put much thought into this at all. Would I be wrong in assuming you don't really have the first clue who Tommy Robinson, Nigel Farage, Shabana Mahmood or Kier Starmer even are? If the answer is no, then respectfully, please recognise you're probably not qualified to even give an opinion on what is and is not a significant protest in the UK. Your entire comment is inapplicable to the UK context - neither the poll tax protests of the 1990s or the Iraq War protests of the 2000s led to a change of government. But most will identify those as the two most significant political protests in recent UK history. Neither led to any immediate consequences, because that's not the British way of doing things. The day a mass protest in the UK leads to an immediate change in government, is the day Wikipedia will be completely irrelevant, because that will surely be the day something will have gone seriously wrong in the UK at large. Unimaginably wrong. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 19:39, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Anyone is allowed to voice their opinion at an open discussion of a matter like this and regionalism being used to gatekeep consensus building of such by suggesting someone outside of the area is "probably not qualified to even give an opinion" is not helpful in the slightest. Masem has a good point here, in my opinion, regardless of their knowledge of UK politics. The same argument could be used for a similar protest anywhere else in the world, because the substance of the argument is the same regardless of the specific people it concerns. Departure– (talk) 19:53, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How is it a good point? Unless I have misunderstood it, it's a de facto ban on considering any political protest significant if it occurred in a non-violent politically stable country. Which is obviously nonsense because this is an encyclopedia where all countries are equally relevant, not a tabloid which only concerns itself with eye catching chaotic countries. Who benefits from this approach? Masem can't even answer that if he has absolutely no idea how many times his argument will have meant a politically significant protest in the UK has been rejected by Wikipedia. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 21:13, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
My point is that there are far too many protests that occur on a routine basis that to give any protest that lacks any clear and immediate impact a space on ITN would be too low of a bar and would lead to us likely to post protests on a nearly-daily basis. ITN is not a newspaper and is meant to feature quality articles that reflect the coverage in the news, and for the most part, non-violent protests tend to get minimal news treatment (even locally), whereas those with immediate effects often get far wider coverage that justifies the reason to post them.
This is nothing about UK politics, because the same is true for US politics or EU politics or the like. Masem (t) 23:34, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm going to add that at this stage the protests are still not ITN, but they are also still occurring with some heating up (a dozen some ppl arrested today). It could turn worse at which point that would become more likely as an ITN. Masem (t) 13:20, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Nepal’s “protests” were destructive riots followed by an overthrow of government. UtK is unlikely to be an inflection point. Current Events is the right home for this. Dr Fell (talk) 18:33, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Why are people even comparing this protest to what happened in Nepal? It's nonsense. There are sound reasons to believe this is already an era defining inflection point in UK politics, induced by protests. It stands in stark contrast to how this and other recent governments have reacted to mass but peaceful protests. This exact government has already flatly refused to give in to several rallies held for gaza, climate, welfare and tax policy. Their response to this movement is different. They're in an existential crisis, with Reform UK having already effectively destroyed the other mainstream UK party. There's the significance, for anyone who doesn't really understand the subtleties of how things now work in this peaceful two party democracy in a post-2008 world. Perhaps because they're numbed to the chaos of Trump's America, or the general violence seen elsewhere. This is not normal. The complete failure of the counter protest, is the truly scary part. That's new. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 20:20, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Because the events in Nepal quickly and directly led to a change in government. This isn't a venue to discuss politics only the notability of events. If UtK results in Starmer making a notable concession to the demands of the protesters or if it results in a collapse of his government, those events could be worth an ITN item. (I don’t see how Starmer can shift much to the right before he starts losing MPs to the fledgling Your Party.) There has to be a notable event for this to be featured news. The Met estimate is 110,000 attendees. I've seen reports that the actual number is higher but cannot find a reliable source with a solid estimate. The Iraq War protest in 2003 had over a million in attendance. The UtK rally would need numbers that high to be significant enough on its own to warrant mention. Or it would need to produce a significant political development – policy concession, MP defections in large numbers, leadership challenge, general election called, etc. Finally, to use somewhat fiery language, the 2025 British anti-immigration protests article that would be linked to is in a sorry state. Rather than documenting the event and offering balanced analysis, it’s overtly biased. Dr Fell (talk) 21:37, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment As of now, Unite the Kingdom rally is a redirect to the page 2025 British anti-immigration protests, but there is no prose on the 13 September rally outside the lede, itself uncited. Departure– (talk) 18:58, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The No Kings protest saw a higher percentage of the country and a higher total number of people protest, and it wasn't posted. Protests only become notable enough for ITN when they lead to immediate change or some sort of riot, and until that happens, it won't be posted. Elipticon (talk) 20:18, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Whoever decided that should be the rule, is an idiot. It's a de facto ban on noting any significant political protests in the UK. I can't think of a single protest in recent UK history that would ever meet this ridiculous criteria, biased as it is toward violent and politically unstable chaotic countries. And for what purpose? Only a fool would think UK politics is not something the readers of Wikipedia are interested in, surely. The country has never felt less politically stable, and that's saying something given what happened in the last decade with Brexit etc. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 20:41, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

What a ridiculous opinion. People must be off their heads if they genuinely think the UK would change its government due to a peaceful protest of even this size. When the hell has that even happened? They must be barking mad if it genuinely takes people dying before Wikipedia should deem a "protest" to be significant. The word is PROTEST, not riot or revolution. Similarly if they want to see widespread chaos. The UK isn't France, it is perfectly possible for 100,000 people to make their opinions known without bringing the country to a halt. What you moronically call a "nothing burger" is a very large protest speaking to a very major issue that everyone here is hoping doesn’t get so badly handled it leads to a change of government any time soon, because that would be very very bad. But at least then, when the violence really erupts and centuries of political orthodoxy is overturned, maybe then you might deem it worthy. At which point, who the hell would care anyway? How self important do you people really imagine you are, if you assume a world where a country as important as the UK is, is in such dire straits over such an explosive issue that there is widespresd chaos and deaths and changes in government, anyone would still have the time or inclination to bother with Wikipedia at all? If the UK government is ever toppled by a mass march, that would probably be about the same time the USA is in a full scale civil war. So good luck with that. Hard to keep charity funded servers online in such a scenario, I would have thought. 82.132.186.240 (talk) 23:39, 13 September 2025 (UTC) Stuck!, Harassment to the editor.ROY is WAR Talk! 10:25, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support as per TDKR. 64.114 etc 19:43, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I oppose. Conviction is not sentence. I'm keeping up with it minute by minute, and the sentence should come out only tomorrow, so the time he will be imprisoned has not yet been defined. ArionStar (talk) 19:49, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The conviction has always been the point we consider the point of posting. If the sentence is tomorrow, we can update the blurb with it but there's no reason to wait for that. Masem (t) 19:53, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
With the update, the blurb would be posted as a September 12 event, not September 11. We should wait. No rush, please. ArionStar (talk) 19:59, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Given that the sentence was known to happen soon, sure. But normally, sentencing in cases like this comes weeks to months later, which is why we have nearly always posted at conviction, not sentencing, when the story is actually in te news. Masem (t) 22:29, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In the meantime, it's virtually September 12 already, as this debate continues. I see no need to wait, when we can edit it later today. Nfitz (talk) 23:44, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support after sentencing per all above. Obviously notable event. The Kip (contribs) 20:43, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
SIince there seems to be agreement to wait fir the sentence that is supposed to happen tomorrow, I've added an alt blurb to fill in the terms of sentence once known. I urge editors to still review the article in the meantime for quality and update. Masem (t) 20:47, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support (with a day's delay, if that's consensus). Alt-2 suggested, to avoid three "Brazilians" in the blurb. Moscow Mule (talk) 21:32, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No idea why sentencing is considered more important here. We have always posted convictions, and rarely posted sentencings, as convictions are what is in the news. Moot Support posting now, as this is a major story (but no issue in waiting a day or two). Natg 19 (talk)
Also added alt 3 which combines the conviction and sentencing. Natg 19 (talk) 22:02, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose: The trial of Bolsonaro has been already posted Cambalachero (talk) 23:30, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That wasn't a trial, @Cambalachero. That was merely a political restriction - not a criminal trial. The trial didn't even begin until a few days ago! Nfitz (talk) 23:47, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In addition to what Nfitz pointed out, the consequences of these decisions are very different. Previously, he was barred from running for office for eight years. Now he is sentenced to 27 years in prison. There is a big difference between those two restrictions/sentences. I don't see this story as a "repeat" of the previous one, even if it might build on the previous 2023 story in some way. 98.170.164.88 (talk) 23:52, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Distinction without a difference. It's about Bolsonaro's legal woes either way, and over the same stuff to boot (they are not two unrelated cases over different things). The point is, this story has already been posted, and only details changed. Cambalachero (talk) 00:42, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Political ineligibility of Jair Bolsonaro ≠ Conviction of Bolsonaro. ArionStar (talk) 01:04, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Huge difference. And how many times do we post Trump's frequent convictions and various aspects of the Israeli war. Nfitz (talk) 01:04, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If I found out I couldn't run for the presidency of Brazil, I'd be somewhat upset. I think I would be a little more so if I were sentenced to three decades in prison. Bremps... 02:02, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

You shouldn't switch what is the target article without gaining consensus on its quality first. Its fine to link the trial article without bolding, but we'd need discussion to consider it as featured. Masem (t) 15:32, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What Masem said. The "supports" above were for the coup article to be bolded, which provides a much better introduction to the topic for those who might not have been following this news. Moscow Mule (talk) 17:34, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's getting into the weeds (that they haven't actual read the sentence to him and the post-reading dealings that might go on to reduce it).
Also, the coup plot article is far better quality than the trial article, though it can still be linked, just not bolded. Masem (t) 15:29, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The plot article has issues, while his personal article hasn’t. ArionStar (talk) 15:47, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose: A single academic paper publishing a result not yet independently confirmed or peer-reviewed is not newsworthy. Definitely feels this is being pushed more than a bit too aggressively into ITN. Should this get a gong, it should be posted beneath the Charlie Kirk assassination story. Dr Fell (talk) 19:27, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is absolutely a peer reviewed paper. Masem (t) 19:55, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I retract "or peer-reviewed" but remain opposed. Highly suspect why this is being pushed so hard. So many supports without any actual article in place. And again, the first report of an initial finding does not rise to the level an ITN item. This is comparable to yesterday's signs of life on Mars story. Dr Fell (talk) 20:13, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"Highly suspect"?
Seriously, it's a remarkable confirmation of two of the most important predictions from Einstein's General Relativity, made back in the 60's and 70's. Roy Kerr is a potential Nobelist even. There is absolutely no comparison with the life on Mars story, which is excellent but rather minor xenochemistry, with a marginal xenobiology hook that isn't going anywhere for perhaps decades to come.
And for the record, we've covered ITN scientific results based on first peer-reviewed publication.
I am the IP who nominated this item, and I am also the IP who removed the "Ready" tag.
The point of Support is to see get one or the other candidate target 128.91.40.237 (talk) 21:52, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Have you looked at the author list? It's huge (I didn't count but its over 50). Its one of those papers that they likely collaborated heavily between different research schools and other groups to make sure the results were as they determined. Add the peer review by the publication itself, and any "highly suspect" aspect is just not there. Maybe if this was from a small group from some no-name school, then we could have some doubt, but that's simply not the case here. Masem (t) 02:23, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't doubt the paper. But I found – and still find – it suspect this was being pushed into ITN so forcefully with so many blind Supports before an appropriate article was ready. Dr Fell (talk) 04:50, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

If only there some Encyclopædia where one could quickly look up things one didn't know! Nfitz (talk) 23:51, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Those articles are equally incomprehensible. What is a "Kerr black hole overtone"? We don't actually have an article on "Kerr black hole"; that redirects to Kerr metric, which doesn't offer a quick definition of "Kerr black hole". It also doesn't include the word "overtone" anywhere. (For the record, I've been editing Wikipedia since 2005, so you don't need to be snarky.) Zagalejo (talk) 00:05, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

It is still extremely stubby but could easily be fixed by adding a paragraph or two to frame why this analysis is important.

Respectfully, I'm going to remove the "Ready" label for now, which should be used for items that are obviously ready given a clear consensus. Currently, it does not appear clear at all. The article is a start-class article, and the alt blurb III is confusing, as one cannot claim "Two black holes merge" in the present tense. Rather, it's the observation and publication of the findings that is the current event. Another admin can evaluate it differently but for now, I think it's not accurate to label it ready. - Fuzheado | Talk 15:12, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Strong oppose. I revised the blurb a while ago at the lower ITN and it's a lot more complicated and a lot less concrete than this blurb posits:
An article published in Nature announces that the Perseverance rover discovered vivianite, greigite, and various organic compounds in rocks at Cheyava Falls on Mars, in what Administrator of NASA Sean Duffy claims may be "the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars". While greigite can be produced without the influence of life, current geological models of Mars do not support that the rocks were formed above 250 °C (482 °F), the temperature needed to form the mineral in a laboratory. (The New York Times)
It's equally likely that Mars' geological models are wrong or another event caused the greigite formations. Per EF5, we really shouldn't be jumping the gun for the discovery that we aren't alone in the universe, and official statements for whether or not this is a sign of life have all used an awful lot of weaselly and uncertain language (again, for the discovery of a singe mineral that doesn't conclusively prove life exists on Mars).

It appears that the next step for the samples would be a return to Earth for closer study but that is years away and uncertain because of budget cuts. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:35, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are several benchmarks that must be met between a discovery of this caliber and a clear and explicit "We found extraterrestrial life!" statement. They have to rule out contamination and errors in the readings, rule out all abiotical explanations, find a second and independent discovery, etc. All those will take years. If this is life indeed, the news will not be now, it will be in some years and be something like this:; "Remember when we thought we found life on Mars in 2025? Yeah, it took years, but it's confirmed!" Cambalachero (talk) 18:12, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support This seems to be a significant finding; for example, National Geographic, "This is the best evidence yet for ancient life on Mars".
The uncertainty seems inevitable as fossil microbes are hard to be sure about.
As it will be years before more detailed analysis, it seems reasonable to report the finding now, while it's in the news. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:32, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support although I agree with Chorchapu that the bolded article should be Cheyava Falls. Just because it isn't a confirmed finding doesn't mean it's not newsworthy or unencyclopedic. The "best evidence yet" for alien life actually sounds quite significant and interesting for the reader. It's also refreshing to have a non-political blurb every once in a while. 9ninety (talk) 06:47, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The close was bad as the discussion had only lasted for about 90 minutes and the opposes were low quality.
This is respectable science based on a peer-reviewed paper in Nature and is getting reasonably serious coverage in the mainstream media.
Science, by its nature, is usually provisional rather than being a sure thing and this observation seems significant in moving the evidence-base forward.
The item deserves proper consideration. Andrew🐉(talk) 09:12, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not going to close this again, but I'm going to starkly oppose the characterization of the close as bad. When I closed this under WP:SNOW, there were 11 opposes to 0 supports beyond the nom. Departure– (talk) 17:45, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong support: Sources have consistently noted this to be the "best evidence yet," "strongest evidence yet," "biggest clue," or "clearest sign" of ancient life on Mars. Found as unique and significant by NPR, AP, NatGeo, CNN, Reuters, CBC, BBC, Live Science, NYT, PBS, Scientific American, among others. This is one of the most central scientific questions to humanity! Yes, it isn't definitive proof, but that's what empiricism and peer review is about; it's slow and cautious. We also must note this finding is about a year old, just slowed down by peer review and extended review of alternative explanations. That they've gone this far and still find it to be the strongest piece of evidence yet of extraterrestrial life is very much newsworthy on its own. Again, the media (including both popular and scientific news) seems to agree with this with their reporting of it as the best finding yet in this subject area. LaborHorizontal (talk) 09:52, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Completly agree. The fact Wikipedia refuses to post real, significant, ground-breaking and peer reviewed science in its home page, but immediatelly posts the shooting of a random person in the US that has absolutely zero international recogniziton, is a joke. I will note that the search for life on Mars has been considered the top priority in planetary exploration in the last two decades by the Planetary Science Decadal Survey and the findings in this study reaffirm the importance of the Mars Sample Return mission many want to cancel. And to those saying this finding is "inconclusive": Science is never conclusive. The discovery of extraterrestrial life will not be like in the movies where scientists suddently find a random worm moving in the surface. Science is always slow and methodical and the fact the researches in this study remain cautious is a good thing. The fact remains that this is the greatest evidence of extraterrestrial life yet.
I
support the nomination. Agile Jello (talk) 10:29, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Agile Jello: I disagree. While many social sciences are inconclusive and similar findings may be considered significant, astrobiology is quite rigorous and the question 'Has there ever been life on Mars?' has a simple 'Yes' or 'No' answer. This finding is only a partial result that points out that life may have existed on Mars, but it simply doesn't provide sufficient evidence to make a general conclusion (this is like getting to a partial result that solves the Collatz conjecture in mathematics). So, either there has or there has not been life on Mars, and the answer is 'No' until it's proved to be 'Yes'. We don't need to post every step in the indefinite process of attempting to refute the current answer.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 11:57, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I disagree. Finding life on other planets is extremely difficult and unless aliens come visit us it's highly unlikely our first evidence of life would be something definitive. Even saying that there is a simple answer to life existing on Mars is wrong as we don't know how life on other worlds would look like and how it could be at the boundary between geological and biological processes. Also, saying that is the answer is "no" before it's proved is extremely dangerous and unscientific as it goes against the idea of scientific skepticism (the correct answer would be "we don't know"). And yes, we should post major scientific discoveries in all fields even if they are not conclusive. This is the type of content an encyclopedia should embrace the most. Enough with these useless US-centric political dramas, sports events, and random tragedies with no long-term impact in the world that get posted just because x people died. Agile Jello (talk) 13:07, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In science, the answer is ‘No’ until it’s proved otherwise (the null hypothesis is that there’s no extraterrestrial life). You can use the phrase ‘we don’t know’ in philosophy where it has elaborated interpretations. An encyclopaedia documents verified knowledge, not someone’s beliefs or partial results based on assumptions. I agree that Wikipedia should cover more scientific stories on the main page, but this is definitely not one of them. --Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 16:06, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong support. As per LaborHorizontal, sources have consistently noted this the best evidence of ancient life on Mars. 24.84.42.180 (talk) 14:22, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Precedent FYI, there was a previous posting in 2018,
NASA reports the discovery of complex organic molecules in samples collected by Curiosity from the Gale crater on Mars.
That wasn't conclusive either. Andrew🐉(talk) 10:35, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose I think we've got a couple issues here, first that how many times can NASA or other groups say "we've found evidence of life on Mars" before it becomes a "cry wolf" situation, so any further claim really needs to drive towards irrefutable evidence. To which my second point, the lead researcher on this, quoted by BBC, even warns this is not strong evidence but merely a driver to study these formations more, quoting "We have found features in the rocks that if you saw them on Earth could be explained by biology - by microbial process. So we're not saying that we found life, but we're saying that it really gives us something to chase." Even they aren't saying its evidence, just an avenue they are asking to persue. Masem (t) 12:06, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak support &ndashl Cheyava Falls can use some structural work, but these are two lovely articles regardless. The "discovery" of extraterrestrial life was always going to be a very slow and gradual process, but that doesn't mean we can't celebrate every step on the way. It always feels like a great excuse to show off the work we've done on Perseverance (rover) over the past years as well. If only every field had big news stories like this every few years; that would make our job for ITN a lot easier. Perseverence and life on Mars are in the news, so it would be a nice feature. ~Maplestrip/Mable (chat) 12:37, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose generally per above. While I understand that we've posted a similar story before, the word "potential" still is pulling a lot of weight here. While I think we generally know that the process to deducing ancient life on other planets would not be as simple as just finding a fossil or something, the article itself only contains a small subsection on this discovery, which again is largely qualified by the use of "potential" and "possible". Perhaps one day this specific discovery will be considered a big step in confirming the existence of extraterrestrial life, but at this point, that is still TBD. DarkSide830 (talk) 18:00, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

STRONGEST SUPPORT. Noteworthy news story, with news sources complimenting the discovery (“greatest discovery”, etc.). 207.194.85.134 (talk) 21:50, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose for now it's a story for enthusiasts. Per the BBC page, "The only way to fully confirm if the minerals were made by microbes would be to bring the rocks back to Earth for analysis. A Mars sample return mission has been proposed by Nasa and Esa but its future looks highly uncertain." Which means it's going to remain a story for enthusiasts for years more. Banedon (talk) 08:44, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak support: It's a notable find, and per Departure, it could still shake up our understanding of the Red Planet and its geology. However, per EF5 and Departure, this is a potential sign of life, and it could very well turn out to be anything. Besides, it's always best to tread carefully when reporting on such big scientific headlines, since it's the nature of science that things can and do get disproved at any moment. Remember that one time we thought we found life on Venus but it turned out to be a calibration error? NoOneFliesAroundTheSun (talk) 01:57, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Wait/Oppose blurb Per Masem, I don't think Kirk is important enough a world figure to qualify for a blurb (indeed, I'm pretty sure 95% of the world's population has never heard of him), but yes, it could have further implications down the line, which we can address if it comes to that.

Wait as there's basically no details out. The most important is whether he survived the shooting or not. If he did, then I doubt that this is that significant to post. If he passed away, then it'd be blurbed not due to his stature (the part everyone around here harps upon for ITN deaths) but rather the nature of the death: yes, shootings are common, but politically-motivated assassinations are rare & startling enough in the world that I recall we pretty much always blurb them unless part of a larger event already listed in ITN. Nottheking (talk) 20:23, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What do you mean, "his stature"?
As I said above, most of the world has never heard of him and looking at his article he does not seem to be a particularly important political figure. As far as I can see, he mostly seems to be famous for promoting conspiracy theories. Black Kite (talk) 20:26, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The point they were making is that his stature was small and that that isn’t relevant. A
political figure was assassinated due to their politics (if he dies). They’re making the point that that is relevant enough. 1brianm7 (talk) 20:31, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, I misread that, but it makes my point; how important does someone have to be to qualify for a blurb if they are shot dead in a country which has thousands of gun deaths a year?
I would say; more important than Kirk, unless the shooting has further consequences down the line, and anything is possible with the current administration. Black Kite (talk) 20:38, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If Kirk dies, it was because he was assassinated. The U.S. does not have thousands of assassinations per year. The last major assassination by my count, was in June, of a state representative, somebody who was much less politically prominent than Kirk (and who got on ITN). If political figures were getting assassinated everyday, you’d have a point, but they aren’t. 1brianm7 (talk) 20:43, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, but you're missing my point.
If an elected political figure was assassinated, then clearly that's a major story.
But Kirk is a political activist in a country where there are a lot of political activists.
Plus see my reply to TDKR Chicago 101 below. Black Kite (talk) 20:47, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's like saying that there's a 'lot of humans' therefore no human's death should ever be blurbed. You're straying from the important part, is that political assassinations in the entire western world are rare. Nottheking (talk) 23:56, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Strong oppose - non-fatal shooting of a private individual holding no office. If he died unremarkably I'd imagine a blurb nomination would be opened but pushed down, and him surviving an assassination attempt means little on the world scale. Turning Point Action isn't at the top of my list for American conservative groups, either in influence, notoriety, or numbers; a lot of people helped Trump win 2024.

Strong support blurb. I think the main argument should be how rare it is for a politically motivated assassionation in the U.S. to occur. Sure Kirk is a notable right-wing commentator/influencer but the manner of this death: a young man being publicly assassinated in front of a big crowd, well, that's the story right there. That is pretty rare. For a figure so prominent on the news/political scene to be gunned down in public.
--TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 20:39, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A good faith question, though; if the news story is a very rare politically motivated shooting (and I admit they are rare - there's the Trump one, but let's not go there), should it matter if Kirk dies or not?

The public killing of a comparatively high-profile individual like this warrants a blurb. Frankly, I think this should probably have been blurbed even if it had been non-fatal, compare e.g. Stabbing of Salman Rushdie, which we blurbed.

I maintain an oppose on this blurb per other reasons; Turning Point Action really isn't the loudest nor most influential in US politics, and while similar shootings such as this year's on legislators have been posted, I'd like to add that there was a consensus against posting Jean-Marie Le Pen's blurb, despite him founding National Rally, one of the biggest contemporary conservative organizations that was well above the importance of Turning Point. Kirk's influence on US and thus world politics was minimal compared to Le Pen, and nor too did Kirk hold any office, nor do anything notable enough to warrant a blurb in my eyes. I haven't seen the article's quality and will hold out on a !vote in that regard for now. Departure– (talk) 21:26, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I try not to change blurbs I post (too much), but Right-wing American just read awkward to me, so I switched it to American right-wing. That's moot, though, since after The ed17 changed the proposed blurb to remove 'right-wing' (diff), I adjusted accordingly (diff).

Thanks El C. I didn't see that you'd posted the blurb when I made that edit—I'm a little surprised we didn't edit conflict in the literal one second that separated our edits (at least according to navigation popups). We didn't include political leanings/affilations for the Minnesota shootings or the Colombian senator, and I wanted to be consistent. Ed [talk] [OMT] 00:43, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Its one thing on the article itself where there is room for sourcing and/or attribution for using contentious terms and labels (including if appropriate stating as fact but with immediate sourcing), but at ITN we absolutely should not be including those terms. We often even avoid political party naming unless we're talking government bodies that are formed by political parties. Masem (t) 00:49, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Np, Ed, but no edit conflict was possible even in theory, because you edited WP:ITNC and I (having seen that) had edited WP:ITN. At the event and as the diffs show, though, your change (at 19:12 UTC) preceded mine by 5 minutes (at 19:17 UTC). HTH. El_C 01:15, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Pull blurb I can't believe that we argued for days over the posting of assassinations of two actual politicians, but a pundit who's never held office and has had relatively little longstanding influence gets posted within minutes.
Kirk made no substantial contributions to polticial thought even domestically, let alone worldwide.
–DMartin 23:41, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Nobody is hinging their support on Kirk’s contributions to society; it’s about the shocking and newsworthy nature of the death. If he dropped dead of cancer today, this obviously would not have been nominated. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 00:00, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It might be shocking and newsworthy to Americans who have heard of him. But a racist far-right podcaster with a low international profile should not be ITN. No prejudice in posting if the US government is behind the shooting. Nfitz (talk) 00:06, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ok even though this just doesnt relate to the policy about personal attacks, your definitely making a personal attack against a dead man (who is the subject of this blurb) which is just straight up disrespectful, even if you have conflicting beliefs, this guy got SHOT for his political beliefs (something we saw before 2 years ago) shane (talk) 12:00, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How is it a personal attack to note his racism, @EditorShane3456? Our own article clearly notes (and has noted for a long time), his vocalizing his bizarre White Replacement conspiracy theory. That's not even casual or systemic racism? That's hard-core hatred! We also don't know why he was shot. We can guess - but there's plenty of politicians shot for nothing to do with their political beliefs - let along a podcaster! Nfitz (talk) 21:02, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

47,000 shooting deaths, but very few assassinations of an otherwise notable (in the sense that he passes WP:N) public figure while he is delivering remarks in a public place. that’s what grounds the notability of the shooting. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 00:18, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Which qualifies him for a RD. Assassination? We have no indication of motive or who the target was - so that's speculative. Probably the target I'd guess - but guesses don't count. Was Corey Comperatore also assassinated? Nfitz (talk) 05:53, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Dmartin969: Being a politician doesn't make some one more influential. People like Ben Shapiro  5, Jon Stewart  5, Cenk Uygur  5, etc are much more influential than the vast majority of U.S. state representatives.

Post-posting support Seems to pass WP:ITNSIGNIF. This is being covered in all major American news outlets, and many non-American outlets, with frequent updates. I was surprised by how quickly this blurb was posted to ITN, but I don't necessarily see that as a problem. To respond to a couple of the objections above:(1) Systemic bias is indeed an issue to address, but "US-centrism" is not a good reason to oppose the posting of any given US story, per WP:ITNATA. A better way to address systemic bias would be to nominate more stories from other parts of the world. (2) His level of significance is hard to assess objectively and depends on what metric you look at. He was not necessarily a universally famous household name in the US, but I think many who follow US politics, especially in younger generations, had at least heard of him. His article was the #10 most viewed page on Wikipedia:WikiProject Conservatism/Popular pages and #44 on Wikipedia:WikiProject Politics/Popular pages prior to his death, which I think says something. Pageviews aren't everything, of course. 98.170.164.88 (talk) 00:37, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Mild oppose on quality. The citations include a lot of social media posts (albeit official accounts, but secondary sources are preferred) and the tabloid TMZ. Only admins can edit it so it's not easy to fix or add more reliable sources. Perhaps the bolded link could be changed to Charlie Kirk or the blurb could be changed to RD.

For example, the number of readers for the Charlie Kirk article yesterday was about 15 million, which is enormous as these things go.

Post-posting support per above. Major news event, 100% notable. His words during his speech before he died was so impactful and powerful to everyone.

WP:ITNCDONT "Accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism)". You have accused others of pushing their politics on others, based on their nationality. But not all supporters of posting this are American, from what I can see of their bios or disclosed information. Unless you are accusing America of pushing this story onto other countries' media, like the top-of-the-page live updates on the BBC website and extended coverage on BBC TV. But it's more likely the foreign media are covering this without coercion. Other countries do exist, and they are posted, the next story on the ticker will be the ex-president of Brazil being jailed, for example.

Pull RD would suffice. Being praised as a kingmaker isn't really as notable as the king itself. Outside of America, Charlie Kirk may not be as widely covered before his death as one would think. At least in Singapore here, while he was mentioned in older articles, they were by the way kind, as comments to events happened during the election. – robertsky (talk) 01:55, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's of course not as notable, but still notable. I'd support posting other assassinations of kingmakers from any relatively "peaceful" country. Aaron Liu (talk) 02:02, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I am not doubting the notability of the person. I am saying that it does not rise to the level necessary for a blurb, a RD would suffice. Lee Kuan Yew credited many of his founding team as essential to his premiership, but most of them got RDs when they died because they don't matter beyond national borders (and yes the manner of their deaths aren't a violent one, this I will give). – robertsky (talk) 02:09, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Pull. It. Right. Now. According to the other editors with whom I agree: he’s never been in office, he’s had little legacy, and hasn’t contributed significantly to political thought worldwide or even domestically. Furthermore, it’s unfair that such situations only make it to ITN if they took place in the U.S. It's high time we reassessed the criteria used to determine when a recent death gets a blurb. 207.194.85.134 (talk) 21:32, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It is objectively untrue that domestic assassinations of political figures are never posted except for the United States. See e.g. Assassination of Miguel Uribe Turbay, Assassination of Andrei Karlov,
and Murder of David Amess, which we posted. I would not call Turbay (a Colombian Senator), Karlov (a Russian Ambassador to Turkey) or David Amess (a British backbencher), "significant contributors to worldwide political thought". And yet we posted them for the same reason we posted Kirk... because they were shot to death in a shocking manner that made worldwide headlines. It's really that simple. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 03:30, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The blurb was posted before it was established that it was an assassination attempt (ie politically motivated). And it was posted within four hours ie before most of the world could comment. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 08:22, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support finally this is nominated. I'd change the blurb to a wording in which Russia is the active actor, something like "Russia launches multiple drones into NATO member Poland" or "Multiple Russian drones enter NATO member Poland and are shot down".
There are several notable factors setting this event apart from others and I think at least one or two (ideally all three) should be highlighted in the blurb: 1. that they were over a dozen drones 2. that they reached deep into Poland 3. that they were shot down. Super Ψ Dro 15:26, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support per above, but I wonder (as has been mentioned by at least one other) if it may be a decent idea to include that Poland has invoked NATO Article 4. Maybe with that link or another one. But ultimately, it's not that common that it gets invoked - and about half of the times it's been invoked are preventative, or in other words before any actual incursion/military action against a NATO member.

Nominator's comments: Not one to give in to blurbing items from ongoing listings, but Israel has targeted another sovereign country. This being the mediating and non-neighboring Qatar I believe raises it to notability even beyond ongoing. Gotitbro (talk) 13:54, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Give this a few hours to get details. Al Jazeera claims the attack got the Hamas leader, so we need some firm details here. Masem (t) 14:02, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose as covered in ongoing. As a side note, where is AJ saying Hamas leader was killed? Dont see it.
QueensanditsCrazy (talk) 15:27, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It may have been on their on the spot coverage from earlier but since corrected or removed. Hence why waiting for such confirmations is critical in these types of events. Masem (t) 21:25, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - I don't see how another Israeli attack on Hamas isn't covered by ongoing. Nfitz (talk) 16:27, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak oppose While I see the argument that the nom is making, at the end of the day I agree a bit more with Nfitz in that it being an attack targeting Hamas (rather than Qatar and its leaders/military) puts it under the ongoing item. While the Haniyeh assassination is comparable, we posted that mainly because he of his notability as the leader of Hamas, not because Israel struck Iran. The Kip (contribs) 16:47, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait There seems to be considerable uncertainty about the outcome of the strike so we should wait for the dust to settle. Andrew🐉(talk) 16:57, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm amenable to waiting for more details, but I'm in favor of posting at some point per nom. While, yes, this attack was on Hamas leadership, it was in fact on Qatar's territory and without their authorization. How exactly things play out from here is TBD, but it does risk involving Qatar proper in the larger Israel-Palestine conflict, at the very least beyond just their prior role as a mediator. DarkSide830 (talk) 17:04, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait then strong support; this a huge escalation and is on the top of every news site in the US. But we need to wait for now as things are moving very fast. Chorchapu (talk | edits) 17:29, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Wait/support, striking the mediator of the conflict is a significant escalation. I'm not sure we need much more than the principle and the inevitable diplomatic fallout. Kowal2701 (talk) 21:13, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait/support. While we should hold off for a bit until some details are confirmed, striking Qatar in and of itself, without authorization from Qatar is enough to put this above ongoing. -- Patar knight - chat/contributions 21:41, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support per most above; see the sheer size of the international reactions. These reactions were primarily focused on how the attack was on Qatari soil, not how it targeted Hamas, and thus I don't believe Ongoing sufficiently covers this. Departure– (talk) 00:24, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Comment on quality There is zero need for a massive reaction section that basically just has most of the comments finger-wagging at the attack without any actual call to action or the like. That's article bloat that doesn't need to be there. Some reactions, like those actually involved here and the attempted ceasefire (Israel, Qatar, the US etc) make sense. At least some of the others, like with France, Germany and Spain, could be combined without using quotes to say other nations comdemned the attack without bullet-pointing each one. Masem (t) 05:19, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I agree. Maybe it'd be better to split that into a Reactions to article, where more countries like Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Maldives, etc., could be listed, keeping only the more pertinent ones in the parent article; or, not do that and just trim. I personally am not as hostile to the 'bullet point list with flag icons' approach as some, but indeed, it's like half the length of the article now. El_C 05:40, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Masem and El C: These are comments that are best directed at Talk:Israeli airstrike on Hamas leadership in Qatar. I've copied them there. Ed [talk] [OMT] 06:43, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
They apply here - its a quality issue being judged for ITN posting. (No, not asking this to be pulled but this needs to be considered in future ITNCs)
And splitting it out to a separate list article makes no sense. the section needs trimming. Reaction sections that just list statements is a lazy approach to trying to bulk up current event articles. Its the equivalent to the "thoughts and prayers" that come after a US mass shooting, statements with no actual actions behind them, despite being a reaction section. Of course the attack was criticized, so the focus should be on possible downstream impacts in the region including any threat of retaliatory action (like the disruption to the ceasefire talks). Masem (t) 12:28, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm sorry, but what? There was nowhere near a consensus to post this. Especially this rapidly. Consider this a PULL !vote given all the valid arguments against posting it that have been stated above. Most importantly the quality concerns as Masem noted - the current article is a massive attempt to right great wrongs as it provides undue weight to reactions, not to mention the other concerns others have had. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 05:48, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Any admin should feel free to pull, I need not be consulted or even notified. But I weighed there being a WP:ROUGHCONSENSUS (as such debates often trend), though maybe a bit at the margins in this case. El_C 05:52, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'll add some quotes of specific parts of the article that (in my view) are clearly RGW violations and any of which should have, on their own, been reason to at least temporarily withhold posting: Israel's vow; Those targeted were involved in negotiations for a ceasefire to the Gaza war - poorly sourced given current information - those targeted have not been confirmed to be a part of specific negotiations. This was too soon, at best. I am not opposed to posting in the near future, but it should not have been posted given the fact that the current article is massive NPOV/RGW violations. To be clear, @El C: I do not think you have done anything wrong - you made a determination based on the information and opinions present here. I still, however, think it's too soon to post this, and that the article needs a lot of work - to the point I think this should be pulled in the meantime. I appreciate that there is sometimes a push to post an article at ITN based on rough consensus even if it's too soon - and I don't fault you for abiding by what seems to be the norm here of post once there's a rough consensus - though I personally think that a "rough consensus" is not sufficient for something we are displaying on our main page - especially for a contentious topic.This is, as I'm sure everyone knows, a contentious topic. There's good reason it is such. And I think we would all do well to give more than ~12 hours before we post articles (about breaking news) in a CTOP to ITN. While ITN is a slight exception, we are not news. It's more important that we ensure that articles we post to the main page are, at a bare minimum, at least comprehensive and not being used as an attempt to RGW. There's at least three instances (that I identified above) that this article does not meet that criteria in my view. So it should be pulled until there is enough vision on the article to correct such attempts at RGW while it is on the main page. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 05:58, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm wary that articles that contentious will just not get posted because by the time there's such resolution, it would no longer be a news item. Thus, a nominal state which tends to be below average is to be expected. I also don't think there should be a 12-hour (or any other) clock imposed on articles or sets of articles. But that's a substantive and well-reasoned argument for pulling, and a valid view for how ITN should operate, especially for CTOP subject matters. El_C 06:09, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not seeing anything in favour of "those targeted have not been confirmed to be a part of specific negotiations" in the article, we have "Those targeted were involved in negotiations for a ceasefire to the Gaza war and an Israeli-Palestinian prisoner-hostage exchange. [cited to BBC] ... According to Reuters, the strike was expected to result in the temporary or permanent end of ceasefire negotiations in the war. Frank Lowenstein, the former U.S. special envoy for the Middle East, stated that the strike signified the Israeli government had not only lost interest in negotiating a ceasefire but was sufficiently confident that the negotiations would become irrelevant to proceed with assassinating the Hamas negotiating team. [cited to AP]"
Considering this was a failed assassination attempt, the only reason it is notable is due to the strong reactions and unprecedented nature of attacking Qatar. While the reactions can be trimmed, I am not seeing anything there justifying a straight up pulling. Similarly the "vow" part is not really a strong reason either, section titles can be easily changed and some may argue that it is POV from the Israeli side. Gotitbro (talk) 06:35, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I accept that maybe I'm not 100% up to date on the breaking news... but is it really a "failed assassination attempt"? I question both "failed" (i.e. did they truly fail, even if they didn't kill all targets) and "assassination attempt". To put it bluntly, targeting the military leadership of an organization you are at war with is not an "assassination attempt". It's a side effect of war. Regardless, those things being clarified (such as with further sourcing) is another reason for my argument to pull it temporarily as a too soon posting. In any case, I cannot fault the admin for posting it because I accept that my view that waiting to post to ITN/main page is better is not the overarching consensus.Regardless, I think improvements are necessary - and even since I made my original reply here, they are ongoing. That's the beauty of Wikipedia, of course. If this doesn't get pulled before it's improved to the point that pulling is unnecessary, I'm all for it - but I'll still encourage everyone to, especially in contentious topics, ask questions first and ensure that what we post on the main page is as close to perfect as possible - even if it's breaking news. In my opinion (which I appreciate may be completely against the consensus), it's better to wait even 24+ hours to post something "in the news" than to post an article sooner that is so breaking as to potentially fall victim to people using it to RGW while it's being heavily edited with breaking information. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 07:16, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"Failed": the article is currently under Category:Failed assassination attempts in Asia and considering that all of the high profile targets survived, I would say its apt and my charazterization of it followed as such. About war, see Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh (also Assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler) etc.
I can see your concerns about article quality but don' think they rise to the level of a pull, a pain to the process should only be had when the issues are very serious.
I agree about a time limit, a minimum one generally and ones for CTOPS specifically, and similar proposals have followed but I don't think this is going to gain traction among editors anytime soon. Gotitbro (talk) 16:23, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The "valid" arguments above were shortly after it occurred. It was fair enough at the time for it to be a wait. More has come out since. In addition, those reactions in the article are part of the reason why this is so noteworthy. The majority of voices were in support, for valid reasons. This feels more like a pull to bury it, rather than in good faith. Basetornado (talk) 06:12, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment – Is "marking the first known Israeli attack on the country" necessary for the blurb? Reads more like trivia. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 06:06, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is another reason I support pulling - until a more neutral non-RGW violating blurb can be crafted. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 06:08, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That was more to show it is notable. If it was an attack on Lebanon or Iran for example, that wouldn't be as notable, because that has occurred many times. By stating that it's the first attack on Qatar, it shows why it's so notable. Basetornado (talk) 06:13, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There was no attack on Qatar. The attack was clearly on Hamas (which is covered in ongoing). Did Iran attack Qatar too? Nfitz (talk) 22:03, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Change to Blurb1, I think it’s redundant, I’d like to think our reader knows a little about Qatar and the conflict, and it does seem RGW. If anything, I’d support mentioning Qatar's mediating role, but probably best not to overcomplicate Kowal2701 (talk) 09:08, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I agree that the tail end of the blurb is problematic and have logged it at WP:ERRORS.
Note also that it was not a nominated blurb and so seems to be involved editorialising. Andrew🐉(talk) 09:36, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I support having "marking the first known Israeli attack on the country", and therefore support Alt Blurb. I think the significance of why this is in the news matters. This is not "editorializing", given this is an objective and indisputable fact. There are so many sources calling this either "first", "first known" or "unprecedented": NPR, Politico, Al-Jazeera, CNN, Guardian, Sky News, USA Today, [8]Vox.VR (Please ping on reply) 11:03, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I've also joined in on the conversation about this in WP:ERRORS. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 14:52, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Post posting comment - It should say IN the country, not ON. They didnt attack Qatar. They attacked Hamas. Other than that, this is absolutely newsworthy. Metallurgist (talk) 18:28, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Post-posting support Targeting Hamas’ leaders during negotiations is notable enough for a blurb. However, the wording of the originally proposed blurb seems better to me. Blaylockjam10 (talk) 00:05, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Recent deaths of any person, animal or organism with a Wikipedia article are always presumed to be important enough to post (see this RFC and further discussion). Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article meets WP:ITNRD. 2601:406:4680:9A27:19AC:BD47:E67C:24D2 (talk) 20:48, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose on notability as a RD nomination, as Iryna Zarutska isn't notable independently of her murder and doesn't have a standalone page. Also oppose blurb – while the event has had some impact, it is far from the notability threshold we expect of a "death as the story" blurb. Additionally, the wording of the blurb should carefully take into account WP:BLPCRIME – our article still refers to the fare-jumper as "the suspect" rather than "the murderer". Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 21:01, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Note that this is currently at AFD (likely to be kept). However, oppose blurb as this is not significant enough for the main page. As with the mushroom case below, we generally do not post "local crime news". I doubt this is a good RD as well. Natg 19 (talk) 21:02, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose I can't even begin to fathom who the stabbing of a single transit rider is worth mentioning in any article - let alone ITN. Nfitz (talk) 21:05, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - somebody is killed while on transit - so what? EF5 21:07, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is a horrible crime and a tragedy, to be sure. However, as pointed out above, the killing of a single, otherwise non-notable person by another non-notable person is not the type of thing we usually post on ITN. Additionally, the murder itself is now technically stale because it happened back on August 22. Perhaps the story should instead be the release of the video on September 5. If there is very notable public outcry, for example along the lines of the Floyd protests, then we could hypothetically post that as a story, but I don't think the reaction so far rises to that level of significance. 98.170.164.88 (talk) 21:07, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose before I get crucified here, this crime is godawful and the person who did it (I'm not saying anyone per WP:BLP) should get whatever North Carolina's worst punishment is. However there are few crimes by strangers in the street that could ever be considered the biggest new story in the world. I don't think even the works of the worst serial killers, like Kemper, Bundy, etc, were the world's biggest new stories as they were happening. Unknown Temptation (talk) 21:29, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose, close, and remove the nomination as a BLP violation. I'm opposed anyway because the murder of a single private citizen, no matter how tragic, is not the stuff of ITN. But the headline makes a claim not proven in court. None of this should be here. (And bluntly, fare-dodging has nothing intrinsically to do with homicide - this is a weird framing, even leaving aside the obvious BLP problem.) GenevieveDEon (talk) 22:52, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support and comment: Major political change. This event looks similar as August 2025 Indonesian protests. Suppose to be they want there very peaceful, but tensions and chaos occur because of government corruption. But in this event, the government once proposed an indefinite/permanent ban on social media platforms. The methods itself looks similar to the previous event, which is quite depressing for the people and their own country.

Conviction already occurred in July which was the main story, so I oppose posting the sentencing of Patterson. (Do not think we posted the conviction however.) Also, though a sensational story, we generally do not post "local" crime stories. Natg 19 (talk) 01:31, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Not ready. The article is extremely detailed in describing the preparations, venues, qualification, format etc. But then it says absolutely nothing about what happened during the tournament, just a bunch of results tables with no prose at all. Lots of effort has been put into the parts that are nice but not vital, without writing the part that we actually need for ITN - at least one full referenced paragraph describing what happened during the tournament. Whoever wrote the rest of the article did a good job, so should be capable of fixing this easily enough. Modest Genius talk 18:14, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Sure, although it's hardly WP:IDONTLIKEIT (an essay, anyways) - it simply isn't notable enough in my opinion, although I'm an atheist and maybe am just missing something. EF5 14:23, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm referring to 128.x. but seems fair on your reason. ROY is WAR Talk! 14:25, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I know, I was just explaining my vote because I piggybacked off theirs. EF5 14:26, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
128.x here: I gave my reason: "Utterly pointless trivia".
To expand, rather unnecessarily in my opinion, because really, this is all quite obvious: I'm happy for Saint Carlo and all his supporters and all that, but the big deal seems to be that he was a millennial social-media-savvy teenager, which is certainly interesting, but just a detail along the way.
Better than clickbait, yes, in that it's real and, as I stated, interesting.
But I don't see ITN-level worthiness or relevance. 128.91.40.237 (talk) 14:44, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose, I agree it is interesting trivia, like the first millennial head of government, first millennial to win an Oscar, first millennial billionaire or the first person born in the 21st century to travel to space. Sahaib (talk) 14:58, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Not only on that being the first millennial being trivial, but also, canonization is not an infrequent event. Pope Leo here has only had a couple months but already has 9 (including the planned ones in October). Pope Francis had 130-some (this is considering the whole of the 800-member group Martyrs of Otranto as a single event to be fair) over his 11 years. Masem (t) 15:08, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose. Trivia without long-lasting significance. Better suited to DYK.  — Amakuru (talk) 15:41, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose attention-grabbing generation-baiting headline but in the long-run, as trivial as the other examples Sahaib brought up. The idea of generations as we know them is not universal (would World War 2's losers or non-participants have been prompted to have a baby boom?), and you can get a million different answers to where "millennial" starts and ends. See how your interest would wane if the headline was "first saint born after 1980". Unknown Temptation (talk) 16:11, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Comment. The term millenial, at least for me, is too unsharply defined to warrant attention as to make the canonisation notable. Is he the first person born in the 1990s to become a saint? Either way soft oppose. --Ouro (blah blah) 18:46, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Weak oppose per above. Let the DYK guys feast on this instead. TwistedAxe [contact] 23:52, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Pretty arbitrary, plenty of individuals are made saints in various religious organizations so having a millenial one isn't as unique as it is. Ornithoptera (talk) 00:47, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak support Although it is trivia, this is being covered by news organisations, and thus notable. It may be a better fit for DYK than ITN. As per Ouro, it may be better to define millennial more strictly. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 00:53, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose, wait until a new PM is appointed Trudeu is a bad precedent, Johnson is a bad precedent. We must cut it at some point.
_-_Alsor (talk) 11:25, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Is it a bad precedent? There's a difference between a highly prominent G7 leader who has been in power for near a decade, and/or had a very high profile before they became PM, and someone who has only been in power for months. It's what's in the news. And I see no mention of this in the morning papers. What's the timeframe for replacement? Nfitz (talk) 13:49, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It sets a bad precedent because it implies that simply announcing a resignation (which is what was posted in the case of Johnson and Trudeau) is a direct ticket to the Main Page, when it has no encyclopedic value, unlike the succession to the office of PM. We are not a breaking news portal and we should not get carried away by journalistic hyperventilation. Whether someone govern for two months or 15 years.
_-_Alsor (talk) 17:25, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Surely Pierre Trudeau's February 29th 1984 announcement of his intention to resign remains more notable than the events of his replacement and ultimate. Nfitz (talk) 21:49, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose with the waits. They will hold an emergency election to select his replacement, he will continue to serve as PM until then. That election makes sense to post as the standard ITNR. Masem (t) 12:47, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Updated and nominated by 1brianm7 (talk · give credit)
Article updatedRecent deaths of any person, animal or organism with a Wikipedia article are always presumed to be important enough to post (see this RFC and further discussion). Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article meets WP:ITNRD.Nominator's comments: Internet famous cat, had previously held the Guinness World Record for most YouTube video views of an individual animal. Death announcement is currently only a primary source (his owner). 1brianm7 (talk) 00:47, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose until we get some secondary sources. CREditzWiki, editor (talk) 13:37, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
To clarify, do you mean until secondary sources report on his death or are you opposed because the article is sourced too much from primary sources? I have removed two uncited paragraphs and added two cited paragraphs in their place since you made this reply. If its the former, I haven't heard of any such requirement (though this is my first ITN Nom, so I could be wrong), and if its the latter, I believe the article is mostly sourced and at present the only things that might not be suitably sourced are "During the two-week trial period, Maru and Hana got along very well and Hana began to appear in videos on the mugumogu channel" and "... but only in Japanese." 1brianm7 (talk) 16:59, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We would want actual news coverage of the cat's death, not from a primary source, to show this is "in the news". Masem (t) 17:22, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I only see it being reliably sourced (I would say this counts, a secondary source wouldn't be able to do more to substantiate than listen to the owner), not the publication of obituaries, as a requirement. 1brianm7 (talk) 17:43, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
per WP:ITNRD, while the death of a notable cat is something we can post, and there's no major issues with the article itself, we need the article to be "Updated, including reliably sourced confirmation of their death." Primary sources are not reliable for this purpose. It may take a day or so for this news to filter to actual news sites, as I'm aware of Maru's popularity on the Internet. Masem (t) 17:51, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
From the cat's owner is one thing. I myself have not seen much outside coverage on this (though maybe I just need to look further). CREditzWiki, editor (talk) 12:58, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I’ve stumbled upon posts from fans in the Maru and online cat spheres, but I haven’t found an online obituary yet. Supposedly it may take a few days, though I don’t really see the problem with pre-empting it, besides 1brianm7 (talk) 13:10, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose most of the sourcing for the article does not meet WP:RS, as they're Youtube sources with some links to Amazon for the books about Maru. As such does not meet WP:ITNQUALITY. Joseph2302 (talk) 07:23, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I would disagree that most of the sourcing does not meet RS. The two sentences about Maru’s siblings, her death, the Freshsteps (which I will soon remove found source), and the second book. Everybody agrees the two formers are accurate (will look for better sources), and I am struggling to find an English source talking about a book only published in Japan. I think it will meet ITNQuality once I have the time to edit it. 1brianm7 (talk) 13:14, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Everything in the fame section is now cited, except for the fact that Keyboard Cat and Nora were in the EW video, I'll look for a source on that. 1brianm7 (talk) 13:32, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support from nominator As of right now, everything in the article is adequately sourced. The only non-independent sources are from Maru's owner's blog and they are to support the fact that she had adopted two other cats who lived with Maru, and of course to support the fact that Maru has passed. I do not believe there are any ITN quality concerns, and I plan on adding another paragraph or two from reliable sources later today. I think that there is no need to wait for an independent obituary to be published. (I forgot to sign this initially) 1brianm7 (talk) 17:22, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Guinness has published an obituary, I've added it tot the article. 1brianm7 (talk) 17:22, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@CREditzWiki @Joseph2302 The article is now entirely sourced to reliable sources and the death has been covered in Guinness and People, both reliable secondary sources. At present, two YT videos are cited because the article states how many views those videos have received, a video from Guinness is cited, though all of its content is also cited to their text obituary. The only claims cited to primary sources are that Maru's owner adopted two other cats and said one of them got along with Maru. I am uncomfortable removing them, since much of the reaction from fans I have seen is sympathy for those two cats. Are there any outstanding objections to the article appearing in RD? 1brianm7 (talk) 23:53, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Impressed. Changing my vote to support. Well done! CREditzWiki, editor (talk) 01:04, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
