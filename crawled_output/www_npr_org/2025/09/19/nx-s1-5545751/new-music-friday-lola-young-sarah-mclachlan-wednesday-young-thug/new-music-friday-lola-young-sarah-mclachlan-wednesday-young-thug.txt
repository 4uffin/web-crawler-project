It's Friday, which unfortunately does not guarantee good tidings these days. Whether the unpredictability leaves you longing for a calm escape or craving a good scream into nothingness, today's new music has you covered. If you're looking for the former, Stephen Thompson and Kyle Meredith from Louisville Public Media dive into Kentucky's own tranquil and familiar Joan Shelley and her soothing new album, Real Warmth. And if it's the latter you're after, they wax praise for alt-country band Wednesday and their crunchy, cathartic and beautifully mundane, Bleeds. Hear our hosts crack open these two albums, as well as Sarah McLachlan's nostalgic return and a few more standouts wherever you get your podcasts, and make sure to scroll down for the complete list of today's best albums.
