President Trump's administration continues to ramp up deportations of undocumented people across the country. These expanded efforts include the Department of Homeland Security's recent announcement of an immigration enforcement operation in Illinois and an immigration raid on a battery plant in Georgia last week. NPR wants to hear from listeners whose lives have changed due to an increase in ICE operations. Have you been more hesitant to leave your home in fear of getting stopped by agents? Are you carrying around additional documentation for proof of citizenship? Share your experience with us, and you could be featured in a radio piece for Morning Edition.
