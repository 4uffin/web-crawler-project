New study raises questions about effectiveness of wolf hunting as a tool to help ranchers

How the largest daily migration on Earth stores carbon in the ocean
July 28, 2025 • The twilight zone of the ocean is a mysterious place. At 200-1000 meters below the surface, it's a tough place to study. That's why, during World War II, people reading sonograms from this zone were perplexed when it looked as if the ocean floor was moving up. Every day. And then back down again before dawn. In this latest installment of Sea Camp, we explore what this historical mystery has to do with the Earth's ability to cycle and store carbon in the ocean's watery depths.

Did spiders' ancestors come from the ocean?
July 25, 2025 • Whether you love spiders or can't be within 10 feet of them, you probably think of them crawling around on land. Historically, most researchers would probably say the same thing: Based on the fossil record, they've thought the earliest arachnid ancestors existed around 450 million years ago, living and diversifying exclusively on land. But a new study out this week in the journal Current Biology suggests arachnid brains may have originated much earlier in the ocean.

Short Wave: Sea Camp
COMIC: Exploring the ocean's wonderous, mysterious depths
July 21, 2025 • Scientists are far from knowing all of the complexities of Earth's ocean. With this comic, we explore some of what scientists do know, like its role as one of the world's largest carbon sinks and how life changes as the waters get deeper.
Many invertebrates living in the sunlight zone of the ocean have "superpowers," as marine biologist Drew Harvell calls them: They can regenerate limbs, are especially strong or can even steal the abilities of other animals.

Here, we zoom in on some spineless inhabitants envied for their "superpowers." Marine biologist Drew Harvell tells us about stealthy sea slugs, sea stars with super strength and life-saving sponges.
