Set List "Ancient Light""Wild and Clear and Blue""Sisters of the Night Watch""Call My Name""Find My Way to You"
Bluegrass trio I'm With Her formed sort of by accident.
Aoife O'Donovan, Sara Watkins and Sarah Jarosz — each talented musicians with their own projects — were asked to play a slot at the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival at the very last minute. The chemistry was instant and powerful. They went on to win a Grammy Award in 2020 for their song "Call My Name."
Then they took a break to work on other creative endeavors. In today's session, you'll hear how I'm With Her regrouped in 2021 and how that led to their second full-length album, Wild and Clear and Blue. This episode of World Cafe was produced and edited by Kimberly Junod and Will Loftus. The web story was created by Miguel Perez. Our engineer is Chris Williams and our programming and booking coordinator is Chelsea Johnson.
