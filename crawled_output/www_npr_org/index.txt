Utah files murder charges against Tyler Robinson
Anna Corrigan poses for a portrait at the Tuam graveyard on July 14, 2025. This is a few hundred meters from the site of one of Ireland's so-called mother and baby homes — institutions for unmarried mothers and their children. This one was run by the Bon Secours religious order. For years, Corrigan has sought answers about the fate of her two missing siblings, who were born at the institution. Nestled in the west of Ireland, Tuam gained international attention in the past decade after local amateur historian Catherine Corless uncovered records documenting the deaths of 796 children at the home. Her research suggested that most of the children were buried in an unmarked, unregistered site on the grounds of the former institution. After years of relentless pressure from survivors and family members, excavations to recover and identify the remains began in July 2025.
