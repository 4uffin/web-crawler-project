San Diego-based trio Thee Sacred Souls made its mark at the Tiny Desk with satin vocals and vintage melodies. Paying homage to southern California Latino culture meeting American soul roots, the group's sweet fusion melodies brought history and love into the space. The trio opened the concert with "Will I See You Again?," which tells the tale of a confused, forlorn lover with soft, harmony-laden lyrics and bouncy guitar and bass. Lead singer Josh Lane then pauses to share a message of love, the kind the band is focused on consistently extending. "Love Is The Way" paints a picturesque image of a sweet, timeless love fit to be celebrated top-down out the back of a low-rider. "Easier Said than Done" brings more reflective energy atop floaty high harmonies from Tiny Desk veteran Astyn Turr. With a transition to a horns-adorned "Love Comes Easy," the band hits even more of a groove before ending with the easy-listening "Can I Call You Rose?" The band brought what it does best: great melodies, romantic lyrics and a vibe that fills any space it plays with light and tranquility, fit for any era.
