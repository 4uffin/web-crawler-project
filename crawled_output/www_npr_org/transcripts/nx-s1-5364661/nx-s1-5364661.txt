MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Let's go back in time to 1989 - that's when movie-goers first met the dopey but adorable time-traveling headbangers Bill and Ted.(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE")ALEX WINTER: (As Bill) Socrates. Hey, we know that name.KEANU REEVES: (As Ted) Yeah, look him up. It's under Socrates.WINTER: (As Bill) Oh, yeah.MARTIN: "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" put actors Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter on the map.(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE")WINTER: (As Bill) Socrates - the only true wisdom consists in knowing that you know nothing.REEVES: (As Ted) That's us, dude.MARTIN: The actors became and have remained close friends. A few years ago, Keanu Reeves had an idea - why not stage a production of "Waiting For Godot," and let's do it together on Broadway? Well, it's happening right now. They just started preview performances this weekend.(SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, "WAITING FOR GODOT")WINTER: (As Vladimir) What are you doing?REEVES: (As Estragon) Taking off my boot. Did that never happen to you?WINTER: (As Vladimir) Boots are supposed to be taken off every day. I'm tired of telling you that.REEVES: (As Estragon) Help me.WINTER: (As Vladimir)
It hurts?REEVES: (As Estragon) Hurts? He wants to know if it hurts.WINTER: (As Vladimir) No one ever suffers but you. I don't count. I'd like to hear what you'd say if you had what I have.REEVES: (As Estragon) It hurts?WINTER: (As Vladimir) Hurts. He wants to know if it hurts.MARTIN: That's Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter recorded just after their first day rehearsing at the Hudson Theatre, where the breathtaking set had just been completed. Sorry, no spoilers. You'll just have to see it. Now, Winter has some Broadway experience under his belt, but for Reeves, this is a first.WINTER: Today, in fact.MARTIN: Today?(LAUGHTER)REEVES: That's right.WINTER: This is your very first day on a Broadway stage was today.REEVES: That's awesome.MARTIN: Any nerves?REEVES: Absolutely. Terror.WINTER: No, I don't believe that.REEVES: Anxiety. Hope. Looking forward to it...(LAUGHTER)REEVES: ...Said the person who has, you know, no idea what they're talking about.(LAUGHTER)REEVES: Can't wait.MARTIN: Now, in case you weren't a theater kid in school, "Waiting For Godot" is a surrealist play by Samuel Beckett that's more than 70 years old. And yes, Beckett scholars insist he pronounced it Gadot (ph) not Godot. It's about all sorts of things - faith and patience and the mysteries of our existence as two friends wait for Godot, who may never show up. Alex Winter is Vladimir, also called Didi. Keanu Reeves is Estragon or Gogo. I asked Reeves, why this play?REEVES: I don't know. I first asked Alex if he wanted to do the play about three years ago.WINTER: Three and a half.MARTIN: What sparked it?REEVES: The universe.MARTIN: (Laughter).REEVES: I was in a hotel room. I was thinking about, like, what Alex and I could work on again. And then it just struck me, "Waiting For Godot." And then I FaceTimed him, and I think you said yes.WINTER: I did, yeah. I mean, he and I had been talking about trying to find something to do together that wasn't Bill and Ted.MARTIN: Did you know each other before Bill and Ted?WINTER: No, we met at the audition. Yeah.MARTIN: Did you like each other immediately?WINTER: We became friends pretty early on.MARTIN: What do you like about Keanu?(LAUGHTER)WINTER: What do you mean? Just, like, in a...MARTIN: Well, that's what I - when I...WINTER: I mean, I've known this guy almost 40 years, so like...MARTIN: Yeah, well, what do you like? Presumably, you should have an answer after all this time, right?WINTER: I mean, not really. Not a - it's gotten less concrete over the years...MARTIN: (Laughter).WINTER: ...But I mean, there's so many things about him as a friend that I like, you know. So trust...REEVES: We enjoy each other's...MARTIN: Yeah, Keanu, what do you like about him?REEVES: ...Sense of humor and...WINTER: Yeah.REEVES: ...Company and we have similar tastes in things.WINTER: Yeah.REEVES: So we end up landing on talking about film or books or art or life.MARTIN: It's a great play for people who have a relationship or partners because it's about a lot of things. It's about pretty much anything you think it could be about, but it is a great play for somebody who has a strong working relationship with someone because there's so much to play off it. But tell me a bit more if you would...REEVES: Yeah, I mean...MARTIN: ...About why this play.REEVES: You know, I'd read it when I was a teen, and, you know, there was a certain sequence of let's go. We can't. Why not? We're waiting for Godot, that stuck with me. And I - over the years, I had seen Robin Williams and Steve Martin do their production. I saw Nathan Lane. You know, I loved the play live, and just the riches of the text and the themes are profound - Why? How? What? Tragic comedy.MARTIN: Does it feel different to you, having experienced it again as an adult? Because I know I saw the play first when I was a teenager. But as a man of some years, does it feel different?REEVES: 61.MARTIN: Does it feel different?WINTER: Yeah, you know, the...MARTIN: Alex?WINTER: To do it now, like, to do it as two people with a lot more life experience and then speaking personally 'cause he would say the same thing about his own life (laughter), like, having experienced a lot of highs and lows and loss and things that - the play is a lot more personal. There's an immediacy to the play right now that we can lean into. I think...MARTIN: Say more about that.WINTER: It's a very emotional play to do, as you've lived life, and you stand on that stage, and you're both with a friend you've known a very long time and just all the life that's happened to you that the play is about. And in some ways, they're running away from that pain, these two guys. They're constantly - that's the whole kind of joke of "Waiting For Godot," is this constant distraction, distraction, distraction from the immediate present. And the immediate present is not great, and, you know, we're in an interesting time.MARTIN: Who's going to save us? Are we going to save us?WINTER: Yeah.MARTIN: What are we going to do about it?WINTER: Yeah.MARTIN: Power.WINTER: Yeah. Sure, yeah.MARTIN: And the abuse of power.WINTER: Yeah. And what is our...MARTIN: People forget - I think you kind of forget, like, with the comedy of it, and then there's some really painful things.WINTER: Yeah, though, I don't - when you're performing it, you don't, right?MARTIN: Right.WINTER: Because it's actually not that funny. It is fun. It has pace. It has rhythm. It's got this beautiful musicality to the way we interrelate and physicality. But it is about very serious things most of the time.MARTIN: So you know perfectly well that some people are going to expect to see some Bill and Tedness in this. Are Bill and Ted making an appearance?REEVES: We did not quite, but we have an homage.WINTER: We have an homage.MARTIN: (Laughter).WINTER: We have a momentary homage.REEVES: We have an homage.WINTER: Yeah.MARTIN: OK.WINTER: Yeah.MARTIN: I'm intrigued.WINTER: We're just similar to Bill and Ted, which is funny to me. Bill thinks he knows what's going on and has no idea. Ted doesn't think he has any idea what's going on, but he actually does know what's going on. It's exactly the same in this play.MARTIN: One of the things that interesting casting does is it brings people to it who otherwise might not be interested in it.WINTER: Yeah.MARTIN: And so one of the things I was wondering is, do you think you might be bringing people to this who might otherwise not find it?REEVES: I mean, I think I can speak on your behalf on this.WINTER: Yes.MARTIN: Please do.REEVES: We certainly hope so.WINTER: We do. Yeah, very much so.MARTIN: You do?WINTER: Yes.REEVES: Absolutely. Yeah.WINTER: Yes, yes. We want people to come see it who don't know Beckett and don't know the play. And - yeah, and if they come because of Bill and Ted, great.MARTIN: That's Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter. They are in a new production of "Waiting For Godot" at the Hudson Theatre on Broadway. You have until January 4 to catch them. Gentlemen, thank you both so much.WINTER: Thank you so much.REEVES: Thank you.WINTER: Really appreciate it.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
