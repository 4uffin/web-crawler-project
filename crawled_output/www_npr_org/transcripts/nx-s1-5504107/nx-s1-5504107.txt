STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
You know, NPR is the network that takes you all across America, including rural Texas, where high school football is king. Now, you've heard about how big football can be in Texas with multimillion-dollar stadiums and so forth. But in small towns, sometimes there are not enough players to send a traditional 11-person team onto the field. Reporter Carlos Morales takes us to rural West Texas, where six-man football is a way of life.UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) Let's go, defense. Let's go.(SOUNDBITE OF CLAPPING)CARLOS MORALES: It's the end of the school week in Marfa. And even in Texas' rural pockets, that means one thing - Friday night lights. But this isn't your typical game. This is six-man football.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Shouting) Take it. Take it.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Shouting) Go, go, go, go.(SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE BLOWING)JAY FOSTER: It's not like 11-man ball, but you still have the basics.MORALES: Jay Foster, who coached football here, has seen generations of fans work their way into the stands to cheer on their Marfa Shorthorns. In Texas' small towns, schools like Marfa with fewer than a hundred and five students can opt to play this small-town version of the game.FOSTER: Still got to block and tackle. You got to run. You got to pass. You got to kick.MORALES: This gridiron game some 200 teams play in Texas is distinct in a few ways. The field is shorter - just 80 yards long instead of a hundred. Field goals are worth four points instead of three, and there's even a mercy rule. But why six man? The sport was born during the Great Depression and provided kids with an opportunity to play football in places where there weren't enough players to put a traditional team on the field. And it has become popular in small communities.FOSTER: Even though you've got your loyal fans in your big school, your small schools sometimes, to me, they're even more rabid about their team.MORALES: And tonight's season opener against a private school from El Paso nearly 200 miles away has brought out that passionate fan base.(SOUNDBITE OF DRUM BEATING)UNIDENTIFIED CHEERLEADERS: (Chanting) Go win again (ph). Go win again.MORALES: Between crunching tackles and breathless sprints to the end zone, the school's cheerleaders and a mascot named Bullette (ph) lead a crowd full of family and friends in chants.BOBBIE BROWN: It's like an identity.MORALES: Bobbie Brown is with 1A Fan, a website she founded to cover six-man football and the students attending some of the least populated schools in Texas.BROWN: In small towns, there's really not a lot to do. The school is the hub for the community. And we know what we're doing on Friday nights in the fall.MORALES: In Marfa, the high school's enrollment has been trending downward for years now. And some worry the student population may get so low that one day they won't even be able to field a six-man team.LORI FLORES: I can't even fathom that ever happening.MORALES: Like so many here, Lori Flores attended Marfa High School, and so did her parents and her kids, too. She says she can't imagine her life without shorthorn football.FLORES: We would all be heartbroken. A lot would be lost.MORALES: On the field after a recent game, Garry Webb is embracing his family. The senior transferred from a neighboring district where he was the only high school student in his class. But now, even in tiny Marfa, he feels like he's found a community on the field and in the stands.GARRY WEBB: We see our parents, our cousins, our old teammates. And what they see down here is not just, you know, a number, a player. They see my little brother, my cousin, you know, my old friend that I used to play with.MORALES: For Webb, playing under Friday night lights in Texas is a rite of passage. And one way or another, even if it's the six-man version, he just had to experience it.WEBB: It just feels like the world's watching. Not the entire world, but our world.MORALES: With his helmet in hand, Webb heads to the locker room after a shorthorn victory. On a Friday night during football season, this town wouldn't be anywhere else but the stands, rooting for their Marfa Shorthorns.For NPR News, I'm Carlos Morales reporting from Martin Field in Marfa, Texas.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
