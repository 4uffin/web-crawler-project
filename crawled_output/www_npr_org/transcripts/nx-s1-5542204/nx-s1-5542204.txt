LEILA FADEL, HOST:
We have the latest in the tug-of-war between the Trump administration and schools it's investigating over allegations of antisemitism. Investigations critics say weaponize the real issue of bigotry, to suppress academic freedoms on college campuses. Now, the University of California, Berkeley, is handing over files and names to the federal government.It informed about 160 faculty, staff and students this month that their names were included in records the school gave to the Department of Education. Among them is history professor Ussama Makdisi.USSAMA MAKDISI: I was shocked and I felt dismayed, as I think most people would be, and we felt a fundamental and breathtaking breach of trust and fairness.FADEL: In a statement to NPR, university spokesperson Janet Gilmore confirmed that records of complaints relating to, quote, "alleged incidents of antisemitism and discrimination" were provided to the Trump administration. I asked Makdisi what effect the move is having on campus.MAKDISI: The idea is obviously clearly a chilling of speech and a chilling of academic freedom because, of course, we have no idea what we have allegedly been accused of. We have no idea how to even go about clearing our name.FADEL: How much do you think this has to do with what you teach? I mean, you teach history. You touch on the Israel-Palestine conflict. You've criticized Israeli policies.MAKDISI: I teach Palestinian history. I teach Middle Eastern history. I teach Arab history. And, of course, this has to do with, I mean, what's happening across American institutions and across the United States more generally is a crackdown, an unprecedented crackdown, on academic freedom, on the ability of students to express themselves in support of various, very basic and fundamental issues, such as freedom, such as equality, such as justice for Palestinians in particular.FADEL: A campus spokesperson for Berkeley told us it wasn't a, quote, "list of names per se." Rather, the Department of Education is investigating how Berkeley handles allegations of antisemitism. The University of California had a legal obligation to cooperate. It sent documents and it informed people if their names were in the documents.So this is what they told us, and then said, quote, "we are committed to transparency and supporting our campus community while complying with federal investigations." What do you think of that statement?MAKDISI: I mean, let's see what happens. I mean, what can I say? I mean, that is going to be in their statements. All I can say is that when you have sort of information that's been turned over to an administration that has actively persecuted students across this country for the fact that they have expressed themselves, and you know, and in almost every case, in fact, these students, as far as I'm aware, the cases against them didn't hold up.FADEL: As a historian, does this moment remind you of any other time in history?MAKDISI: Yes, it reminds me of the McCarthyis period and it reminds me of the Salem witch trials, it reminds me of all sorts of things as a historian. But the difference, of course, is that this is all happening in the context of what is going on in Gaza. There is a genocide taking place in Gaza. Now, again, the point of a university, ideally, is that we can come and we can have a discussion.We can debate what, you know, the history and points about history, the points about politics, points about policy. And that is exactly what is under threat right now.FADEL: And what happens if there is not a free exchange of ideas on campus, if that changes?MAKDISI: I mean, we're going to find out very soon. We are in a crisis moment right now.FADEL: And I will say, I mean, you mentioned genocide. The United Nations, a commission of inquiry just concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, but it's something Israel still denies. Are you surprised that Berkeley, of all places, with its reputation as this sort of bastion of liberalism and exchange of free ideas, is handling the investigation this way?MAKDISI: I think Berkeley administration, you know, is under huge pressure. It's quite clear. On the other hand, yes, I am dismayed by what has happened to our students. I'm dismayed by what's happening to the campus climate, in terms of being able to speak out about basic issues. We should all be able to teach our subject matters with freedom and without censorship.And, of course, every student should have the right to learn without censorship and with freedom. It's as simple as that.FADEL: Ussama Makdisi is a professor of history at the University of California at Berkeley. Thank you so much for your time.MAKDISI: You're very welcome.
