MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Charlie Kirk's assassination has ignited a fierce debate over how he should be honored, but also whether he should be honored at all. Some say, even as the nation deplores the violence that took Kirk's life, that Kirk's public statements still merit public critique - statements such as calling Martin Luther King Jr., quote, "awful" or calling for a Nuremberg-style trial for every gender-affirming clinic doctor or broadly questioning the, quote, "brain processing power" of a number of prominent and accomplished Black women.But others are seeking serious consequences for people who they think seem to justify the murder in some way. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the government is working to revoke visas for people, quote, "celebrating" Kirk's death. The Florida Department of Education said it would investigate teachers who make, quote, "disgusting comments" about it. And Republican lawmakers have singled out people to lose their jobs over social media posts about Kirk's death, claiming the political left is broadly celebrating it. All this has some asking whether the murder of Kirk, as horrifying as it is, is being used to undermine political discourse and political dissent. Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat from Connecticut, is among those who's concerned. He's with us now. Good morning, Senator.CHRIS MURPHY: Good morning.MARTIN: You posted a message on X over the weekend saying, quote, "pay attention. Something dark might be coming," unquote. What did you mean by that?MURPHY: Well, as we are all reeling over the assassination of Charlie Kirk and this broader increase in political violence, this was an opportunity in the wake of the assassination for the president to try to bring the country together around the work we need to do to try to make sure that violence is unacceptable in any circumstance, but he seems to be doing the opposite, as your reporter noted. They are readying what may be a dizzying, high-volume attack on the president's political opponents, essentially exploiting the death of Charlie Kirk to try to eliminate those who are trying to politically stand in opposition to the president's agenda.And I think that that could be a really dark time for this country if mainstream progressive organizations are, you know, just labeled as terrorists or as inciters of violence simply because they are working to undermine the president's political agenda. You know, this has been ongoing work for the administration for the last nine months. They've been doing it at smaller scale, but they now may be readying to ramp up and attempt to really, truly do significant damage to our democracy, and we have to be watchful for it.MARTIN: Is it possible that this - the heat of the moment, that as our colleagues have been pointing out in their reporting, Charlie Kirk is somebody who had some very close relationships with some of the people in this White House - is it possible that this is the emotion of the moment?MURPHY: I mean, that may be true, but I think it's also straight out of the totalitarian's playbook. If you look at other societies where you had an elected leader that decided that they wanted to rule forever, they end up trying to cast and label their political opposition as instigators of violence. So you have, I think, seen all of the ways in which the Trump administration has watched what's happened in places like Turkey and Hungary and copied it - their attacks on the legal profession, their attacks on higher education. This would be a tactic that is not new or unique. It's another mechanism that other would-be autocrats have tried to use to destroy and shut down their political opposition groups.MARTIN: So how are you advising people to prepare for that? What do you think people should do?MURPHY: Well, I mean, listen; first, it is important for us to recognize and say that political violence is unacceptable. We don't yet know the full motives of this shooter, but there have been political assassination and political assassination attempts that are due to right-wing radicalism and left-wing radicalism, and there should be no one in this country and no one on the left, that is celebrating what happened here. But second, it's just a moment where we have to show the president and his team that we are not going to be bullied into submission. That means that, you know, this is a moment for Americans who haven't signed up to join one of these protest groups to do it, for them to support groups that are trying to save our democracy. What the president is going to try to do by going after either the Soros-funded groups or attacking more high-profile politicians that oppose him is to, you know, try to convince people to stay on the sidelines, and we've got to show him that that tactic is not going to work.MARTIN: Before Charlie Kirk was killed, a White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, pointed to how you said in an interview that Democrats were essentially, quote, at a war "to save this country." She was making the point that she thinks that Democrats have contributed to this environment of heightened tensions. Do you think Democrats should change the way they talk about some of these issues as well? Does she have a point, basically?MURPHY: Well, if you look at the question I was being asked, it was a question about the Republicans' effort to destroy bipartisan redistricting. And I said, yeah, we have a fight on our hands right now to make sure that we can have fair elections in this country. So it is true that politicians on both sides use heated rhetoric when talking about policy fights.MARTIN: OK, but in fairness...MURPHY: But none of us...MARTIN: ...Do you think there's something you need to do differently when you expressed yourself on issues like this to lower the temperature?MURPHY: Well, none of us, including what I said during that interview, comes close to an endorsement or an incitement of violence. And I think this is an attempt by Republicans to try to distract this country from the campaign that they are readying to try to undermine legitimate dissent.MARTIN: That is Senator Chris Murphy. He's a Democrat of Connecticut. Senator Murphy, thanks so much for sharing some insights with us.MURPHY: Appreciate it.
