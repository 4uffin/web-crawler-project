AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Today is a pretty remarkable day if you are into math, like reporter Ari Daniel is - who says we only get a day like this once every hundred years. Well, we made him show his work.ARI DANIEL, BYLINE: Colin Adams is a mathematician at Williams College, who first told me of the multiple reasons that make today - 9/16/25 - so special.COLIN ADAMS: The first is that all three of the entries in that date are perfect squares. And what I mean by that is nine is just equal to three squared, 16 is equal to four squared, and 25 is equal to five squared.DANIEL: Plus, those perfect squares come from consecutive numbers - three, four and five.ADAMS: And that's more special.DANIEL: But perhaps most special of all is that three, four and five are an example of a Pythagorean triple.ADAMS: And what that means is that if I take the sum of the squares of the first two numbers - three squared plus four squared, which is nine, plus 16, is equal to 25, which is five squared. So three squared plus four squared equals five squared.DANIEL: Sound familiar? This is the Pythagorean theorem - A squared plus B squared equals C squared.ADAMS: The most famous theorem in all of mathematics.DANIEL: It's a theorem that also means something geometrically. Any Pythagorean triple, including three, four and five, also gives you the lengths of three sides of a right triangle. There are no other dates this century that meet all these conditions, so most of us will experience it just once in our lifetime.ADAMS: If it were me making it up, I would call it Pythagorean Triple Square Day.DANIEL: Adams plans on celebrating with a rectangular cake cut along the diagonal to yield two right triangles.ADAMS: Probably in the middle we'll put the date - 9/16/25.TERRENCE BLACKMAN: This date is hiding one of the most beautiful coincidences we will ever encounter. Those numbers, they tell a story that goes back to ancient Greece.DANIEL: Terrence Blackman chairs the math department at Medgar Evers College. He says the Pythagorean theorem is used all the time by carpenters and architects. But for him, as a mathematician, today's date captures a special elegance.BLACKMAN: It reveals some kind of hidden mathematical poetry that is sitting there. Just like walking and coming upon a beautiful flower.DANIEL: Blackman says that in a world that can feel chaotic, a day like today reminds us that math can be a source of comfort.BLACKMAN: It reminds us that beauty and meaning can be found anywhere and everywhere, and we just have to continue to look for it.DANIEL: For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel.(SOUNDBITE OF ALCYNOOS & ALBERTO DROGUETT'S "ATARAXIA")
