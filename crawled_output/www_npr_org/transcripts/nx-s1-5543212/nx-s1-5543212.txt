A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:
Four in 10 American Jews say they've personally experienced antisemitism in the past two years. A new study finds that most disapprove of the Trump administration withholding funding from colleges and universities to address anti-Jewish sentiment. NPR religion correspondent Jason DeRose reports it's the first survey to dig into the views of Jewish Americans on one of Trump's biggest public battles.JASON DEROSE, BYLINE: The poll of more than 1,100 American Jews found that 72% are concerned about antisemitism on campus. But the study found that nearly 6 in 10 Jewish Americans disapprove of the Trump administration withholding federal funding to Harvard and UCLA for not doing enough to stop campus antisemitism. University of Rochester political scientist James Druckman is concerned Trump is using Jews as leverage to crack down on free speech and academic freedom, and he's not alone.JAMES DRUCKMAN: Three-fourths of the sample view the administration as using antisemitism as an excuse.DEROSE: Druckman helped formulate the study's questions along with researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the polling firm Ipsos. While there's been debate within the Jewish community about antisemitism on college campuses, there's a lot of agreement about what's happening now. Becca Israel is with The Nexus Project, an organization that fights antisemitism by promoting democracy.BECCA ISRAEL: The weaponization of these legitimate concerns for unrelated political goals as evidenced by Trump cutting the very Office of Civil Rights (ph) that investigates antisemitism while claiming to fight it, I think that really represents a dangerous distraction.DEROSE: The Trump administration has reached agreements related to antisemitism accusations with Colombia and Brown, among others. It's still negotiating with additional universities, including Harvard. The poll also found that a minority, just 31% of American Jews, approve of Israel's military campaign in Gaza over the last two years.Jason DeRose, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
