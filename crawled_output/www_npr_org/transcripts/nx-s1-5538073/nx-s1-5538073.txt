STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Google is supposed to share some of its data on what people search for online with its competitors. That's according to a federal judge's recent ruling in an antitrust case. Tech and privacy experts are wondering what that means for user privacy. NPR's Jaclyn Diaz has more on what's at stake. And we'll just note - Google is a financial supporter of NPR and we cover it like any other company.JACLYN DIAZ, BYLINE: Judge Amit Mehta's decision was meant to punish Google for holding a monopoly in the search engine market. The goal of sharing this user search data is to give other companies a chance at competing with this multitrillion-dollar company.BETSY COOPER: Data is the currency upon which this entire ecosystem was created, and it's the currency upon which Google built its wealth. And so now you're seeing a redistribution of that currency to other competitors.DIAZ: Betsy Cooper is a cybersecurity expert and the director of the Aspen Institute's Policy Academy. But like other tech experts, she wonders about the ethical implications for Google users who never intended for their data to be used by a company other than, well, Google.COOPER: The surprise now is that Google is going to share that data with other companies that are then going to be able to use that data for purposes we never imagined.DIAZ: Google already shares some aggregated user information with advertisers or business partners. That could include search trends or how often people use Google. But the big deal here is that now Google has to give other companies a look at what's called click-and-query data. When you type something into Google, like Italian restaurants or weather near me, that is the query data, and the results you click on are the click data.JONATHAN STRAY: So there are privacy concerns here.DIAZ: Because that data can be really sensitive, says Jonathan Stray. He's a senior scientist at UC Berkeley's Center for Human-Compatible AI.STRAY: So say a user searches for a rare disease.DIAZ: That search could be potentially linked to their IP address, essentially a digital address of a computer or phone connected to the web. It could give away their city or even which part of the city they live in.STRAY: Well, if you know what the disease was and you know where they were, you may be able to match that with news articles or potentially other information to figure out who they were.DIAZ: In his ruling, Judge Mehta used the same example to acknowledge the risks to user privacy. The Justice Department and Google both declined interviews for the story, but they both have recognized these data privacy risks. Still, the Justice Department and Judge Mehta say there are ways to protect users' identities. Mehta ordered a five-person technical oversight committee to decide which companies can get this data and how to keep it safe. Here's Cooper again.COOPER: The technical committee is going to have a ton of power, and who sits on that committee is going to make a huge difference in the outcomes on data privacy, on what gets shared and on the competitive issues here in this case.DIAZ: But it's still not clear who will be chosen for the committee or when their work will begin. And Google is expected to appeal the ruling, which could delay all of these decisions for a long time.Jaclyn Diaz, NPR News.
