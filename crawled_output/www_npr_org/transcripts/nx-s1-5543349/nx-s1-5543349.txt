A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:
President Trump is in the U.K., where he's on a state visit.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Which means a big ceremonial appearance, hanging with royals and so forth. And he's the only president ever to get this twice.MARTÍNEZ: NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is in London. So, Danielle, what will he be up to while he's in England?DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Well, there are really two parts to this visit. There's the spectacle part, and there's the policy part. Now, today is all about the royal spectacle. There's the carriage ride planned around the Windsor Castle grounds - weather permitting. There are going to be military bands. And tonight, there's a big banquet at Windsor Castle with the king and the queen.MARTÍNEZ: Now, Trump's mom was born in the U.K. - Scotland - and he's - it seems like he always felt a fondness for the place. I got to imagine he's very excited.KURTZLEBEN: It sure seems like it. Now, talking to reporters ahead of the trip yesterday, he said it would be a beautiful event, a good time. He was pretty effusive. And all of that makes sense. Like you mentioned, his mom was born here, and over the years, he's talked a lot about how she loved Queen Elizabeth. And when he met her in 2019, he seemed to be in awe in a way he really isn't about anyone else. And earlier this year, when Trump met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, he was also really complimentary about King Charles.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A great guy, great person. He looks really well. To me, he looks great. So we look forward to coming over. It's going to be a - it's - it was one of the most beautiful evenings I've ever seen. I hate to say, but nobody does it like you people in terms of...UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yeah.TRUMP: ...The pomp and ceremony.MARTÍNEZ: All right, so that was the spectacle part. You mentioned earlier, a second more policy-focused part of this trip. When does that happen?KURTZLEBEN: Well, that comes on Thursday, but it's not entirely separate from the pomp part of it. The serious part of this trip goes hand in hand with the spectacle. As one U.K. foreign policy expert told me, the thinking here is to use Trump's clear love of the monarchy to try to leverage him on these other issues. So tomorrow, Trump is headed to Chequers, the prime minister's country residence. He's meeting with Starmer there, and they're going to meet with some CEOs to talk about U.S. investing in the U.K. And the two countries will sign what they're calling a tech prosperity deal. That's a partnership across AI, quantum computing and nuclear power. And one example of that partnership - U.S.-based Nvidia, is going to build AI infrastructure in the U.K.MARTÍNEZ: OK, so what else are they going to talk about?KURTZLEBEN: Well, foreign policy, for sure. Remember that Starmer is part of that group of European leaders who want Trump to give greater support to Ukraine in its war against Russia. Well, there hasn't been movement on a peace deal. Russia has continued to just bombard Ukraine. So Starmer may try to push Trump to do more, but Trump is suggesting that it's up to NATO allies to first stop buying Russian oil.For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy - he told the U.K.'s Sky News this week he really wants Starmer to press Trump on specifics on security guarantees and also for some firmness on new Russia sanctions.MARTÍNEZ: There were pretty big protests in the U.K. when Trump visited in his first term. Are we seeing or expecting that kind of reception again?KURTZLEBEN: Very much. Trump is not popular here, and his tariffs here have only made Brits angrier, as our colleague Lauren Frayer has reported. In fact, the protests have already begun. Earlier this week on the lawn outside of Windsor Castle, protesters unfurled a giant photo of Trump and the late Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and sex offender. Now, all of that said, it's a gray and drizzly morning here so far, so that may bring down both Trump's day and the protesters.MARTÍNEZ: All right, that's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks a lot.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.
