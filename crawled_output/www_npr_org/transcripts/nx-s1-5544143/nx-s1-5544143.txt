SCOTT DETROW, HOST:
Susan Monarez went through the long, difficult Senate confirmation process this summer to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She was sworn in at the end of July, only to be fired 29 days later by her boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his boss, President Trump. Since then, there has been a lot of speculation about what happened. A hearing in the Senate today tried to get some answers. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin was there, and now she's here. Hey, Selena.SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.DETROW: So this is the first time Monarez has answered questions in public about what happened. What did she say? What did we learn?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, so a lot of the hearing was about getting details on the dramatic events of August 25, when Monarez met several times with Secretary Kennedy. And that all culminated in her being fired. Kennedy told his version of events in a Senate hearing two weeks ago.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT F KENNEDY JR: I told her that she had to resign because I asked her - are you a trustworthy person? - and she said no.DETROW: I'm going to assume Monarez had a different perspective on what happened.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah. So she says in meetings with Kennedy on that day, he was really upset. She called him animated. She said at times it was hard to follow his logic and that he was railing about CDC's staff.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUSAN MONAREZ: He called CDC the most corrupt federal agency in the world. He said that CDC employees were killing children, and they don't care. He said that CDC employees were bought by the pharmaceutical industry.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: None of which is true, she said. She also said Kennedy told her that the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing and that she had to get on board or be fired, essentially. So she reached out to this Senate committee expressing concerns about what she was being asked to do, and Kennedy found out.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MONAREZ: He told me he could not trust me. And I told him if he could not trust me, he could fire me.DETROW: Did the Department of Health and Human Services respond to that?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon sent me a statement. He denied that changes to the childhood vaccine schedule are already decided. He said, quote, "Susan Monarez was tasked with restoring the CDC to its core mission after decades of bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep eroded its purpose and squandered public trust, and she refused to do it." I should say, several Republican senators in the hearing were sympathetic to Monarez and concerned about what she described. You know, but others questioned her motives and character and noted she'd hired attorneys, who were with her in the hearing. And those moments were tense in the room.DETROW: We should say, she wasn't the only witness. Her firing was not the only topic at the hearing. What else came up today?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, the other witness was Dr. Deb Houry. She was CDC's chief medical officer and resigned in protest when Monarez was fired. And in her opening statement, she said she was blindsided several times by changes that Kennedy made to policy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DEB HOURY: I first learned that the secretary had changed our CDC COVID vaccine guidance on an X social media post.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She also said CDC staff with expertise in measles requested to brief Kennedy during the outbreak in Texas and were not allowed to do that, and that she had to send a memo correcting misinformation that Kennedy said on TV about the measles vaccine. Basically, she described Secretary Kennedy as really sidelining career scientists. She said she served under four presidential administrations, and it has never been anything like this.DETROW: We should say, a big week for CDC news. What else are you watching?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah, so tomorrow begins a two-day vaccine advisory panel meeting. Those are the folks that Kennedy fired and replaced with his allies. And that is something NPR is going to be covering closely for the rest of the week.DETROW: That is NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Thank you so much.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: You're welcome.
