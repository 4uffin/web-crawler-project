STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Some American officials warn that foreign governments are trying to make online conversations about Charlie Kirk's assassination even more divisive. One of the officials giving that warning is Utah Governor Spencer Cox.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SPENCER COX: We have bots from Russia, China, all over the world that are trying to instill disinformation and encourage violence.INSKEEP: That is true. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel looks at whether foreign influence is breaking through in the United States.GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Foreign governments pay some influencers to spread propaganda.DARREN LINVILL: And those influencers are absolutely talking about the Kirk assassination.BRUMFIEL: Darren Linvill is co-director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson University. After Kirk was shot last week, Linvill went online to see what Russian-paid influencers were saying - people like Chay Bowes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHAY BOWES: Just want to say a few words about this tragic murder, assassination of Charlie Kirk.LINVILL: He's Irish, but he lives, I believe, in Moscow or St. Petersburg now. He's in the employ of the Russian government. He works for RT.BRUMFIEL: RT being Russia Today, a state-run news organization. Bowes' six-minute video got around 50,000 views. That's not huge. Linvill says at least one network of automated bots operated by Russia also couldn't get noticed online, and he's not surprised.LINVILL: When a single conversation takes up all the oxygen in the room and everyone on social media is talking about it, the foreign influence can't really break through.BRUMFIEL: Which isn't to say that adversaries of the U.S. aren't discussing the Kirk assassination. McKenzie Sadeghi is an editor at NewsGuard, a media misinformation watchdog. She says state-controlled media in Russia, China and Iran have all mentioned Kirk's death thousands of times. Each government gives the story its own spin.MCKENZIE SADEGHI: In Russian state media, a lot of the coverage we've seen is blaming Ukraine for the assassination and claiming that Ukraine was responsible.BRUMFIEL: Iran is pointing the finger at its enemy, Israel. And Chinese state media is using the Kirk story...SADEGHI: To sort of mock the U.S. as being unstable and out of control and divided.BRUMFIEL: But Sadeghi says these messages are designed for audiences at home, not for Americans, and it's unlikely they're reaching many people in the U.S. Darren Linvill says he wishes he could blame another country for the vitriol he's seeing online, but...LINVILL: It's just us. The call is coming from inside the house.BRUMFIEL: Americans, he says, don't need any help from the outside to get really angry with each other.Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF LUNGFISH'S "BLACK HELICOPTERS")
