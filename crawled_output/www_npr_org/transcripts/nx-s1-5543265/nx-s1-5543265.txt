A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:
For more on how civilians in Gaza City are surviving the latest Israeli offensive, we turn now to Shaina Low. She's a communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a humanitarian organization that helps people displaced by war. She joins us from Amman, Jordan. Shaina, you've been in touch with colleagues in Gaza City. What are they telling you about what's happening there in the last 24 hours?SHAINA LOW: I was in touch with a number of colleagues yesterday evening who told me stories of horror and just facing tremendous fear - days of bombardments of towers being bombed around them, dust and smoke filling the air, bullets hitting the sides of the buildings that they're trying to shelter in. Right now, people in Gaza City are facing an impossible choice - live under bombardment and famine or risk the dangerous journey to the south where they know that there are no services that can accommodate them, that there's no aid to be distributed to help them in their displacement. What we are witnessing is mass forcible transfer of Palestinians from Gaza City, which is a war crime and must be stopped.MARTÍNEZ: You mentioned a very difficult choice that residents there are faced with. Are you hearing that they're making that choice and attempting to head in that direction or just staying in place?LOW: Yes. So two weeks ago, I spoke to my colleague Mohammed (ph) who told me that he and his family were committed to stay in Gaza City, that they had a roof over their head and concrete walls surrounding them and that they would stay until they had no other choice. Right now, he is on his way to the south of Gaza because he told me he could not bear to see the look of fear in his children's eyes any longer. The decision is one that our staff have to make on their own. We have other staff who have told me that the conditions in the south are not even suitable for animals and that they prefer to stay in their homes. And if they die, at least they die in dignity. These are the questions - impossible questions - that our staff and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza City are facing right now.MARTÍNEZ: For the people that are deciding to stay, or for whatever reason can't leave, what do they have around them? Do they have anything basic even - water or anything like that?LOW: Most humanitarian agencies have had - including the Norwegian Refugee Council, have had to at least pause or suspend our operations because the conditions are so unsafe. So we've had to suspend our own water-trucking. There are a handful of organizations that are still providing some type of assistance. But as the bombardment increases and the ground troops advance on the city, it becomes more and more dangerous for humanitarians who are determined to provide support wherever people are in need to continue to fulfill that mission.MARTÍNEZ: You mentioned that water - you've suspended the water-trucking. Any other kinds of supplies getting through? Anything at all?LOW: Very little aid, if anything, is reaching Gaza City at this point. People are describing empty markets or markets where items are just cost prohibitive and far too expensive. We desperately need the world to act to put an end to this. Just yesterday, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry released a report determining that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. This must compel states under the Genocide Convention to do everything in their power to prevent, stop and punish these acts.MARTÍNEZ: And we should note - Israel has repeatedly rejected any reports of genocide in Gaza. But, Shaina, considering everything you just mentioned, how will all of this maybe change your operation with - especially with this new invasion?LOW: Well, we are continuing to see how we can continue to deliver. Our staff that remain there want to deliver as long as they can do so safely and not put themselves and the people who we are trying to help at further risk. But we, of course, will continue to provide services throughout Gaza wherever we have access and wherever we have supplies. Of course, we have not gotten a single item of aid in since Israel imposed a near-total siege over six months ago. And so we are doing the best we can with zero resources coming in.MARTÍNEZ: And real quick, has the Norwegian Refugee Council at all considered just pulling out completely?LOW: We have a commitment to stay and support people as long as we can. Most of our staff are staff from Gaza who are serving the communities and serving the people who are in exactly the same situations as them. So long as we can continue to help people, we will continue to be there.MARTÍNEZ: That's Shaina Low. She's a communications adviser at Norwegian Refugee Council. Thank you very much.LOW: Thank you.
