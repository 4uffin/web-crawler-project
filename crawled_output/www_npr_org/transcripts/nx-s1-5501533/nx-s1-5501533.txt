ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
It's time now for the Health Care Helpline. It's a new series we're launching today in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation and KFF Health News. Here's how it works. You send us your questions about navigating the health care system, and we send out our policy sleuths to investigate and report back. Today, we're hearing from Anna Deutscher. She's 29 years old and lives in Minnesota.ANNA DEUTSCHER: I reached out to you because I wanted to know why my son's hearing tests weren't covered by our insurance and why we needed to pay for it.SHAPIRO: Jackie Fortier is on the case. She's with our partner KFF Health News. Jackie, you spoke to Anna. What's going on with her son's hearing?JACKIE FORTIER: Hey, Ari. So Anna's baby son Beckham was born with CMV.SHAPIRO: I haven't heard of that before. What is it?FORTIER: I hadn't heard of it either. It's a super-common virus. Most of the time it's no big deal. Lots of kids get it as a toddler, but it is concerning if it happens in utero while the brain is forming. That's what happened to Beckham. The doctor told Anna not to Google it.DEUTSCHER: I absolutely Googled it right away because that's just the kind of person I am. I'm not about to not Google it.FORTIER: She found out baby Beckham has a 1 in 5 chance of long-term health problems, especially hearing loss. And if babies can't hear, it can make it difficult to learn to talk. So doctors say his hearing really needs to be tested every few months.SHAPIRO: But she said her insurance isn't going to pay for those tests, even if they're essential. What kind of cost are we talking about here?FORTIER: Yeah. He's had two tests. They were about $340 a pop. He needs 19 more in the next few years. I asked her if she's done the math.DEUTSCHER: I have done the math (laughter).FORTIER: Anna's fighting this because she knows, as Beckham gets older, the family will be on the hook for $6,500 just for his hearing tests. And that's if nothing goes wrong. Beckham's other health care bills are already hard to keep up with. The family's maxed out two credit cards.DEUTSCHER: Every cent of a bonus or Christmas money or tax returns, everything just immediately goes right to trying to pay that debt off.SHAPIRO: Spending Christmas money on hearing tests sounds awful. Why isn't the insurance covering this?FORTIER: Well, the plan says in black and white that it does not cover hearing tests, but that seems kind of weird to me. So I called an insurance expert, JoAnn Volk. She's a professor at Georgetown University. And she actually showed me a list of preventative services for kids that are supposed to be covered by law. Hearing tests are on that list.JOANN VOLK: But it really does come down to everyone sort of being on their best behavior on the provider and plan's side to truly interpret and follow, you know, what should be covered.SHAPIRO: So the law says hearing tests must be covered. The insurance plan says hearing tests won't be covered. What has to happen to get everybody on the same page?FORTIER: Well, that all comes down to something called medical coding. It's the shorthand that hospitals use to tell an insurance company exactly what the doctor is billing for. Three digits can be the difference between getting care covered or owing thousands of dollars.SHAPIRO: What did you see when you looked at those bills with the medical coding?FORTIER: Well, I had no idea, so I sent the paperwork to someone who did. Rhonda Buckholtz is a billing expert. She took a look and said one code was missing on some of the bills.RHONDA BUCKHOLTZ: They've got to make sure they use one for the baby's condition so that they understand that it was medically necessary.FORTIER: Rhonda thinks the bill is getting flagged for a denial because it didn't say anything about the reason for the hearing tests. The CMV code is missing.SHAPIRO: So if the doctor puts in the CMV code, is the family no longer going to have to pay out of pocket?FORTIER: Well, not according to the doctor's office. They said that they didn't mess up anything in the coding. So instead, Anna explored other ways to get her money back. She went through every appeal the insurance company allowed and was denied every time.DEUTSCHER: I was expecting it, but I was still very frustrated with it.SHAPIRO: Is that just another dead end? Is Anna out of options now?FORTIER: Not quite. Our billing expert, Rhonda, had one more idea.BUCKHOLTZ: They could go and talk to their employer, and the employer could advocate to get those services covered.FORTIER: She recommends asking your company's human resources department for help. HR has contacts that you don't. And in Anna's case, it worked. Her employer covered the cost of the hearing tests for this year.SHAPIRO: For this year. Well, what did Anna say about that?DEUTSCHER: It's just been like this constant kind of cloud hanging over my head. So for that to suddenly just, like, be lifted, it didn't feel real. It didn't feel real at the time.FORTIER: Anna's employer also added hearing tests to the 2026 policy. So now all of Beckham's future hearing tests will be paid for by insurance. So the takeaway is, if you think something is preventive and should be paid for, keep pushing and, you know, maybe call HR.SHAPIRO: Thanks for the detective work. That is Jackie Fortier of KFF Health News.FORTIER: Thank you, Ari.SHAPIRO: And Health Care Helpline wants to hear from you. Go to npr.org and send us your questions or frustrations about navigating the health care system.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
