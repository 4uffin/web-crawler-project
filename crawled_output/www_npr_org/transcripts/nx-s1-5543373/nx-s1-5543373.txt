ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Puerto Rican megastar Bad Bunny has announced he's not playing any concerts in the 50 states during his current world tour because he's afraid that ICE, as he said, could be outside my concert. As a Puerto Rican, of course, he is an American citizen. Performers from other countries who want to tour the U.S. are facing additional issues. NPR culture correspondent Anastasia Tsioulcas is following this. Hi, Anastasia.ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS, BYLINE: Hi there, Ari.SHAPIRO: You've been talking with performers, event presenters, people in the industry. What are they telling you?TSIOULCAS: Yeah, so touring artists, musicians, theater performers, dancers, those kinds of entertainers are dealing with a lot of uncertainty right now. And I'll say that people in that realm have been very hesitant to speak to me on the record for this story. They are fearful of being targeted in some way, either by the folks who hold decision-making power over visa approvals or hold financial sway, including state-level, local-level government funding and private funding.SHAPIRO: As we mentioned, Bad Bunny publicly expressed concerns that his Latino fans would be targeted by federal immigration officers. Are you hearing that from other artists?TSIOULCAS: Well, first of all, I should say, in a written statement to NPR today, the assistant secretary of DHS, Tricia McLaughlin, said to me, quote, "Bad Bunny is either seriously misinformed about ICE operations or is using law enforcement as an excuse because he won't be able to sell tickets in the United States. ICE is not raiding concert venues.".Now, still, I'm hearing speculation about this from other folks in entertainment and the arts. So, for example, in July, community leaders and local officials in Chicago accused federal agents of targeting attendees at the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture, and they shared video of ICE agents at their museum. Homeland Security denied those accusations at the time. Regardless, folks working in culture and entertainment are worried about similar situations potentially happening at their events.SHAPIRO: Bad Bunny is pretty huge. Seems safe to say he would be able to sell tickets in the United States. But for musicians who are maybe not quite - in the mainland of the United States, that is. For other musicians, what else has changed?TSIOULCAS: Well, there are new hurdles for foreign artists. People coming to the U.S. as entertainers need a specific kind of visa. And just earlier this month, the State Department announced that people applying for those and other kinds of visas have to return to their home country, their country of nationality, or where they live full-time to apply for visas to visit the U.S. And that is creating big, expensive complications for performers who earn their money touring the world.SHAPIRO: Can you give us an example?TSIOULCAS: Sure. I will give you an example based on some real cases I'm hearing about. Say there is an artist, for example, from India who wants to apply to come to do a tour in the United States, but they're temporarily working in, let's say, Belgium. So it used to be they could go to the U.S. consulate in Belgium for that U.S. visa interview. And the State Department's now saying, no, each person applying has to fly home to India to apply and be interviewed there.So that's creating big personal expenses and big time commitments, especially for touring groups with big vans and crews. And as it is, Ari, visa applications can cost in the neighborhood of $8,000 or upwards, including legal fees. And State says they're, quote, "upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process."SHAPIRO: How long is that likely to take?TSIOULCAS: Right now, they're saying it can take up to seven months to do that. That's State's estimate. Lawyers are telling me it could take much longer than that.SHAPIRO: NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas, thank you.TSIOULCAS: You bet.(SOUNDBITE OF LUPE FIASCO SONG, "OUTSIDE")
