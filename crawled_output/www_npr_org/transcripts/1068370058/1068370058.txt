AILSA CHANG, HOST:
One of the great movie stars of his era has died. Robert Redford died early this morning at his home in Utah, according to his representative, Cindi Berger. He was 89 years old. Redford starred in more than 80 movies, many of them classics. NPR's Neda Ulaby has this remembrance.NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: One word comes up with Robert Redford over and over and over. That word is golden.(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "THE GREAT GATSBY")ROBERT REDFORD: (As Jay Gatsby) How do you do, old sport? I'm Gatsby.ULABY: He gleaned in "The Great Gatsby" and radiated as an investigative reporter in "All The President's Men."(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN")REDFORD: (As Bob Woodward) If you're going to do it, do it right. Here's my notes. If you're going to hype it, hype it with the facts. I don't mind what you did. I mind the way you did it.ULABY: And he brought glamour to outdoorsy films like "The Horse Whisperer."(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "THE HORSE WHISPERER")REDFORD: (As Tom Booker) When I work with a horse, I like to know its history.ULABY: Robert Redford's history started, fittingly, in Los Angeles. His working-class family were the only Anglos on a mostly Mexican block. As a kid, Redford often misbehaved in school, as he told NPR in 2003.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)REDFORD: I was constantly up at the blackboard, either being punished for things I'd done wrong and having to do repetitions of math on the board, or I was drawing telling a story.ULABY: Redford wanted to be an artist. In his late teens, he worked on an oil rig to afford a year to study painting in Europe. But when he came back to the U.S. for college, says film critic Carrie Rickey, it was Redford's beauty that took up all the air in the room.CARRIE RICKEY: They said when he walked into the cafeteria, you could drop a pin because everyone was looking at him. I think he was profoundly ambivalent about his looks and wanted to communicate that.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REDFORD: (As Paul Bratter) I've been walking barefoot in the park.ULABY: Redford's breakthrough was on Broadway in Neil Simon's play "Barefoot In The Park." The movie version came out in 1967 with Jane Fonda.(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "BAREFOOT IN THE PARK")JANE FONDA: (As Corie Bratter) You're drunk.REDFORD: (As Paul Bratter, laughter) You finally noticed.ULABY: You know who else noticed Robert Redford? Paul Newman.(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID")REDFORD: (As The Sundance Kid) Ready?PAUL NEWMAN: (As Butch Cassidy) No, we'll jump.ULABY: He helped Redford get cast as his costar in 1969's "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid." With its famous cliff-jumping scene, the movie made Redford a generational icon.(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID")REDFORD: (As The Sundance Kid) Come on. Just one clear shot. That's all I want.NEWMAN: (As Butch Cassidy) Come on.REDFORD: (As The Sundance Kid) Uh-uh.NEWMAN: (As Butch Cassidy) We got to.REDFORD: (As The Sundance Kid) Get away from me.NEWMAN: (As Butch Cassidy) Why?REDFORD: (As The Sundance Kid) I want to fight 'em.ULABY: The most successful film of the year led to other hits - "The Sting," "Jeremiah Johnson," "The Way We Were." When Robert Redford made his first film as a director in 1980, "Ordinary People" beat Martin Scorsese and "Raging Bull" for best director and best picture at the Oscars.(SOUNDBITE 53RD ACADEMY AWARDS BROADCAST)REDFORD: Well, I just didn't think I was going to see this.ULABY: Redford went on to star in some of the era's luscious period blockbusters, such as "The Natural" and "Out Of Africa," 1 of 7 films he made with Meryl Streep. What could be more dreamy than Robert Redford quoting poetry while washing Streep's hair?(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "OUT OF AFRICA")REDFORD: (As Denys) He prayeth well who loveth well, both man and bird and beast.ULABY: But Redford never won a single Oscar for acting.RICKEY: He tended to be a minimalist on screen, often interrupting himself to make it sound like actual speech.ULABY: Critic Carrie Rickey says Redford kept starring in movies, including much later as a Marvel movie villain. But the actor found freedom off screen. He transformed the industry itself by founding the Sundance Institute in 1981.RICKEY: Sundance was the way he supported film artists to do what they loved.ULABY: The film artists who broke through at Sundance are too many to name, but they include the directors Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh and Robert Rodriguez with his 1992 film "El Mariachi."(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "EL MARIACHI")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character, speaking Spanish).ULABY: Over the years, Sundance evolved into an independent powerhouse with prestigious programs for theater, music, Native American film and documentaries that helped produce numerous Oscar winners, such as "Crip Camp."(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, "CRIP CAMP")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: There is no (inaudible).RICKEY: I mean, he changed so many lives, and he changed movies both as a director and as the head of Sundance. I mean, God, who else can say that?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)REDFORD: All the films that I've made are about the country I live in and grew up in.ULABY: Robert Redford told NPR in 2013 he was not interested in America as Black and white or blue and red.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)REDFORD: I was interested in the gray part where complexity lies.ULABY: Redford believed that complexity was the enemy of celebrity. And as a celebrity himself, he believed stardom contributed to cultural simplification.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)REDFORD: It's got a dangerous side to it. I think that the people should be paying a lot more attention to other issues rather than who's the Top 10 this or who's the Top 5 or who's the sexiest or the most beautiful or this or that.ULABY: The things Robert Redford cared about included the environment and Indigenous rights. A passionate and private man, he was ultimately what he always strove to be - an artist.Neda Ulaby, NPR News.
