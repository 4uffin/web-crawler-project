SCOTT DETROW, HOST:
The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates today for the first time in nine months. The central bank is hoping to keep a lid on unemployment. Meanwhile, President Trump has been waging a high-pressure campaign to get the Fed to slash rates more aggressively. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now. Hi, Scott.SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi. Good to be with you.DETROW: The central bank cut rates by a quarter percentage point. What are Fed officials thinking?HORSLEY: They are worried about the softening job market. You know, employers added only 22,000 jobs in August. Revised figures show the economy actually lost jobs in June for the first time since the pandemic winter of 2020. Unemployment's still pretty low, just 4.3%, but that's largely because there's been very little growth in the number of available workers. So Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has described the job market as being in a curious balance, but one that could easily become unbalanced in a way that's not good for workers.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: You've got a low-firing, low-hiring environment, and the concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off won't - there won't be a lot of hiring going on. So that could very quickly flow into higher unemployment.HORSLEY: So the Fed is hoping to forestall that by cutting interest rates, which will make it cheaper to borrow money. On average, members of the Fed's rate-setting committee signaled they expect to cut rates by another half percentage point by the end of this year.DETROW: A theme of your reporting, Scott, had been that the Fed was cautious about cutting interest rates because they were worried about rising prices. Does this move mean they're no longer worried about inflation?HORSLEY: No. Those inflation worries have not gone away. You know, consumer prices in August were up 2.9% from a year ago, which was the biggest annual increase in seven months. And inflation's been moving in the wrong direction lately, partly as a result of President Trump's tariffs. We've seen higher prices for goods across the board, especially imported goods like clothing and small electronics. Powell says most of the cost so far is being borne by U.S. importers, and while that cost has not entirely shown up in consumer prices, he thinks it probably will.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: All of those companies, they'll tell you that they have every intention of passing that through in time, but they're not doing that now. To the consumer, the pass through has been slower and smaller than we thought. But the evidence is - it's very clear that there's some pass through.HORSLEY: Now, Fed officials are betting the tariffs will have a one-time effect on prices and probably won't continue to cause higher inflation month after month. But Powell says that's not guaranteed. So it's something he and his colleagues are keeping a close eye on.DETROW: President Trump has been putting unprecedented pressure on the Fed, demanding for months that they make deeper cuts, and the president has a new ally at the central bank. Tell us about that.HORSLEY: Yeah, Trump appointed White House economist Stephen Miran to an open seat on the Fed board. Miran was narrowly confirmed by the Senate on Monday, and he cast his first vote on interest rates today. He was the only member of the rate-setting committee to break with his colleagues and push for a bigger half percentage point rate cut. But Powell says there was no serious consideration of that, so markets shouldn't dwell on Miran's lone dissenting vote.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: The only way for any voter to really move things around is to be incredibly persuasive, and the only way to do that in the context in which we work is to make really strong arguments based on the data and one's understanding of the economy. That's really all that matters.HORSLEY: Significantly, two Fed board members, who were appointed by Trump in his first term, did not join Miran today in voting for that bigger rate cut. So for the time being, he's kind of a lonely voice at the central bank, but Trump is hoping to add more voices to that chorus. He has tried to oust Fed governor Lisa Cook over unproven claims she made false statements on a mortgage application. That's being fought out in court. If Trump is ultimately successful in exerting more control over the central bank, that would be a real break with decades of tradition in which the Fed operates independently of the White House. And critics say when central banks are under the thumb of politicians, they tend to do a worse job of controlling inflation.DETROW: NPR's Scott Horsley. Thanks so much.HORSLEY: You're welcome.
