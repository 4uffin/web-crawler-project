SCOTT DETROW, HOST:
President Trump campaigned on a promise to bring change to Washington, and eight months in, it is clear he's going for monumental change. Beyond draining the swamp, he is upending entire systems and knocking down checks on presidential power. NPR's Andrea Hsu and Carrie Johnson report.CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: To understand the lengths President Trump is going to to disrupt the status quo, consider that his administration's already facing more than 300 lawsuits over actions he's taken to bring change.ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: And many of these cases boil down to, can he do that? Do presidents really have that power? One of them was brought by Cathy Harris.CATHY HARRIS: I was the chairman and then member of the Merit Systems Protection Board until President Trump terminated me.HSU: The Merit Systems Protection Board, that's an agency established by Congress almost 50 years ago. It's staffed by judges who hear federal employees' appeals of personnel actions. The agency's mission is to ensure federal workers are protected against abuses by management.HARRIS: We are one of a few agencies that I call the good government agencies.JOHNSON: Congress dictated the Merit Systems Protection Board have members from both political parties nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Congress also held members can only be terminated for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance. Cathy Harris says no such cause was provided in the termination letter she got.HARRIS: You know, it was like two lines. Thank you for your service. You know, you're fired, basically.HSU: It fell off to her, very off.HARRIS: It was so obviously against the law.HSU: Cathy Harris sued the Trump administration to get her job back. Lower courts initially ordered her reinstated. But the Trump administration appealed, and the Supreme Court said the administration could fire Harris for now. The conservative majority wrote that because Article II of the Constitution vests the executive power in the president, he may remove officers who exercise power on his behalf, with some narrow exceptions.JOHNSON: We called on James Burnham to help explain. Burnham worked at the Justice Department during Trump's first term and served as general counsel at the Department of Government Efficiency this year.JAMES BURNHAM: There's a - I think, a quite a strong Article II argument that the president has the authority to remove anybody who wields basically any modicum of authority.HSU: After all, voters put the president in charge of the executive branch, and he needs to be able to supervise it. Cathy Harris rejects this argument.HARRIS: Our country is built on a separation of powers, a balance of powers. And when you give the president unfettered power, you're taking away the power from Congress. Congress put me in this job.HSU: And Congress dictated that she cannot be removed without cause, which Harris says makes sense.HARRIS: You know, the president can pick his lawyers, but he can't pick who's going to judge cases.JOHNSON: I asked James Burnham, under the logic that the Trump administration's pushing in court, who wouldn't the president be able to fire?BURNHAM: One example would be very low-level people - the receptionist in the U.S. attorney's office.JOHNSON: In other words, Burnham says, only people who don't exercise federal power over regulating the public in any meaningful way.HSU: Burnham acknowledges the arguments the administration is putting forward are a departure from the past.BURNHAM: I don't know that you've had past presidents that were as willing to sort of assert their authority in this way.HSU: Not even Trump in his first term, but Burnham says something changed in the four years since Trump first left the White House.BURNHAM: The fact that the Biden administration tried to put President Trump in prison.JOHNSON: Federal prosecutors brought two separate criminal cases against Trump for mishandling classified documents in Florida and trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Washington, D.C. Both those cases have been dropped, but President Trump has not forgotten them.HSU: This year, the Justice Department moved to fire the people who prosecuted Trump. Trump also fired watchdogs, known as inspectors general, and heads of agencies like the Merit Systems Protection Board set up by Congress to have some degree of independence from the White House. We asked Burnham if Trump is allowed to fire heads of independent agencies, should we not be calling them independent anymore?BURNHAM: I mean, I don't think they've ever been independent because I think the removal protections have been unconstitutional from the beginning.JOHNSON: This question - whether or not Trump can remove all these people - is likely going to get a full hearing before the Supreme Court in the coming months. The decisions the court issued so far are emergency stays meant to be temporary. But even if the Supreme Court goes another way once it hears arguments in the cases, it's hard to see how you put things back together now that so many people have been removed. Again, James Burnham.BURNHAM: I mean, I think the president would say that that's a virtue. But I also think that the administration is extremely likely to prevail at the Supreme Court on all the issues where they've issued stays so far.HSU: Already, even without the Supreme Court, one watchdog agency has been transformed. The Office of Special Counsel is an independent agency that investigates complaints about wrongdoing in the government.JOHNSON: At least it was.Is your former office still independent?HAMPTON DELLINGER: It is not - not even close.JOHNSON: That's Hampton Dellinger, who was appointed special counsel by former President Biden in 2024. Dellinger was supposed to serve a five-year term, but Trump fired him too.HSU: Dellinger sued to get his job back and was briefly reinstated. Eventually, an appeals court decided his firing could go ahead, citing a Supreme Court decision that found the president did have power over agencies like his - those led by one person, not a bipartisan board. Rather than fight on from the sidelines, Dellinger ended his legal battle.DELLINGER: There was no way I could guarantee that whistleblowers would be protected if there wasn't an independent agency head running the office.JOHNSON: Now there's a temporary head of the office, the U.S. trade representative.DELLINGER: That person now is at the beck and call of the president of the United States. That has never been the case before.JOHNSON: This month, a group of fired federal workers sued the new acting special counsel, arguing he failed to protect thousands of people illegally laid off from their jobs. They say the special counsel is now an arm of the White House.HSU: Hampton Dellinger did not want to address the new lawsuit, but he says think about a federal employee going up against the Trump administration right now. How would they feel about blowing the whistle when they've seen people get fired for doing their jobs?DELLINGER: It used to be in the past that if you were a federal employee and you broke the law, you would get fired. And now we see federal employees getting fired for following the law. That's a complete sea change.HSU: Dellinger says it was never easy to be a whistleblower, but now he says it's harder than ever. In recent months, new leaders at the office have dropped some of the cases Dellinger brought, and whistleblower protection groups say they worry their clients will not get a fair hearing.JOHNSON: Over a century ago, the federal government pivoted from a spoil system - it's not what you know, but who you know - into one that rewards merit, knowledge and experience.HSU: The idea is firefighters who battle wildfires out west or air traffic controllers who survey the skies should not be hired based on their political party.JOHNSON: The Trump administration, on a scale not seen in many generations, now wants to consolidate his power over the executive and hire and fire as he sees fit. Carrie Johnson.HSU: Andrea Hsu, NPR News, Washington.(SOUNDBITE OF FREDDIE GIBBS & MADLIB SONG, "GAT D***")
