ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Time now for "My Unsung Hero," our series from the team at the Hidden Brain podcast. "My Unsung Hero" tells the stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else. Today's story comes from Juli Cobb of Albuquerque, New Mexico. One afternoon, Cobb was driving home from work when she ran out of gas. Her car sputtered to a stop in the middle of the road near a crowded homeless encampment under the freeway.JULI COBB: I was sitting there so vulnerable, and I was anxious. But this man ran by, ran up to me from under the bridge and asked me if I needed help. And I said, I think I've run out of gas. And he said, well, first, we need to get you out of the road. And so he single-handedly tried to push me. And I couldn't unlock the steering, and it wasn't moving. And so then two other men ran over to help. And again, can we help you? And what's going on? And so the three of them were able to get me off the side of the road. And as they were trying to do that, they had to maneuver a big semi around me, which they did.And the first man said, I can get you some gas. I have a gas can. And he ran off and he got his bicycle. And one of the men that had run up introduced himself as Dominic (ph), and he said, this is a dangerous place. You know, there are some people that would take advantage of this situation. Have you called anybody? And I said, I'm calling my daughter right now. And he said, I will stay here with you until she gets here. And then the first man came back with his bike and his gas can and put gas in my car. And as that was happening, traffic is going by, and I had this striking realization that these men - who didn't ask for anything and really are on the street and trying to survive, don't know where their next meal is coming from, probably - just ran over to help. So that was pretty impactful on me.SHAPIRO: Juli Cobb lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
