SCOTT DETROW, HOST:
Every year, more than 5 million skin cancers are detected in the U.S. New research published today in JAMA Dermatology from the American Medical Association shows vitamin B3 supplements can be helpful. As NPR's Allison Aubrey reports, police who took the supplement had a much lower chance of cancer recurrence.ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Doctors who perform skin cancer surgeries often recommend nicotinamide, which is a form of vitamin B3. Small studies have shown it can help prevent basal and squamous cell skin cancers. Now, a large study offers new evidence from more than 33,000 veterans treated at VA facilities. Here's study author Dr. Lee Wheless of Vanderbilt University.LEE WHELESS: What we found was that there was a 53% reduction in the risk of skin cancers among patients taking nicotinamide.AUBREY: B3 supplements are widely available over the counter. The participants took 500 milligrams twice daily for at least 30 days. Dr. Sarah Arron is a dermatologist in the San Francisco Bay area who performs Mohs surgery on people with skin cancers. She was not involved in the study. She says she's been on the fence about when to recommend B3 supplements to her patients, but this new study provides stronger evidence.SARAH ARRON: Now that I see this paper coming out, I am going to be more rigorous in recommending it to patients, especially patients who are having their first skin cancer. I think the benefit is strongest at that point if we start it early.AUBREY: All of the patients in the study had been diagnosed with a prior skin cancer, so it's not possible to say whether vitamin B3 would be beneficial for people who have never had skin cancer. Doctor Arron says more research is needed.ARRON: It is certainly possible that somebody who is at high risk for skin cancer, who's already showing signs of precancerous change in the skin, might benefit from nicotinamide, but we'll have to do those studies to see whether it can be used for primary prevention.AUBREY: She says B3 can help protect against DNA damage.ARRON: When sunlight hits the skin and causes the DNA damage to lead to cancer, vitamin B3 supports the body in correcting that before it causes a bigger problem.AUBREY: Lots of skin care products and creams include forms of vitamin B3, but Arron says it's unclear if they have any influence on cancer prevention. She says the number one strategy to protect skin is advice you have most likely already heard - lather up with sunscreen and cover up.Allison Aubrey, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF SHYGIRL SONG, "HEAVEN")
