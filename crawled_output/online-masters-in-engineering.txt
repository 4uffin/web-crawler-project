According to the BLS, engineers earned a median annual wage of $100,000, well above the median for all occupations, which was $49,500 in 2024.Engineering salaries vary by specialization. For example, in 2024, agricultural engineers earned a median annual salary of $84,630, while computer hardware engineers earned $155,020. Factors like industry, experience level, and location may also influence pay.Advanced education can be a competitive advantage. The Bureau reported that in 2022, 42% of engineers held a master's or doctoral degree. A graduate degree may help you access higher-paying, leadership, or specialized roles within the field.Career outlook with an online engineering master's degreeThe BLS projects a growth of about 195,000 jobs per year in the engineering and architecture fields from 2023-33.Specifically, the BLS projects significant growth over the next decade in software development (+17%), industrial engineering (+12%), mechanical engineering (+11%), and electrical engineering (+9%). These percentages are much higher than the projected average growth rate of +4% across all occupations.$100,000Median annual wage for engineers195,000 jobsProjected annual growth rateAdmission requirements for an online master's in engineeringWhile each online master's program has different admissions standards, common eligibility requirements include:Bachelor's degree in engineering or a related field from an accredited institutionA minimum GPAOfficial transcriptsLetters of recommendationPersonal statementApplication feeRésumé or CVNote that many online master's in engineering programs don't require GRE scores. Some programs may require English proficiency tests for international students.Accreditation and professional licensureThe Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is a U.S.-based accreditor that certifies engineering programs.
