But when you start playing under tournament conditions you start seeing a little of those nuances."US Open champion JJ Spaun and Russell Henley are best placed of the remaining eight Ryder Cup players on nine under.Griffin, a captain's pick who will make his debut at the Ryder Cup, said: "I've got to have that chasing mindset as a leader because I know all those guys behind me are going to stay aggressive and I've got to do everything I can to stay in front."Related topicsGolfComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 32Top storiesLive.Â Ricky Hatton's legacy will 'live on' as tributes pour in for champion boxer27894 viewing28k viewingLive.Â Premier League: Salah scores injury-time penalty as Liverpool finally lead at Burnley263707 viewing264k viewingLive.Â Watch: England face Scotland in Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final13474 viewing13k viewingElsewhere on the BBCAcclaimed period mystery with an all-star castHow the 1933 Enabling Act gave Adolf Hitler unchecked powerA challenging story of sexual identity starring Brian CoxSpinal Tap: The legendary comic band reunite after 40 yearsElsewhere in Sport'Crawford conquers Canelo to become the face of boxing'Seville storms to 100m gold as Bolt cheers him on.
