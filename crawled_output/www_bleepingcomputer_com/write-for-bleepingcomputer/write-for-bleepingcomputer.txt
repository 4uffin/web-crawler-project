Write for BleepingComputer
Are you passionate about computers, security, the web, and technology? Are you able to write high quality articles? If so, we would love to consider you as a writer on BleepingComputer.com.
When writing for BleepingComputer, technology, security, and computers are our main focus. As long as the writing is relevant to these subjects, it can be a review, news article, editorial, or an opinion piece. The top priority is that the articles be informative, original, objective, and interesting.
What is required, though, is that anything you write at BleepingComputer.com must be original and not copied from another site. Furthermore, we do not allow articles that are created solely to promote a particular product or service for financial reasons. For that, we have plenty of advertising options.
If you are still interested in writing for BleepingComputer.com, then please read the writer guidelines below.
Writer Guidelines
When writing at BleepingComputer.com, we expect all writers to adhere to the following qualities when writing their articles:
Enjoyable: Let's face it, writing about something you do not enjoy is not enjoyable for the writer and will probably not be that enjoyable for the reader. Therefore, write about what you are interested in. If you are interested in computer security and hate Windows, then do not write about Microsoft. If you like to game, but could care less about security, then don't bother writing about the latest video game. Focus on what interests you.
Original: The articles at BleepingComputer.com should be not only enjoyable to read, but also interesting and original. Make anything you write about your own so that readers leave saying "Wow, that person knows their stuff!".
Informative: Articles should be informative so that visitors leave the site having learned about a new development, service, opportunity, or product. We have visitors with varied levels of experience with technology, so writing should be done in a way that anyone can understand it.
If you agree with the qualities we expect and wish to become a writer on BleepingComputer.com, feel free to contact us. When contacting us, please include information and links to any articles that you have previously written so that we can review your work.
Those we accept as writers will also need to send us a short bio and headshot that will be shown on your author page and at the bottom of your articles.
General Notes
Writers are required to provide full disclosure of any agency, client, or partner relationships. Our editors also reserve the right to remove any self-promotional links or content, as well as make edits to the content of articles and headlines as needed.
If you are accepted to write for BleepingComputer.com, you agree that you will only be submitting original content created by yourself for BleepingComputer.com. Unless given permission, we do not allow articles contributed to BleepingComputer to be posted elsewhere.
