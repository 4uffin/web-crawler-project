You don’t need to stay on top of the latest technology trends or spend thousands of dollars to sport a reliable laptop. Instead, you can save yourself hundreds of dollars by opting for a new-to-you device—like this refurbished Acer 11.6” Chromebook 311. This lightweight laptop is an ideal companion for the busy bee always on the go, or even for your kids, who can get a little clumsy from time to time.
The Acer 11.6” Chromebook is now available for just $99.99 (MSRP: $199.99) for a limited time.
This Chromebook is a practical option for everyday tasks like writing, browsing the web, and answering impromptu meeting calls. It runs on ChromeOS, which means you surf the web on a secure, fast, and easy-to-use browser. Switching between all your favorite Google apps has never been easier.
Its 11.6-inch screen offers HD 1366 x 768 stunning visuals paired with a lightweight design, making it an ideal companion for users looking for a device that can keep up with a busy lifestyle. Whether you’re working from home, on the bus, or at a local café, this Acer Chromebook is designed with speed, portability, and simplicity in mind.
Powered by the Mediatek MT8183 processor with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, this Chromebook delivers smooth performance for cramming in last-minute tasks before your next meeting.
It also offers versatile connectivity with faster wireless speeds, two USB 3.1 Type-C ports for ultra-quick data transfer and battery charging, as well as two USB 3.0 Type-A Ports and a microSD slot for expanding storage capacity.
As a refurbished model, you can get all the perks of a brand-new device at a fraction of the cost. This 2019 model is listed with a Grade A rating, meaning it’ll arrive in near-mint condition with next to no scuffs or dents on the case. Refurbished models go through rigorous and thorough inspection, cleaning, and testing before ever hitting the market. But, for added peace of mind, you can rely on an aftermarket 1-year non-accidental parks and labor warranty.
If you’re in need of a reliable computer you can take anywhere, get an Acer 11.6” Chromebook on sale for $99.99 (MSRP: $199.99) for a limited time
