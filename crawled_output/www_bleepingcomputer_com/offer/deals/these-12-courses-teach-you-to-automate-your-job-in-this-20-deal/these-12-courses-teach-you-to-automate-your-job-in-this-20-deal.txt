Learning new skills has always been a good way to stay ahead, but the pace of change over the past couple of years has been on another level. Artificial intelligence went from being a curiosity to a tool people are using every day, and those who figure it out early are already ahead of the curve.
The ChatGPT and Automation E-Degree is designed to help you catch up, giving you a straightforward way to learn how AI and automation actually work in real-world settings. It’s also on sale for only $19.97 (reg. $790).
Learn to automate your work
This bundle comes with 12 courses that add up to more than 25 hours of content. Once you sign up, the material is yours for life, so you can go at your own pace and revisit lessons whenever you need a refresher.
Course content is practical and direct. You’ll learn how to customize ChatGPT for different industries, set up automation to save time on repetitive tasks, and turn raw data into clear visualizations. Along the way, you’ll also get hands-on experience with more than 20 other AI tools that can make a difference in areas like marketing, coding, and business operations.
These lessons are approachable for beginners, so you don’t need a technical background to get started. The lessons focus on how to use AI in everyday work, whether that means drafting content more quickly, analyzing information, or collaborating more smoothly with a team. At the end, you’ll earn a certificate of completion that can help you showcase your skills to employers or clients.
For a limited time, you can get the ChatGPT and Automation E-Degree on sale for only $20.
