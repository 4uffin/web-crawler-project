Not everyone needs to master Photoshop or pay monthly fees just to make their photos look good. Luminar Neo keeps things simple with AI that handles the heavy lifting, like retouching portraits or replacing parts of your photos. The best part? You can buy it outright with add-ons for $79.99 and never think about subscriptions again (MSRP $682).
What is Luminar Neo?
Luminar Neo is an award-winning photo editor designed to bring Photoshop-type tools to anyone, even if you don’t have experience. At its core are AI-driven tools that turn complex adjustments into one-click fixes.
Want to swap out a flat sky for something dramatic? Skyᴬᴵ handles it instantly. Need to brighten up a poorly lit photo? Relightᴬᴵ makes it look like you shot it in perfect conditions.
Other tools make portrait work easier, like Skinᴬᴵ for natural retouching and Compositionᴬᴵ for automatically improving framing and perspective. For more precision, you still get layers, masks, and local adjustments—all in an interface that’s much easier to navigate than traditional pro editors.
It runs on both Windows and macOS, and even works as a plugin for Photoshop or Lightroom if you want to mix it into an existing workflow.
What’s included?
This deal isn’t just the core editor—it’s packed with extras that expand what you can do. You’ll get access to a 10-part video course from landscape photographer Albert Dros, who walks you through creative editing techniques and shows how to make the most of Luminar Neo’s features.
The bundle also includes a full set of creative add-ons:
Color Harmony LUTs to boost vibrancy in portraits
Frosty Winter LUTs for moody, dramatic seasonal shots
Light Reflections overlays to add bold, modern lighting effects
Wintertime overlays with snow, sparkles, and stars
Tranquil Dawn Skies pack with 25 serene sunsets and sunrises
Tender Blushing Skies pack filled with vivid reds, oranges, and pinks
Save 88% on the bundle
Get the Luminar Neo lifetime bundle here for $79.99 (MSRP $682).
Prices subject to change.
