Usage Instructions
There are currently 4,506 Uninstall Program entries in our database.
This database contains a list of entries that can appear in your Uninstall Programs control panel.
These programs can be unwanted programs, and thus should be uninstalled,
or for legitimate programs that you may want to leave installed. For most applications,
you can remove the software using the Uninstall Programs control panel. Malware related programs,
though, may add these entries to appear legitimate and are not able to be uninstalled using this method.
This database will allow you to determine if an entry in your Uninstall Programs list should be uninstalled.
