Microsoft reminds of Windows 10 support ending in 30 days

On Friday, Microsoft reminded customers once again that Windows 10 will reach its end of support in 30 days, on October 14.
Windows 10 2015 LTSB and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSB 2015 will also reach the end of extended support on the same date.
After it retires Windows 10, Microsoft will stop providing bug fixes or technical assistance for issues affecting security, stability, or usability.
"On October 14, 2025, Windows 10, version 22H2 (Home, Pro, Enterprise, Education, and IoT Enterprise editions) will reach end of servicing," Redmond announced in a message center update.
"The October 2025 monthly security update will be the last update available for these versions. After this date, devices running these versions will no longer receive monthly security and preview updates containing protections from the latest security threats."
Microsoft advises customers who want their Windows 10 devices to keep receiving essential security updates and bug fixes to upgrade eligible systems to Windows 11 or migrate to Windows 11 in the cloud with Windows 365.
Windows 10 users can also delay switching to Windows 11 by enrolling in the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which costs $30 for home users and $61 per device for one year for enterprise customers. This ESU program is also available for free to home users who use Microsoft Rewards points to enroll or are willing to enable Windows Backup to sync their data to the cloud.
Windows 10 Virtual Machines and devices accessing Windows 11 Cloud PCs via Windows 365 can also use ESU at no additional charge, allowing them to receive security updates without extra steps.
The other option is to switch to Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) releases, which are Windows editions specifically designed for specialized devices (such as industrial or medical equipment) to keep receiving updates beyond October 2025.
For instance, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 will reach the Mainstream End Date on January 12, 2027 (with extended support for the IoT Enterprise edition), while Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019 reaches its Extended End Date two years later, on January 9, 2029.
For details on end-of-service dates for Windows releases, use the Lifecycle Policy search tool or visit the Windows Lifecycle FAQ page. Microsoft also has a list of all products retiring or reaching the end of support this year.
According to Statcounter Global Stats, Windows 11 has finally surpassed Windows 10's number of installs, with over 53% of all Windows systems now running Windows 11, compared to 42% on Windows 10. Additionally, as of August 2025, Steam's Hardware & Software Survey indicates that 60.39% of gamers use Windows 11, while 35.08% use Windows 10.

Even if I didn't have an enterprise copy of Win10, I would go LTSC, or failing that server 2025. Before I ever consider upgrading to the sh!tshow that is Win11.
