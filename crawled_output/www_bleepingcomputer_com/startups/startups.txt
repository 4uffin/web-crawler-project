HomeStartup Programs Database
Usage Instructions
There are currently 26,926 startup items in our database.
Startup programs are programs that are automatically started by Windows when the operating system starts.
The problem is that many programs, viruses, hijackers, spyware,
and other malware set themselves to start automatically when Windows starts.
As more and more programs are started automatically, your computer's valuable resources are drained,
causing your computer to operate slowly.
This database will allow you to search for programs that you find starting automatically
on your computer and determine if they are considered to be malware (harmful), optional,
unnecessary, or necessary to run. To examine your computer for programs that are
automatically started by Windows, you can download and install Autoruns by Sysinternals.
You can then search for entries found in the programs output using this database
to determine if the program should be running.
If from the information you decide they are not necessary to run,
you can uncheck that entry in the Autoruns program and it will no longer start.
Each entry in the database will have a status assigned to it. The key to this status is the following:
Y - This status flag means that this entry should be left alone and
be allowed to run as if it is unchecked it may break the functionality or use of a particular program.
N - This status flag means it is unnecessary to run this program
automatically when Windows starts as you can run it manually when necessary.
U - This status flag means it is up to you whether or not you feel
this program needs to run automatically.
X - This status flags means the item should definitely not start
up automatically. Items that have this flag are generally malware such as viruses,
trojans, hijackers, spyware, etc.
? - This status flag means the status of this entry is
unknown at this time and more research is necessary.
If you require assistance in removing one of these files you can ask us in the Startup Database Forum.
