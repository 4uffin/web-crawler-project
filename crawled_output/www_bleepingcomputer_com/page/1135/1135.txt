CTB-Faker Ransomware does a poor job imitating CTB-Locker
A new ransomware called CTB-Faker was discovered that pretends to be the CTB-Locker ransomware. It is a poor imitator, though, as instead of encrypting a victim's files, it will move them instead into a password protected ZIP archive.  CTB-Faker will then demand a ransom of  $50 USD in bitcoins.
