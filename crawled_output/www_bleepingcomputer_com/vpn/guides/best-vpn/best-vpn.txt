Our expert team has tested dozens of VPNs, looking at everything from streaming capabilities and speed to security and privacy. Here are the best VPNs of 2025.
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a crucial tool for safeguarding your online privacy and accessing content that is restricted—whether in your country or on the network you’re using. With hundreds of VPNs to choose from, finding a reliable VPN can be tough. In this guide, we’ve done the hard work for you by pinpointing the best VPNs currently available.
Our recommendations were expertly selected using carefully chosen criteria to ensure they effectively prevent online tracking by ISPs, governments, local WiFi networks, and websites. These VPNs effectively bypass censorship, region locks, and even website blocks at work or on campus. These VPNs also excel at accessing international streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+.
While many VPNs are mediocre, and some even compromise your security by selling your data to third parties, this guide highlights reputable providers that cater to diverse needs. Some VPNs excel in speed and security, while others are particularly effective at bypassing region-locked streams. You can choose the VPN that best suits your needs and preferences.
In this guide, you’ll learn how we tested and analyzed dozens of leading VPN providers to find the very best.

Selecting VPNs is no small feat, especially when there are literally thousands of providers out there. However, we were able to significantly narrow the field by being ruthless with our inclusion criteria. Here are some of the non-negotiable characteristics we looked for:
Has minimal impact on connection speed
Offers (at minimum) 256-bit encryption, a kill switch, and leak protection
Refuses to log any personally identifiable information and preferably keeps no logs at all
Gives users a good choice of locations to choose from
Can securely access popular streaming services
Provides a high standard of customer support at no additional cost
Works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS
In order to qualify for one of the top three positions, the VPN provider must operate a 100% diskless server network and have had its infrastructure audited by a reputable third party

Best VPN in 2025: Detailed reviews
A brief overview is great, but to really understand what a VPN service has to offer, we have to take a closer look. Here's a more detailed examination of the best VPNs of the year.
1. NordVPN
Website: www.nordvpn.com
OS: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Smart TVs, Linux
Money Back Guarantee: 30 days
Speed: 7.5/10
Value for Money: 9/10
Streaming: 10/10
Ease of use: 10/10
Privacy: 10/10
Customer Support: 10/10
NordVPN stands out as the best VPN in 2025, offering a robust combination of security, speed, and usability. Following extensive testing, we found that NordVPN consistently delivers top-tier performance across a variety of use cases, which makes it the best option for most home users or people who need a VPN to bypass blocks at work.
Security and privacy
NordVPN excels in security, featuring powerful encryption protocols, including the highly secure AES 256-bit encryption (via OpenVPN) and the optimized ChaCha20 algorithm (via NordLynx). We confirmed the reliability of its privacy settings by testing the VPN for leaks.
We were also happy to find out that NordVPN has been independently audited by Deloitte. This is a highly reputable firm, meaning you can completely trust the infrastructure, apps, and no-logging policy offered by NordVPN to ensure your online activities remain confidential at all times.
NordVPN operates a self-implemented network of diskless servers, meaning no data is stored on physical drives, and all information is wiped with every reboot. Another advantage; diskless VPN servers are in a state of constant flux. This means that as data passes through the server, it replaces the data that came before, resulting in active data minimization on the server.
During our tests, NordVPN’s advanced privacy tools were impressive. The obfuscated servers concealed our VPN use, which allowed us to connect to the VPN while simultaneously preventing our network administrator from detecting VPN use. This makes the VPN extremely useful for bypassing censorship on restrictive networks or in countries like China and Iran.
The Double VPN feature adds an extra layer of encryption, providing enhanced protection against time correlation attacks, although we will note that both the MultiHop and obfuscation features did result in slightly slower speeds. We'd recommend only turning these features on if you need them, as the regular encrypted connection is secure enough for the majority of use cases.
Performance and speed
Speed is a critical factor, and NordVPN did not disappoint. We tested the VPN using a test server with a Gigabit connection and using a regular home broadband setup to give you an idea of how it will perform under a regular home setting.
Our server-based tests showed that the service maintained an average download speed of 197 Mbps, making it one of the fastest VPNs we’ve ever reviewed. NordVPN also maintained fantastic speeds across the different locations we tested globally, ensuring smooth HD streaming and quick browsing.
To provide practical insight into NordVPN's performance on a typical home broadband connection, we conducted tests using an Asus Zenbook 14 laptop. On the testing day, without the VPN, the download speed was recorded at 35 Mbps on a Cogeco broadband connection in the UK.
Here are the results of our speed tests when connected to various NordVPN servers in the UK, US, and Hong Kong:
UK server #2256: Achieved a download speed of 33.75 Mbps, reflecting a 3.57% decrease.
US server #8401: Achieved a download speed of 32.92 Mbps, reflecting a 5.94% decrease.
Hong Kong server #297: Achieved a download speed of 34.62 Mbps, reflecting a 1.09% decrease.
As you can see, I still enjoyed decent speeds for streaming even when connected to NordVPN on home broadband.
Features
NordVPN’s split tunneling feature also proved useful during our testing. It allowed us to route specific apps through the VPN while keeping others on a regular internet connection, providing flexibility without compromising security. I used split tunneling to watch local TV in my browser while downloading a torrent safely through the VPN tunnel.
We also tested NordVPN’s auto-connect feature, which automatically activates the VPN when using public WiFi hotspots, ensuring your connection remains secure on the go.
The system-level kill switch also performed reliably, cutting off internet access to specific apps or the entire device if the VPN connection dropped, which is crucial for maintaining anonymity.
Note that although torrenting is allowed throughout NordVPN’s network, there is no port forwarding feature. If you specifically need port forwarding for seeding, opt for a recommendation that includes this feature.
Global server network
NordVPN has more than 7,800 servers in 118+ countries, which is impressive global coverage. This global presence ensures that you can reliably access geo-restricted content from nearly anywhere in the world.
We enjoyed the app’s detailed server map, which makes it easy to select servers. If you prefer to pick a server in a specific location, you can use the search function.
Streaming
Our extensive testing confirmed NordVPN’s exceptional streaming capabilities. It seamlessly accessed popular global streaming services, including Hulu, HBO Max, ESPN Plus, Disney+, BBC iPlayer (and other popular British streams), as well as over a dozen Netflix regions. The service's ability to bypass geo-restrictions was very consistent, making it a top choice for streaming fans.
Ease of use
NordVPN’s apps are available on all major platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire TV. During our usability tests, we found the apps to be intuitive and well-designed.
For devices that don’t support VPN apps natively, such as smart TVs or gaming consoles, NordVPN can be set up on compatible routers. The setup process is straightforward, thanks to the detailed instructions available on its website. However, if you don't feel confident following the steps, you can opt to purchase a pre-configured router from FlashRouters.
Finally, NordVPN’s Panama-based operation means it’s outside jurisdictions with invasive data retention laws, further solidifying its commitment to privacy. Live chat support is available 24/7, which means you will always be looked after. Plus, you can try the VPN yourself and compare it to any other VPN you like the sound of using its 30-day money-back guarantee.
Buy this VPN if you are looking for:
A user-friendly interface that’s simple enough for beginners yet flexible enough for experienced users.
Continually evolving security tools that keep your data safe.
A VPN with an audited zero-logs policy for maximum privacy.
Access to over 7,800 servers in 118+ countries for global coverage.
A diskless infrastructure that ensures no data is stored on physical drives.
Don't buy this VPN if:
You require a VPN with a port forwarding feature.
BEST OVERALL VPN: NordVPN takes the top spot thanks to its versatility, ease of use, and consistent performance. Easily accesses most major streaming services. Offers a risk-free 30-day money-back guarantee.

2. Surfshark
Website: www.surfshark.com
OS: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Smart TVs, Linux
Money Back Guarantee: 30 days
Speed: 7/10
Value for Money: 9/10
Streaming: 10/10
Ease of use: 10/10
Privacy: 9.8/10
Customer Support: 10/10
Surfshark is a close second to NordVPN for a variety of reasons. We particularly recommend this VPN to users who are on a slightly tighter budget but still want a highly reliable VPN with robust security, extensive server coverage, and impressive streaming capabilities.
Through rigorous testing, we found Surfshark to be a highly versatile VPN that caters to both beginners and advanced users, making it a solid choice for internet users regardless of their privacy or unblocking needs.
Security and privacy
Surfshark takes user data privacy seriously. The VPN comes equipped with strong encryption protocols like AES-256 (via OpenVPN) and the ChaCha20 algorithm (via WireGuard). Our IP, DNS, and WebRTC leak tests confirmed that Surfshark effectively prevents all leaks, which means the VPN is completely secure for privacy purposes.
We were pleased to find that Surfshark operates a network of diskless servers, meaning no data is stored on physical drives. This allows the VPN to remotely erase all data passing through any server by pulling the plug, which safeguards against the potential of government raids or other emergencies.
Surfshark also has a rotating IP feature that you can use to automatically change your IP address at set intervals. This makes it harder for websites to track you. This is particularly useful for enhancing privacy, though for streaming and accessing any services that might get confused if your IP address changes mid-session, you would probably prefer sticking to a single IP address each session.
A MultiHop feature allows you to bounce through two servers, which encrypts your data twice en route to its final destination.
Surfshark’s privacy-first approach is underscored by a no-logs policy that has been thoroughly audited by Deloitte. The VPN has also had its apps and infrastructure audited by Cure53, another reputable security auditing firm. These audits confirmed that the VPN performs as advertised for privacy and security purposes.
The VPN also offers a NoBorders mode, which obfuscates your VPN traffic, allowing you to bypass censorship in restrictive regions like China. We tested this feature to prevent our local network admin from blocking access to and detecting VPN use. This makes Surfshark a reliable choice for maintaining privacy and bypassing censorship – even if you travel to China.
We also tested the kill switch to ensure it works as advertised. We discovered that the kill switch works at the system level on Windows and will completely prevent all traffic leaving your devices without the protection of the VPN.
Performance and speed
During our speed tests, Surfshark delivered excellent results, proving to be fast enough for data-intensive activities like HD streaming, gaming, and torrenting.
We tested Surfshark using dedicated test servers and a standard home broadband connection. Both tests were superb, uncovering only a minimal speed reduction and superb consistency throughout the day.
Surfshark’s ability to maintain high speeds across its global network makes it an excellent option for users who require consistent performance. Whether connected to UK, US, or global servers, Surfshark maintained impressive speeds, which is crucial for both everyday browsing and data-intensive activities.
Next, we tested the VPN on an Asus Zenbook 14 laptop. On the day of testing, the connection speed without the VPN was 35 Mbps, using Cogeco broadband in Canada. Below are the results from our tests while connected to servers in the UK, US, and Hong Kong:
UK (London server): Download speed of 33.76 Mbps, representing a 3.54% decrease.
US (New York server): Download speed of 28.24 Mbps, representing a 19.31% decrease.
Hong Kong server: Download speed of 30.26 Mbps, representing a 13.60% decrease.
My home tests reveal that Surfshark kept my internet running fast enough to stream in HD and play games – impressive considering the price point of US$2.49 per month.
Features
Surfshark offers a wide range of advanced features that cater to both privacy-conscious users and those seeking an enhanced streaming experience. The split tunneling feature allows you to route specific apps through the VPN while others use your regular internet connection, providing flexibility without compromising security. This is particularly useful for tasks like streaming local content while torrenting securely through the VPN.
The provider’s user-friendly apps are available on all major platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire TV. The apps are intuitive, with essential settings conveniently located on a single page, making it easy to navigate even for beginners. For devices that don't support VPN apps natively, you can set up Surfshark on a VPN-compatible router.
Surfshark also uses DNS-based filtering called CleanWeb to block ads, trackers, and malicious websites, which not only makes you more secure but also saves on data and improves page load times.
Global server network
Surfshark boasts a massive global server network with over 3,200 servers in 100+ countries. This extensive coverage ensures that you can reliably access geo-restricted content from almost anywhere in the world.
Surfshark offers static IPs at no extra cost, with an option for dedicated IPs available for an extra fee. The dedicated IP feature may be beneficial for certain use cases, but it's not necessary for unblocking streaming services and most users’ needs. The inclusion of static IPs is also excellent because it allows you to access accounts and services using a consistent IP address, which helps to avoid accounts being flagged for suspicious activity.
Streaming
Surfshark is particularly well-suited for streaming, with its reliable UK servers making it easy to access various Netflix regions, Hulu, HBO Max, ESPN, Peacock, Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, and many other popular services (it worked in more than 10 different Netflix regions when we tested it).
Our extensive testing showed that Surfshark is capable of streaming HD content without buffering, making it a top choice for streaming fans on a budget. Additionally, Surfshark’s support for an unlimited number of devices means that you and your family can stream different shows simultaneously without any issues.
Ease of use
Surfshark’s apps are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a focus on providing both simplicity for beginners and flexibility for advanced users. The interface is straightforward, with the most important settings accessible from a single page, making it easy to configure your VPN quickly.
Its live chat support is available 24/7, ensuring that you have help whenever you need it. Additionally, Surfshark offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.
Buy this VPN if you are looking for:
A budget-friendly VPN with strong performance for streaming and gaming.
A VPN that supports an unlimited number of devices on a single subscription.
Advanced privacy features like IP rotation, static IPs, and diskless servers.
A VPN that balances affordability with top-tier service and extensive global coverage.
Don't buy this VPN if:
You prefer a VPN that doesn’t advertise add-on security features in its app.
BEST BUDGET VPN: Surfshark is our favorite low-cost option for streaming and privacy. It’s quick, versatile, and works with a huge number of streaming services. You can pick between a choice of protocols and access robust privacy features, including a kill switch and ad blocking. Better still, it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

3. ExpressVPN
Website: www.expressvpn.com
OS: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Smart TVs, Linux
Money Back Guarantee: 30 days
Speed: 6/10
Value for Money: 6/10
Streaming: 9/10
Ease of use: 10/10
Privacy: 9.5/10
Customer Support: 6/10
ExpressVPN is a popular VPN that was first launched back in 2009. That makes it one of the longest-running consumer VPNs available on the market. The VPN has an excellent reputation for privacy and is known for fast speed, reliable security features, and a user-friendly design.
Following extensive testing, we found that ExpressVPN consistently delivers fantastic performance, however, it is a touch more expensive than our top choices, which is why we placed it in a lower position in our list of the best VPNs.
Security and privacy
ExpressVPN puts user privacy first. It provides a choice of protocols, including OpenVPN with AES-256 encryption. The OpenVPN protocol has been implemented with obfuscation by default. This ensures that the VPN works in countries like China and that you can use the VPN without ISPs noticing.
A standout feature of ExpressVPN is its proprietary Lightway protocol, which is designed to be lightweight and efficient while maintaining high levels of security. The protocol is open-source and has been independently audited, which means that we can trust the protocol to work as intended for privacy purposes.
As with our top recommendations, ExpressVPN employs RAM-only servers across its network. This ensures that no user data is ever stored long-term on physical drives. Every time a server is rebooted, all data is wiped, and even during active use, the RAM-only server is constantly being overwritten with new data.
Users also get access to a Network Lock feature (kill switch) that blocks all internet traffic if the VPN connection drops. This ensures that you never leak unprotected data to local networks, ISPs, government snoops, or any other eavesdroppers.
ExpressVPN’s no-logs policy has been independently verified through multiple audits. This means you can trust the VPN to work as advertised, which is great. Moreover, ExpressVPN is based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), a jurisdiction with no mandatory data retention laws or invasive intelligence agencies.
As always, we performed leak tests to check that the VPN is working properly. As you can see, the VPN did not reveal my real IP address (in Canada) during any of the tests. This means the VPN is reliable for gaining online privacy.
Performance and speed
In our speed tests, ExpressVPN demonstrated consistent performance. We tested it using a dedicated server with a 1 Gigabit connection to find its top speed across various global locations. You can see the results of those tests below:
Next, we carried out speed tests of the VPN using an Asus Zenbook 14 laptop. This gives you an idea of how the VPN will perform under a normal home setting. On the day of testing, my Cogeco broadband connection in Canada had a baseline speed of 35 Mbps. Below are the results of tests conducted while connected to servers in the UK, US, and Hong Kong:
UK (London server): Download speed of 31.68 Mbps, representing a 9.49% decrease.
US (New York server): Download speed of 32.83 Mbps, representing a 6.20% decrease.
Hong Kong server: Download speed of 32.14 Mbps, representing a 8.17% decrease.
These results reveal that ExpressVPN provides ideal speeds for HD streaming, gaming, and making private video calls (as well as for using VoIP apps in countries where they are blocked).
The apps also come with a useful Smart Location feature that automatically connects you to the fastest available server. This helps you to find the optimal server for your location.
During our tests, ExpressVPN proved to be fast enough to handle multiple online activities simultaneously, making it a reliable choice for both everyday use and more demanding tasks like streaming or torrenting.
Features
The VPN’s split tunneling feature works to run some things through the VPN while other apps access the internet directly. This flexibility is particularly useful for tasks like streaming local content while keeping other activities secure through the VPN.
ExpressVPN also includes DNS-based filtering under its Advanced Protection settings, which blocks ads, trackers, and malicious websites. This feature not only enhances security but also helps to speed up page load times and reduce data usage.
You can also use DNS-based filtering to block adult sites, which allows the VPN to double up as a parental control service.
In addition to its custom apps for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire TV, ExpressVPN also offers an app for routers, enabling you to protect every device on your home network.
Global server network
ExpressVPN operates a robust network of RAM-only servers, 3,000+ across 105+ countries, providing extensive global coverage.
This makes it an ideal choice for users who need to access geo-restricted content from different regions around the world. Whether you’re streaming BBC iPlayer from abroad or accessing Netflix libraries from multiple countries, ExpressVPN ensures a reliable connection.
Streaming
In our tests, the VPN worked to watch 20+ Netflix regions, Hulu, HBO Max, ESPN, Prime Video, Peacock, BBC iPlayer, and many others.
The only slight drawback compared to some of our other recommendations is that Express doesn't list streaming-optimized servers. This might cause you to need to test various servers in the required country to find one that works. That said, the 24/7 live chat support is always available to assist you in selecting the best server, and from our experience, most of the US servers work with all streaming services.
You also get a free Smart DNS service called MediaStreamer, which works to unlock US streaming services on any device that won't let you install a VPN directly, such as a console or smart TV.
During our streaming tests, the VPN consistently allowed us to stream in HD without any buffering or lag. This makes ExpressVPN a top choice for users who want to access home streams on vacation.
Ease of use
ExpressVPN’s apps are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with most settings accessible from a single page. This simplicity makes it easy for beginners to get started, however, it might seem a bit lacking to advanced users, especially considering that the VPN is the most costly of the best VPNs on the market.
For users who need assistance, ExpressVPN offers 24/7 live chat support as well as a comprehensive support library and video guides on its YouTube channel. Additionally, ExpressVPN’s app for routers makes it easy to protect all devices in your home with minimal setup.
Buy this VPN if you are looking for:
A VPN that’s easy to set up on your home router and works across all major platforms.
Simple and user-friendly apps for connecting to servers worldwide.
Reliable access to BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, and other UK services from abroad.
Consistent speeds for streaming HD content without buffering.
A VPN proven to work with a wide variety of streaming platforms globally.
Don't buy this VPN if:
You’re on a tight budget (ExpressVPN is a premium service with higher pricing).
You’re looking for advanced features like MultiHop servers or port forwarding.
RELIABLE SPEEDS: ExpressVPN is fast and secure, making it perfect for unblocking global streaming services on vacation or at work. It offers top-notch security, reliable download speeds, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.

4. IPVanish
Website: www.ipvanish.com
OS: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Smart TVs
Money Back Guarantee: 30 days
Speed: 8/10
Value for Money: 8/10
Streaming: 6/10
Ease of use: 9.5/10
Privacy: 8/10
Customer Support: 6/10
IPVanish is a US-based VPN provider that has been growing in popularity. The VPN has been improving consistently over the years, and now offers fast speeds, a wide server network, and robust security features.
We found IPVanish to be one of the quickest VPNs on the market, which makes it suitable for users who want to stream, torrent, or play games. A standout feature is its unlimited device connection allowance, which makes it a superb choice for families.
Security and privacy
IPVanish offers OpenVPN with industry-standard 256-bit AES encryption to ensure your data remains securely locked in the VPN tunnel. It also includes essential privacy tools such as DNS and IPv6 leak protection and a kill switch, which blocks all internet traffic if the VPN connection drops. For users looking for faster speeds WireGuard with ChaCha20 is also available.
Another key feature is IPVanish’s Scramble feature, which obfuscates OpenVPN traffic, making your VPN connection appear as regular web traffic. This is beneficial for avoiding detection on networks that block or throttle VPN usage. However, it's important to note that IPVanish does not work in China.
Besides offering obfuscation, IPVanish also lets you pick which port to connect with when using OpenVPN. This can help to bypass VPN blocks on certain networks.
IPVanish passed all of our leak tests, confirming that there were no IP, DNS, or WebRTC leaks when connected to the VPN. This means you can completely trust the VPN for privacy purposes.
Performance and speed
We thoroughly tested IPVanish to see how it performs for data-intensive tasks like HD streaming and gaming. We started by testing its network using a dedicated test server in Ohio. Testing with a 1 Gigabit line allows us to check the VPN’s top speeds.
As you can see, the IPVanish speeds were excellent. An average of 268 Mbps puts it in line with some of the best VPNs we have ever tested. The only slight caveat is that the results were a little mixed over the day, with some results coming out much faster than others. However, even the slowest speed encountered is much faster than the average user needs.
Next, we decided to check how it would perform under a normal home setting. We performed another speed test using an Asus Zenbook 14 laptop connected to a Cogeco home broadband in Canada. On the day of testing, my baseline internet speed without the VPN was 35 Mbps.
Below are the results from the tests:
UK (London server): Download speed of 31.38 Mbps, indicating a 10.34% decrease.
US (New York server): Download speed of 32.90 Mbps, indicating a 6.00% decrease.
Hong Kong server: Download speed of 27.10 Mbps, indicating a 22.57% decrease.
These speeds are more than sufficient for HD streaming, gaming, and torrenting without buffering or lag. The only drawback is that the Hong Kong server consistently performed slower than the other location we tested, so keep this in mind if servers in Asia are your #1 priority.

IPVanish has all the features you'd expect from a leading VPN brand. All subscribers get access to a choice of protocols with robust encryption, a kill switch, and DNS leak protection. The VPN also comes with an auto-connect feature, ensuring your connection is automatically secured when you join public WiFi.
We were particularly impressed by the attempt to reconnect feature. It works alongside the kill switch to restore your connection automatically, allowing uninterrupted activities like torrenting even if you are away from your computer.
The service offers split tunneling on Windows, Android, and FireOS, which allows you to choose which apps use the VPN and which use the regular internet connection.
Global server network
IPVanish has a decent network of 2,400+ self-owned servers across 140+ locations worldwide, which is admittedly fewer than our other recommendations.
The apps also show you which servers are physical and which are virtual locations (provided with clever DNS routing), which gives you clear visibility over how your data is being processed.
Information about server load is displayed to help you pick the server with the best performance. IPVanish also lets you access the same IP address each session, which is ideal if you want to access services using the same IP address each time.
Streaming
IPVanish has made a big offer to improve its service for streaming. In our tests, the VPN successfully worked to watch BBC iPlayer, Netflix UK, Channel 4, ITVX, and Netflix USA, with no noticeable drop in quality.
Although IPVanish works successfully to watch most US services, we recommend testing it with international platforms using the 30-day money-back guarantee. Some users complain that the service is a little US-centric, so it may not work as well with international streaming platforms.
Ease of use
IPVanish is a user-friendly VPN with apps available on all major platforms. The VPN’s interface provides useful connection details like server load, upload/download speeds, and IP address. You can also use the Smart Location feature to help you pick the best server.
IPVanish offers 24/7 live chat support, which means you can get help with setting up and using the VPN. If you get a bot, ask to be forwarded to a human agent – there is always one around.
Buy this VPN if you are looking for:
A fast, consistent VPN with high speeds for streaming, gaming, and torrenting.
Unlimited device connections on a single plan, allowing you to protect all your devices or share the VPN with family members.

5. CyberGhost
Website: www.cyberghost.com
OS: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android
Money Back Guarantee: 45 days
Speed: 9/10
Value for Money: 10/10
Streaming: 8/10
Ease of use: 10/10
Privacy: 9/10
Customer Support: 9/10
CyberGhost VPN is a service based in Romania that is perfect for beginners on a budget in need of a simple VPN. The VPN is easier to use, while still providing the main features that VPN users want. It offers fast speeds and has a massive server network. The drawback? It lacks some advanced features, but its simplicity and solid performance make it a popular choice for home users.
Security and privacy
CyberGhost VPN delivers reliable privacy features that ensure everything you do online remains private. You can connect using a choice of protocols: OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IKEv2. These all provide trusted encryption algorithms. Despite being affordable, this VPN has a system-level kill switch, DNS leak protection, and a no-logging policy.
The provider also offers Smart Rules, which lets you customize your connection to work with specific apps or when using public WiFi. This is useful if you frequently switch networks and need to stay safe on the move.
CyberGhost has undergone independent audits and publishes quarterly transparency reports. This increases transparency and means you can be sure the VPN is working as advertised to provide data security online.
The main drawback is that you do not get obfuscation. This makes CyberGhost less reliable when attempting to connect on strict networks or while visiting countries that implement VPN blocks. If you intend to travel to China, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, or any other country with widespread restrictions, we recommend opting for a more advanced VPN higher in the list.
Performance and speed
In terms of speed, CyberGhost performs incredibly well for the price point. This is why we recommend it to home users in need of a VPN for gaming, streaming, or making video calls. We tested it using our dedicated test server and found it to have an average download speed of 289 Mbps –  which means it easily outperforms most consumer VPNs currently on the market.
To evaluate how CyberGhost VPN performs on a regular home internet, we ran tests using Cogeco home broadband in Canada. The tests were conducted using the Ookla Speedtest app on an Asus Zenbook 14 Pro laptop. The results from our tests are as follows (the baseline without the VPN was 35 Mbps):
UK (London server): Download speed of 25.53 Mbps, representing a 27.06% decrease.
US (New York server): Download speed of 29.38 Mbps, representing a 16.06% decrease.
Hong Kong server: Download speed of 29.4 Mbps, representing a 16% decrease.
As you can see, the VPN performed well for its price range. The UK server was the slowest and still provided reliable speeds for HD streaming. CyberGhost VPN’s performance is bolstered by its use of the WireGuard protocol – the fastest VPN protocol available for streaming and other data-intensive activities.
Features
CyberGhost offers useful and reliable VPN features, especially considering it starts at just US$2.03 per month. Each subscriber can connect up to seven devices consecutively, which is usually sufficient for most power users and families.
The VPN’s Smart Rules feature allows users to configure the VPN to automatically connect when specific apps launch, ensuring you never forget to connect to the VPN when it is needed.
CyberGhost VPN also includes DNS-based ad, tracker, and malware blocking, which further enhances your privacy, improves browsing speeds, and saves on mobile data.
We found CyberGhost a breeze to use and enjoyed the apps and features. That said, you should keep in mind that this is a basic VPN. You will not find advanced features like MultiHop, port forwarding, or split tunneling. Thus, if you’re an advanced user who needs these things, consider one of our other recommendations.
Global server network
CyberGhost has a large global network with 11,500+ servers in over 100 countries, providing extensive coverage for users worldwide. You can pick from its server list based on location and use cases. It even includes streaming servers that are labeled for each country and service. This makes it extraordinarily easy to find the server you need.
You can also pick VPN servers for torrenting, streaming, or for privacy (NoSpy servers). The latter are specially hardened and self-hosted to ensure the highest possible level of privacy for activists, journalists, lawyers, and anybody else with an elevated threat model.
Dedicated and static IPs are available for an extra cost. These allow you to connect to the same IP address each session using a server that is reserved for your use only. This is better for accessing platforms that could flag your account if you log in from a variety of locations.
Streaming
CyberGhost is optimized for streaming, with dedicated servers for platforms in over a dozen countries. It works reliably with Netflix US, Hulu, HBO Max, BBC iPlayer, and many other popular streaming services. We checked the app and discovered streaming servers for 25+ different countries and 50+ streaming platforms.
During testing, CyberGhost maintained fast speeds and HD video quality without buffering, ensuring a seamless streaming experience.
Ease of use
CyberGhost is known for its beginner-friendly apps, available for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire TV. The VPN’s simple interface makes it easy for users to select servers and configure security settings.
For users who want to protect multiple devices with one connection, CyberGhost also provides detailed setup guides for routers that support OpenVPN. This ensures you can get protection on smart TVs, set-top boxes, consoles, and any other device that won't let you install a VPN directly.
For support, CyberGhost offers 24/7 live chat, which means you can ask questions and get help at any time of day and from anywhere in the world.
Buy this VPN if you are looking for:
A fast VPN with a large server network for streaming and general use.
An easy-to-use VPN with apps for all major platforms and a simple setup.
Strong privacy practices, including a no-logs policy and transparency reports.
A low-cost VPN with fast speeds.
A VPN that works with Netflix US.
Don’t buy this VPN if:
You need advanced features like MultiHop, port forwarding, or split tunneling.
You require obfuscation for use in heavily censored regions like China.
PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS: CyberGhost VPN is easy to use, fast, and secure, making it a great choice for users who want a simple, reliable VPN for streaming and browsing. With a generous 45-day money-back guarantee, it’s a low-risk option for most users.

6. Proton VPN
Website: www.protonvpn.com
OS: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Smart TVs, Linux
Money Back Guarantee: 30 days
Speed: 9/10
Value for Money: 7/10
Streaming: 8/10
Ease of use: 6/10

Customer Support: 7/10
Proton VPN is a popular service developed by the team behind Proton Mail, a secure email service previously recommended by Edward Snowden. The service is based in Switzerland, a privacy-friendly jurisdiction that has no mandatory data retention directives.
The VPN has completed third-party audits and is commonly a go-to choice for users who value strong privacy protections and open-source apps. Best of all, Proton VPN offers a high degree of customization and many advanced features.
Security and privacy
Proton VPN is rock solid when it comes to privacy. It uses AES-256 encryption, offers DNS and IPv6 leak protection, and includes a kill switch to protect your data in case the VPN connection drops.
The service also supports MultiHop connections, which route traffic through multiple servers for added security. For users concerned with censorship, Proton VPN provides obfuscation to disguise VPN traffic, and Tor over VPN for those needing an additional layer of anonymity.
The NetShield feature blocks ads, trackers, and malware, further enhancing security. Proton VPN has a strict no-logs policy and has undergone independent audits, solidifying its reputation as a privacy-first provider. Its servers are also full-disk encrypted, adding an extra layer of protection in case any server is seized.
Finally, users can opt to connect to its unique Secure Core servers. These servers are self-owned and hosted in hardened locations such as underground bunkers. Users who want the highest possible level of data security can choose to use these servers, but they will slow down your traffic slightly, so it's best to use these only when you genuinely have an elevated threat model.
We tested the VPN for IP, DNS, and WebRTC leaks to check that everything was working properly. As you can see in the results below, the VPN had a clean bill of health. This makes it completely reliable for gaining online privacy.
Performance and speed
Proton VPN might be reliable and secure, but it is also dedicated to providing a lightning-fast service. We tested servers in the US, UK, and Hong Kong using a dedicated test server and found it to have a global top download speed of 303 Mbps. This puts it in the top echelon of providers.
We then conducted tests on the VPN’s servers using a home broadband connection. For the tests, we used an Asus Zenbook laptop connected to Cogeco broadband in Canada. We used the desktop version of Ookla Speedtest, which is known for its reliability.
On the day of testing (we tested this and all the other VPNs specifically for this page, which is why the results may vary slightly from the test results in the ProtonVPN review), our connection speed without a VPN was 35 Mbps. Below are the results from our tests with the VPN enabled:
UK (London server): Download speed of 25.17 Mbps, representing a 28.09% drop.
US (New York server): Download speed of 32.19 Mbps, representing a 8.03% drop.
Hong Kong server: Download speed of 16.98 Mbps, representing a 51.49% drop.
As you can see, our home tests were a little disappointing. The Hong Kong server halved the speed of our internet, and the UK server also performed substantially worse than the US server location. The speeds encountered are still fine for streaming in HD, but we ultimately felt that Proton had to feature lower in our list of best VPNs due to these slightly slower speeds.
All things considered, we are slightly skeptical about ProtonVPN’s advertised “Accelerator” technology. The provider claims that this uses multiple processor cores to boost its speeds, but the results of our tests did not really make it stand out from the pack.
Features
Proton VPN is feature-rich, which is why it is popular with advanced users. It offers a wide range of customization options, including split tunneling to decide which apps use the VPN and which access the internet directly, port forwarding, and P2P optimized servers, making it an excellent option for torrenting, plus MultiHop for added protection, a kill switch to prevent any leaks, and Tor over VPN for anybody wanting to access the Dark Web without being tracked.
Just bear in mind that the port forwarding opens one random port per session, which means you’ll need to set that specific number in your torrent client each session. This can feel a little laborious, but the fact that you get PF with every subscription is beneficial and Proton claims it has valid security reasons for doing things this way.
For added convenience, the VPN allows users to create custom profiles, enabling quick connections to specific server types, such as P2P-optimized or streaming servers. You can easily find the type of server you need in the list because Proton uses symbols to define each server’s capabilities.
Proton VPN also lets you use private DNS servers from within the app. Proton VPN also does a superb job of providing real-time connection details like VPN IP, server load, and protocol. Plus, you can see the port forwarding number displayed alongside this info:
Global server network
Proton VPN offers 12,000+ servers in 117+ countries, providing broad global coverage for users who need to bypass geographic restrictions or access content from different regions. Its Secure Core servers, located in secure, hardened facilities, offer an extra layer of protection for users concerned about government surveillance.
Whether you’re accessing streaming platforms or protecting your privacy, Proton VPN’s extensive network ensures you have the option you need. You can also pick your server using its nifty map feature, which makes it easy to test servers all around the globe to access local services.
Streaming
Proton VPN is a decent option for streaming, with servers optimized for platforms in multiple countries. During testing, Proton VPN successfully accessed many popular streaming services, including Netflix US, Hulu, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video.
If you need a streaming-optimized server, look for the triangle play symbol next to the server (highlighted in orange in the screenshot above).
Ease of use
Proton VPN is available on all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux. Users can connect up to 10 devices simultaneously, which is plenty for most households. We also found the apps to be user-friendly. It offers information about each feature in the app, which helps to explain even its more advanced features.
Proton’s free plan, which has no bandwidth cap, makes it particularly appealing for users who want to test the service before committing to a paid plan. The free plan will provide the same level of privacy as a paid account, albeit without access to some of its more advanced features (and streaming servers, which are reserved for paying users).
Buy this VPN if you are looking for:
A privacy-focused VPN with advanced features like Secure Core, MultiHop, and Tor over VPN.
A fast VPN with servers in 117+ countries and excellent global coverage.
A highly customizable VPN with options like split tunneling, port forwarding, and profile creation.
A no-logs policy and a strong commitment to privacy.
Don’t buy this VPN if:
You need a VPN with deep discounts on long-term subscriptions.
You want a provider that offers unlimited simultaneous connections.
ADVANCED FEATURES: Proton VPN offers top-tier privacy features and strong global coverage, making it an ideal option for users who value security and customization. With a free plan and a 30-day money-back guarantee, it’s a great choice for both casual users and privacy advocates.

7. Mullvad
Website: https://mullvad.net
OS: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android
Money Back Guarantee: 30 days
Speed: 10/10
Value for Money: 6/10
Streaming: 4/10
Ease of use: 8.9/10
Privacy: 10/10
Customer Support: 7/10
Mullvad is a smaller VPN provider from Sweden that is highly popular with techy users and privacy advocates who prefer a VPN that has never worked with affiliates. The VPN is known for its steadfast focus on privacy, simplicity, and transparency.
It offers a flat-rate pricing structure that has remained unchanged for over a decade, though that cost may be off-putting for some people because it is quite high for what you get.
Security and privacy
Mullvad is a service that is dedicated to user privacy. Unlike most of its competitors, it doesn’t use the typical username and password combination. Instead, users get a secret account number to log in. No personal information is required to create an account. This allows for complete anonymity during registration and use. You can even pay by sending cash through the post to ensure the account can’t be tied to you by a payment processor.
Mullvad employs AES-256 or ChaCha20, depending on whether users connect via OpenVPN or WireGuard protocols. It also includes essential features like DNS leak protection, obfuscation, and an always-on kill switch, ensuring that your data remains private even if the VPN connection drops.
We tested the leak protection and found the VPN to be completely secure.
Mullvad offers support for IPv6 connections, which is not offered by many of its competitors. You can also set the VPN to block gambling sites and adult content, meaning it doubles as a parental control application.
Mullvad has completed independent audits of its infrastructure and policies. It also clearly differentiates between owned and rented servers, and whether servers are running on RAM or disks, which makes it easier for people to gain the level of protection they require for the task at hand.
Performance and speed
During our tests, Mullvad delivered impressive speeds, making it a solid choice for day-to-day activities like browsing and torrenting. However, the absence of port forwarding—once a key feature for torrent users—diminishes its effectiveness for those looking to maximize upload speeds for seeding.
These server speeds are absolutely outstanding and reveal that Mullvad is managing its network capacity exceptionally well. This should mean that Mullvad keeps the average subscriber's internet running at close to its usual speed without the VPN.
To check whether this is true in practice, we carried out home tests using a Cogeco broadband connection in Canada. Again, we tested at three different times of day to get an average for each location. Below you can see the results of those home broadband tests:
UK (London server): Download speed of 24.54 Mbps. This is a 29.89% drop.
US (New York server): Download speed of 33.16 Mbps. This is a 5.26% drop.
Hong Kong server: Download speed of 22.33 Mbps. This is a 36.2% drop.
As you can see, the results were pretty good. However, it was not the fastest VPN under normal home conditions, even though it had very fast top speeds in our server-based tests. Despite this, the VPN offers good performance for data-intensive tasks like streaming, torrenting, and gaming.
Features
Mullvad has a simple, no-frills approach to features, focusing heavily on privacy and security.
The VPN provides split tunneling, allowing users to choose which apps use the VPN and which bypass it.
It supports obfuscation for bypassing network restrictions, but it no longer works in China due to government restrictions.
Mullvad supports P2P on all servers. However, Mullvad no longer includes port forwarding, which was previously one of its main attractions for torrent users. The removal of this feature has reduced its appeal for those who rely on port forwarding for seeding torrents.
It has introduced server-based ad and tracker blocking, which helps to reduce page load times and mobile data use, and helps to give you an extra layer of privacy online.
Mullvad’s flat rate of €5 per month ($5.20 USD) used to be pretty competitive, but as the VPN market evolves, this fee has started to feel a bit too high. Many competing VPNs now offer similar (or even more comprehensive) features—such as streaming-optimized servers, MultiHop, and ad-blocking—at comparable or even lower prices.
The provider suggests additional browser plugins to enhance privacy during web browsing. This support helps users avoid different layers of online trackers and helps to educate them about best practices for securing their data online.
Global server network
Mullvad operates 724+ servers across various global locations, including 20+ different cities in the US. The provider is highly transparent about which servers are owned and which are rented, and whether they are running on RAM or disks. This gives users the ability to pick the best server for their needs, whether they are trying to gain privacy or bypass blocks.
While this level of data is commendable, the relatively small server network is more limited compared to other major VPN providers, which often boast thousands of servers in dozens of countries.
Mullvad’s transparency and infrastructure are ideal for users focused on privacy and security, but the limited network means that users may experience congestion or slower speeds, which can be off-putting considering the cost of a subscription.
Streaming
Mullvad is not optimized for streaming and performs poorly with many popular streaming services. That said, we were able to access Netflix USA, which is many users’ priority. We could also watch the UK’s BBC iPlayer and Australia’s 10 Play.
However, during testing, Mullvad failed to reliably unblock Hulu, HBO Max, Disney Plus, and ABC. This means its ability to work with popular streaming services is severely limited. Bear in mind that we advise testing the VPN with your streaming services to be sure it is suitable.
Ease of use
Mullvad is available on all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux. The apps are simple and user-friendly, making it easy for privacy-conscious users to set up and navigate. The registration process, based solely on a secret account number, ensures anonymity and eliminates the need for personal data.
However, Mullvad’s lack of live chat support may be a drawback for users who prefer immediate assistance. Support is available through a knowledge base and email, but response times may be slower than desired.
Buy this VPN if you are looking for:
A privacy-first VPN with a flat-rate pricing model and no long-term commitments.
Strong security features like AES-256 encryption, obfuscation, and IPv6 support.
A simple and transparent service with regular independent audits.
Don’t buy this VPN if:
You need port forwarding for torrenting, as Mullvad has discontinued this feature.
You’re primarily looking for a VPN to unblock streaming services.
You want advanced features that are now standard in many competing VPNs at similar price points.
A SOLID PERFORMER: Mullvad is an excellent option for privacy-conscious users, offering transparency, security, and consistent speeds. However, it falls short in streaming and lacks advanced features found in similarly priced VPNs, making it a less competitive choice in today’s market. Offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Testing methodology: How we chose the best VPN services
At BleepingComputer, we use a carefully curated VPN testing methodology to find the best VPNs. Our method has been refined over time and uses important metrics such as privacy features, performance, security, ease of use, and value for money to sort the wheat from the chaff.
To give you a transparent idea of how we arrived at our recommendations, we have included an outline of the methods and criteria we use below.
Speed testing
Most users agree that speed is a crucial aspect of any VPN. A slow VPN makes it impossible to stream, play games, and do other data-intensive tasks. Nobody wants to pay for fast internet, and then a fee on top of that for a VPN, only to find that the VPN is destroying their performance.
With this in mind, we carefully test VPNs using a series of tests. We perform server-based speed tests to figure out the VPN's average top speed. Then we run broadband-based tests to see how the VPN might perform for a regular home user on a laptop.
These tests are carried out multiple times a day – morning, noon, and evening.
For each VPN, we compare speeds when connected and not connected to the VPN, allowing us to measure the reduction in speed. We also test servers from various regions to evaluate global performance.
On the day of testing, our home broadband setup had a baseline internet speed of 35 Mbps. The best VPNs only lowered this by a few Mbps, meaning that it would be almost impossible for anybody to realize that the VPN is dropping their speed.
Of course, some VPNs fared worse than others, and some had better results in some locations. This is why you should use our results to pick the best VPN for your personal needs. If you need a fast connection to servers in Asia, you may decide on a different provider than someone who needs a fast VPN connection in the UK.
Streaming and content access
We test each VPN’s ability to unblock popular global streaming services, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+, and regional content from platforms like BBC iPlayer or Amazon Prime Video. Our experts have tested each VPN for compatibility with these services. We consider the ability to access these services, the quality of streaming, buffering issues, and connection stability.
VPNs that consistently bypass geo-restrictions and deliver high-quality streaming earn higher marks. In this guide, NordVPN performed particularly well in unblocking the largest variety of streaming services across different countries. Others, like Proton VPN, encountered occasional blocks or slower speeds.
Security and privacy
Security and privacy are the most crucial aspects of any VPN. Although many people seek a VPN for streaming, it is vital to understand that a VPN is a privacy service, and at BleepingComputer, we will never recommend a VPN based on accessibility alone.
With this in mind, we test each VPN’s ability to protect users’ data by examining its encryption standards, leak protection, and logging policies. We look for:
Encryption: AES-256 or higher for strong data protection.
Leak protection: DNS and IPv6 leak tests are conducted to ensure no data is exposed.
Kill switch: We assess whether the VPN’s kill switch reliably disconnects your internet if the VPN connection drops.
Logging policies: We investigate whether the VPN provider keeps any activity or IP logs. Providers with independently audited no-logs policies are rated higher.
Each VPN is tested against a range of security criteria, and results are compiled into a security score. To highlight VPNs that go the extra mile, we also consider third-party audits, diskless servers, and any advanced features that might set them apart.
Ease of use
A complicated VPN that confuses beginners is not going to appeal to the average home user. This is why we carefully analyze each VPN's website, application, and features to see whether they are easy to use.
We test each VPN’s interface, ease of installation, and availability across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, routers, etc.). We also mystery shop the support agents (live chat and email) to see how they cope.
We consider how easy it is to find the servers we need and test the advanced features to see not only that they work, but that a home user will be able to get it going without pulling out all their hair.
VPNs with clear, user-friendly designs—like CyberGhost and NordVPN—rank highly, while others may lose points for cluttered interfaces or overly complex settings.
Finally, we also check how easy it is to cancel a subscription or get a refund, ensuring that users are not subjected to unfair business practices.
Value for money
The cost of a VPN is often a terrible indicator of how good a VPN is. There are hundreds of VPNs on the market. There are expensive VPNs that cost more than $10 per month that are absolutely atrocious, and VPNs that cost $2 per month that are blinding.
To find our recommendations, we start by finding trustworthy VPNs that are genuinely secure. After that, we start to consider the cost of the VPN, eliminating any services that are overpriced for what you get.
To discover VPNs that represent overall value, we consider these key factors:
Money-back guarantees and free trials.
Connection limits (how many devices can be connected simultaneously).
Availability of discounts or special offers.
The range of features included in the price, such as advanced security tools, streaming capabilities, and server coverage.
To find out more about our evaluation process, please read our in-depth methodology guide.
What is a VPN?
A VPN is a service that protects your internet connection and privacy online. Normally, when you access a website or any other online service, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) receives your request and redirects you to your destination. A VPN reroutes all your internet traffic to a server that belongs to the VPN provider before sending it over to your destination. Importantly, it also encrypts your data before sending it to the VPN server. This stops local network administrators, your ISP, and government agencies from monitoring your web visits and your communications metadata.
You might be thinking: "But wait, I thought HTTPS encrypted my traffic, so why do I need a VPN?" It's a good question... both HTTPS and VPNs encrypt your data, but HTTPS only encrypts what is sent via a browser to a server and only if it’s enabled on the site you visit (most respectable sites do use HTTPS now). A VPN will encrypt all forms of internet traffic.
VPN connections also provide a host of other benefits. One of the most obvious is preventing websites and services from seeing your IP address. This is because your IP is replaced with the IP belonging to the VPN's remote server. This removes a significant layer of tracking when you surf the web, which helps to prevent profiling and IP-based results, such as targeted adverts or region-specific pricing.
Another benefit of being able to connect to an IP address in a remote location is that you can change your geographical location. For example, you can connect to a server abroad to watch foreign TV channels or connect to a VPN in a country of your choosing to access regional services.
A VPN can also help you bypass censorship in countries like China, where many Western services such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google are blocked. The same is true in countries like the UAE, where many websites and VoIP services are blocked.
A VPN also provides much more robust protection on public Wi-Fi hotspots. While HTTPS goes a long way to mitigating the risks of public hotspots, you are still vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as DNS spoofing and Punycode attacks. VPNs provide an additional layer of security.
Best VPNs FAQs
Do I really need a VPN?
After years of crypto, NFTs, and Web 3.0 shilling, it's only right that some people are skeptical of VPNs, especially since they're tools you pay for on a monthly basis. The reality is that if you only ever use the internet at home, never access sensitive files remotely, aren't worried about digital privacy, and don't travel abroad often, you may not need a VPN.
On the other hand, hundreds of millions of people do find VPNs valuable. In a world where our personal data is the biggest commodity going, they add a layer of privacy. Many people use VPNs for specific situations – working remotely, traveling internationally, safely using public WiFi, or avoiding governmental censorship. There's really nothing to lose by trying a VPN – most decent providers come with a money-back guarantee, and some offer free basic plans.
Can I be tracked while using a VPN?
VPNs are helpful for shielding your online activities from hotspot owners, network administrators, and anyone trying to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. However, while many of these services limit the type of information websites can collect about you in addition to encrypting your traffic, they will not make you completely untraceable. Here are just a few ways you can be identified despite using a VPN:
You post personally-identifiable information online.
Your VPN keeps activity and/or connection logs, which can be leaked or handed over.
You sign in somewhere with two-factor authentication.
A website logs details of your computer hardware. This isn't conclusive proof but can strongly imply you visited it since few people will have the exact same PC as you.
You register for a website that requires photo ID.
You purchase something using a credit card or bank account with your name on it.
If you're looking to browse the web anonymously, you'll have to think carefully about what and where you post, how your data might be used by the sites you visit, and how you can limit this type of collection in the first place. A VPN is a great starting point, but ultimately, they're just one part of a more mindful approach to digital privacy.
Will I get into trouble for using a VPN?
A handful of countries have restrictions on VPN usage. For instance, if you're in China, Iran, or Russia, you're only permitted to use government-approved providers. However, elsewhere in the world, there are minimal restrictions on VPN usage, provided you don't use them to commit crimes. Geo-restricted services may ask you to disable the VPN before allowing you access, but that's usually as far as the consequences go.
Are VPNs capable of stopping ISP throttling?
Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) limit customers' speeds in a bid to discourage excessive bandwidth usage. Of course, it's up to each provider to determine what constitutes “excessive”, and some are overzealous to the point of simply throttling anyone who streams or torrents semi-regularly.
ISPs are able to do this because when you're streaming, your internet traffic fits certain patterns. Depending on how the data looks, it's easy to tell if you're seeding a torrent, watching Netflix, or scrolling through YouTube.
When you connect to a VPN, however, all of your data is encrypted. This prevents your ISP from analyzing its contents without the use of more advanced technologies like Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). While this won't outright prevent your ISP from throttling your connection, it does make it less likely that your speeds will be automatically reduced.
Can I get a free VPN?
Some of the VPNs recommended in this guide offer a basic free plan, allowing you to access their security and privacy features without any cost. This is useful if you need a reliable VPN to bypass restrictions imposed by your ISP or local WiFi networks, although the free plan has limitations.
The good news is that the VPNs recommended in this guide with free plans maintain a no-logging policy for both free and paid users. In addition, the free plan includes all the essential security features, such as a kill switch, a choice of protocols, AES encryption, and DNS leak protection, ensuring that your online activities remain protected. This makes them safe to use to gain privacy from your ISP or to gain security on public WiFi.
However, it's crucial to understand that the free plans offered by these VPNs have significant limitations. They only provide access to a few server locations and do not work for accessing streaming services like Netflix. The free plans also tend to have slower speeds, which can impact data-intensive tasks like torrenting or streaming. AtlasVPN, in particular, imposes a monthly download limit of 10 GB, meaning you may need to upgrade to a paid subscription for regular VPN use.
While there are many free VPNs available online, it's important to exercise caution. Most of those services have questionable privacy policies, inadequate security, vulnerabilities in their apps and servers, and may even contain hidden spyware. Using these free VPNs poses a significant risk to your device's health and your online privacy.
For these reasons, we strongly advise against randomly selecting a free VPN from an app store. Stick to our recommendations instead, to get a reliable VPN that provides strong security for your data.
Can I access home streaming services using a VPN?
Yes, you can access your home streaming services and TV broadcasts abroad using a VPN. A VPN enables you to change your virtual location by connecting to a server in a different region or country. This allows you to access streaming platforms as if you were physically present in the location of your choice, including your home region.
A VPN can even allow you to access streaming services in work or at school, with complete privacy - by making you appear to be outside of the local network.
Here's how it works: When you connect to a VPN server, your internet traffic is routed through that server, and your IP address is temporarily replaced with the server's IP address. Streaming services often use geolocation to determine where their users are accessing content from. By using a VPN server located in the same region as your home, you can effectively bypass geographical restrictions and access home streaming services while traveling.
VPNs also provide an extra layer of security and privacy. They encrypt your internet connection, making it challenging for your ISP or other third parties to monitor your online activities. This is particularly beneficial when accessing streaming services at work because it prevents your employer from finding out!
However, it's important to be aware that not all streaming services are VPN-friendly. Some platforms actively block VPN traffic, so it's crucial to choose a VPN provider that can reliably bypass these restrictions. We have guides for specific streaming platforms, but the VPNs in this guide are all world-class services that should work with most international streams.
