Other helpful resources at BleepingComputer.com!
BleepingComputer has many useful resources to help optimize and keep your computer trouble free. These resources are outlined below.
Tech Support Forums - A discussion forum that allows you to help, receive computer help, and get to know the other members of BleepingComputer.com.
Spyware and Virus Removal Guides - Self-help guides on removing the latest computer infections.
Downloads - You can use this section to download a variety of useful programs for your computer.
Tutorials - Various tutorials on basic computer concepts, how to perform various tasks on your computer, and how to remove malware using the most popular anti-malware programs.
Startup Database - Startup programs are programs that are automatically started by Windows when the operating system starts. The problem is that many programs, viruses, hijackers, spyware, and other malware set themselves to start automatically when Windows starts. As more and more programs are started automatically, your computer's valuable resources are drained, causing your computer to operate slowly.
This database will allow you to search for programs that you find starting automatically on your computer and determine if they are considered to be malware (harmful), optional, unnecessary, or necessary to run.
Uninstall List - This database contains a list of entries that can appear in your Add or Remove Programs control panel. These programs can be
unwanted programs, and thus should be uninstalled, or for legitimate programs that you may want to leave installed. For most applications, you can remove the software using the Add or Remove Programs control panel. Malware related programs, though, may add these entries to appear legitimate and are not able to be uninstalled using this method. This database will allow you to determine if an entry in your Add or Remove Programs list should be uninstalled.
Glossary - A glossary of computer terms.
