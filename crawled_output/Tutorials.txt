Web forms
Forms are a very important part of the Web â these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, such as registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side parts of forms.
Tips for authoring fast-loading HTML pages
Optimize web pages to provide a more responsive site for visitors and reduce the load on your web server and Internet connection.
CSS tutorials
Introduction to CSS
CSS basics
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code you use to style your webpage. CSS Basics takes you through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make my text black or red? How do I make my content show up in such-and-such a place on the screen? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?
CSS Styling basics
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages â for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path toward CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
Selectors
Target HTML elements, including based on element state, with CSS.
Specificity
Understanding the browser algorithm to determine which CSS declarations get applied to an element when there are competing declarations, with a specificity quiz.
Handling conflicts
The cascade, specificity, and inheritance control how CSS is applied to HTML and how conflicts between style declarations are resolved.
CSS text Styling
Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, and italics, line and letter spacing, and drop shadows and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
Solve common CSS problems
Common questions and answers for beginners.
Intermediate CSS topics
CSS layout
At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, traditional layout methods involving float and positioning, and new fangled layout tools like flexbox.
CSS reference
Complete reference to CSS, with details on support by Firefox and other browsers.
Fluid Grids
Design layouts that fluidly resize with the browser window, while still using a typographic grid.
CSS Challenges
Flex your CSS skills, and see where you need more practice.
Advanced CSS topics

Apply rotation, skewing, scaling, and translation using CSS.
CSS transitions
CSS transitions provide a way to animate changes to CSS properties, instead of having the changes take effect instantly.
Canvas tutorial
Learn how to draw graphics using scripting using the canvas element.
JavaScript tutorials
Introduction to JavaScript
Dynamic scripting with JavaScript
In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in passing â here we'll discuss it all explicitly.
Getting started with JavaScript
What is JavaScript and how can it help you?
Codecademy
Codecademy is an easy way to learn how to code JavaScript. It's interactive and you can do it with your friends.
freeCodeCamp
freeCodeCamp teaches a variety of languages and frameworks for web development. It also has a forum, an internet radio station, and a blog.
Intermediate JavaScript topics
Introducing JavaScript objects
In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages. The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you. Here we teach object theory and syntax in detail, look at how to create your own objects, and explain what JSON data is and how to work with it.
Client-side web APIs
When writing client-side JavaScript for websites or applications, you won't go very far before you start to use APIs â interfaces for manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating system the site is running on, or even data from other websites or services. In this module, we will explore what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work.
