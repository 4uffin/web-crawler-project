JWST just found a 50‑million‑solar‑mass black hole 750 million years after the Big Bang, with no galaxy around it. That’s not supposed to happen under the standard “stars → galaxies → black holes” model.It’s pure hydrogen, so it formed before nearby stars had time to seed heavier elements. That leaves a few options: primordial black hole from the Big Bang, direct collapse of a gas cloud, or a galaxy that formed and disappeared.There are ~300 similar “little red dots” in JWST data. If most are black holes, the early universe was building them in parallel with — or before — galaxies. Either way, the neat timeline in textbooks is wrong.replycodethief 3 hours ago

If you draw conclusions from incomplete data, they tend to be wrong.
Even Prof. van Dusen and Sherlock Holmes knew that.
So if there were any difference, it would be sheer luck.replyperching_aix 33 minutes ago

Well, the black hole isnt hydrogen.
This is the gas around it.
And being pure hydrogen seems sus as there should be some helium in there according to most models.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesisNot only that, but getting stars to form using pure hydrogen is tricky.
That helium helped early stars collapse and ignite.
Not seeing any helium in an early-universe object is a big deal, suggesting some sort of error.replyandreareina 3 hours ago

N.B. This is a supermassive black hole without a galaxy, not a naked singularity. The cosmic censorship hypothesis is still safe.replyyawpitch 4 hours ago

”By reconstructing the vortex, the team directly measured the mass of the object it was orbiting: 50 million times more massive than our sun.”Is that not an indirect measurement?reply
