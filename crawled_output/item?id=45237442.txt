I didn't see any mention of angular momentum. If a gas cloud has essentially no angular momentum relative to its center of mass, it will collapse directly into a BH, no?If angular momentum exists, you get a galaxy.replypantulis 18 minutes ago

There are a bazillion ways to rotate but only one way to not rotate. I'd say that the probability of a gas cloud without angular momentum is as low as to be indistinguishable from zero.replyandrewflnr 45 minutes ago

Naive outsider here...The "single naked" titling is a bit misleading, since there are hundreds of these challenging current theory.But how often are those we do see are replicated in the so-call smear of lensing? Does this instance (QSO1) presenting 3 times create more analysis opportunities?E.g., the 7.3-hour observation that produced higher-resolution data that checked out as a vortex of hydrogen: would we expect to see the same features in all three images (modulo lensing transforms)?Reading that preprint (at [1]), it seemed they only used 1 of 3 (image A).[1] preprint: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21748replygigatexal 1 hour ago

HN discussion https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44115973 (187 points | 3 months ago | 180 comments)Note that in spite of the name it's not a "theory" that gives an clear and accurate prediction.We mix results of many theories, like electromagnetism, general relativity dopler effect, atoms ionization and spectrum, centripetal force, ... to get an accurate prediction and error estimation of how much mass a galaxy must have. Different calculations disagree, so we are forced to try to fix the theory
(MOND) or guess there is dome difficut to see mass (dark matter).The "blowtorch theory" is only a few general ideas and handwaving, without clear and precice calculations. So it's impossible to know if it explains all the current data (without dark matter) or even if the predictions digree so much with the current data that we need even more weird stuff to match it.replya3w 5 hours ago

I thought a naked singularity was a white hole, one without an event horizon. And physicists hate that idea, but expect to never find one anyway.replymarcosdumay 1 hour ago

| parent | prev | next [–]
A white hole is a completely different object, the opposite of a black hole, not a baked singularity. A white hole is an area of spacetime that no mass/energy (even light) can ever reach - versus a black hole which no mass/energy can escape.However, my understanding of what a naked singularity means is still in conflict with the article. I understood a naked singularity to be a black hole that is larger than its event horizon, such that it's possible to reach the singularity and then come back from it.replysomat 1 hour ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Being charged and or rotating changes the dynamics of where the event horizon is in interesting ways, If I understand it correctly it forms a sort of shell where you have two event horizons one inside the other. and the theory being that if enough energy(charge and/or rotational) is present the two event horizons will meet leaving your naked singularity. Nice and neat, the main problem being the absurd amount of energy required.My personal area of fascination is the time dilation around a black hole. One of those things I assume them who actually study the things(astrophysicists) take into consideration but I almost never see in the popular press. If I understand it correctly, as you fly into a black hole, nice and neat right, will see the rest of the universe quickly age and die before you reach the event horizon. If Hawking radiation is a thing you may see the black hole evaporate in front of you before you can reach it.replyJumpCrisscross 5 hours ago

No one ever shows the math anywhere. They just write that it is hard, or that it doesnt work.It became basically some sort of a pseudo religion.On a side note Lard Hadron Collider is safe from micro black holes due to Hawking radiation. Issue is, that there does not seem to be any proof for Hawking radiation. It's just a model. Probably correct, but perhaps not.
So the argument about LHC safety is flawed from the start and apparently anyone who points this out is "anti science".Sadly as I wrote science in some parts is a bizarre parody of itself, more like some cult. You cannot point out logical flaws anymore.Expecting mass downvotes for this post, with no rebuttal.Because scientists are never wrong.

You are in no position to throw accusations considering the amount of misinformation you are spreading.You could have spent two minutes to find out the actual arguments from scientists regarding the safety of the LHC, but chose not to.Here it is: https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider...> Although theory predicts that microscopic black holes decay rapidly, even hypothetical stable black holes can be shown to be harmless by studying the consequences of their production by cosmic rays.Note that the article cites critics as well as technical refutations.

If you actually would read the discourse more than a google search it was that:Cosmic ray black holes are likely to have a momentum and would probably fly out to outer space. While LHC micro black holes would stay on Earth and the potential LHC black hole could eat it.

They're addressing that:> Those produced by cosmic rays would pass harmlessly through the Earth into space, whereas those produced by the LHC could remain on Earth. However, there are much larger and denser astronomical bodies than the Earth in the Universe. Black holes produced in cosmic-ray collisions with bodies such as neutron stars and white dwarf stars would be brought to rest. The continued existence of such dense bodies, as well as the Earth, rules out the possibility of the LHC producing any dangerous black holes.replyants_everywhere 32 minutes ago

Well certainly the quality of your comments is very low. You're just repeating low-effort anti-science rhetoric.You're implying that people can't handle your brilliant understanding of logical flaws, but you've given no evidence that you even understand the basics.Since you're writing low quality conspiratorial comments, people are assuming you're just as uninformed as your comments imply. You keep trying to imply that you know more than everybody else and are just unwilling to show it.So if you have something to say to add to the conversation then now would be the time to do so.

Primordial black holes seem likely since many models predict them. They’re not a fringe idea.They are also a dark matter candidate, though this is more controversial. The ones we are seeing here would be huge ones but their masses could range the spectrum. Smaller ones would have evaporated already but there could be tons of asteroid, moon, and planetary mass ones around.At least some dark matter may be black holes the size of a hydrogen atom with the mass of an asteroid, and similar objects. These would be incredibly hard to detect. The only way would be their gravitational effects on other bodies or weak anomalous radiation bursts when they rarely encounter matter.They’re also awesome and weird. One could, for example, shoot right through the Earth. If it was small nothing might happen. Larger ones might cause seismic events or perhaps Tunguska type events due to induced fusion in the atmosphere. What was Tunguska anyway?The most exciting thing is that if small mass PBHs exist and are common enough, we could find one someday in our solar system, maybe captured as a moon or in an asteroid belt. That would be close enough to send a probe to go look at it and do experiments with it. Being able to directly examine a black hole could be the thing that lets us “finish” physics. It would let us see conditions far beyond anything any imaginable terrestrial accelerator could ever produce.replyWaxProlix 3 hours ago

I encountered a theory that 'planet x' might be such a PBH, explaining its ability to gravitationally impact post Neptunian bodies and its elusiveness. Would be incredibly cool to have something so exotic (or commonplace?) so close to home.Cool idea on Tunguska - would such an explanation make predictions that we could verify? Radioactivity or changes to carbon in stones or the rings of local trees... An interesting thought.replyapi 2 hours ago

If planet X exists and is a planetary mass PBH it could unlock the universe in many ways. We could use it as a gravitational slingshot to fire probes at significant fractions of the speed of light out for flyby surveys of other solar systems.replydwaltrip 1 hour ago

It’s hard to visualize how weird and extreme black holes are.A black hole with the mass of the Moon would be smaller than a BB but would have the mass and inertia of the Moon.

If the theory of abnormal galaxy formation hold up, then the Big Bang was spitting out both simultaneously. Maybe there’s a mathematical “tipping point” for mass where the weight of it crushes the atoms? Resulting in early black holes from abnormal matter… not from a collapse but just from mass being in close proximity. There still so much to learn…replygus_massa 7 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
> “tipping point” for mass where the weight of it crushes the atoms?If you have a material of constant density like water, bananas or rocks, then if you have a ball that is big enough you get a neutron star where all the atoms collapsed in a huge-mega-super-nuclei. (I think the surface may have some normal atoms, and the center may be even more strange.) If the ball is even more big enough you get a black hole. If you use a gas like Hydrogen that has no constant density, the calculation is similar, but more complex.IANAA, but I expect that the collapse into the black hole does not capture the 100% of the initial mass if the object is a rotating irregular blob, so in this huge cases near the big bang I expect the leftover to form something that looks like a galaxy. And the lack of leftover is what is surprising. (Again, IANAA.)Except in neutron stars and black holes, atoms are very stable. There are many conservation laws, like the number of leptons (like the electron) and barions (like the proton/neutron) that make it hard to create weird stuff. You can create weird stuff for a very short time, but almost immediately it goes back to normal stuff. As always, there may be some surprise in particle physics, but I don't remember or expect something like this.replyIAmBroom 6 hours ago

JWST just found a 50‑million‑solar‑mass black hole 750 million years after the Big Bang, with no galaxy around it. That’s not supposed to happen under the standard “stars → galaxies → black holes” model.It’s pure hydrogen, so it formed before nearby stars had time to seed heavier elements. That leaves a few options: primordial black hole from the Big Bang, direct collapse of a gas cloud, or a galaxy that formed and disappeared.There are ~300 similar “little red dots” in JWST data. If most are black holes, the early universe was building them in parallel with — or before — galaxies. Either way, the neat timeline in textbooks is wrong.replytomhow 27 minutes ago

Well, the black hole isnt hydrogen.
This is the gas around it.
And being pure hydrogen seems sus as there should be some helium in there according to most models.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesisNot only that, but getting stars to form using pure hydrogen is tricky.
That helium helped early stars collapse and ignite.

You are regurgitating almost pure grievance against people who just want to study the universe.Every researcher in every field all the time wants more data, better studies, more evidence.
That is basically what science is.This attitude about "those damn smug scientists who think they know everything" emerges from authoritarian nationalists selling resentment politics, and it has led to widespread violence against scientists in the past.
Its prevalence in Germany is one part of why the US got the bomb first, and its prevalence in the Soviet and Chinese systems is part of why were not able to keep up with us economically (until recently).This political project actively intends to defend enterprises like JWST (sometimes even after building and launching the damn thing!), and current budgets have dozens of existing projects being shut down for good.replyanalog31 6 hours ago

They're constantly challenging each other and themselves with the common goal of approximating reality with their models better and better.
