Midwest Salisbury Steak.
06/04/2019
This was delightful. Sooo good and super easy to make. Great recipe. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and added some flour and beef broth - really really really good. Next time will add some sautéed asparagus to the plate.

Eggplant Parmesan Casserole Recipe.
08/07/2018
This was fantastic as made! Next time in the sauce I’m going to add some oregano and Italian seasoning as suggested by other reviewers just to tweak to my personal taste. The recipe as written was delicious. Thank you
