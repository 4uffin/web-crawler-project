Monkey Bread from Scratch.
12/27/2020
This recipe makes a large batch of deliciousness! I like how I am able to make the bread in one day without having to keep the dough in the refrigerator over night like I had to in another recipe I used.
The only minor mistake that happened was because of a fault of my own: I used truvia brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar and that makes up most of the coating. So my monkey bread was noticeably lacking in sweetness, but nevertheless, it was great!
