Homemade Pita Bread
10/22/2020
This recipe was so easy and delicious! The directions are clear and the video was super helpful. My family absolutely loved the pita and I will definitely make this recipe often. Thank you!

Puerto Rican Breakfast Custard
01/19/2013
Glad I found this recipe - I was clearly adding too much cornstarch to mine. This recipe is really good and almost exactly what I grew up with in my Puerto Rican household. A couple of additions/substitutions that makes this Maizena (as my family calls it) exactly what I remember - about a tablespoon of butter which will add to the creaminess, and instead of 2 cups of milk, add 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of coconut milk. The light taste of the coconut milk really puts this over the top and exactly as I remember growing up! Delicious!!!
