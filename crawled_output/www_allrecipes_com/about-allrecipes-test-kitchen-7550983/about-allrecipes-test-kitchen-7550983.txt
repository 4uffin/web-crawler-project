About the Allrecipes Test Kitchen
Welcome to the home of the home cook! You may think of Allrecipes as the one-stop spot to find all your favorite recipes, but have you ever wondered how all the kitchen magic happens? Allrecipes readers (that’s you!) submit all the recipes on our site, but it doesn’t stop there.
When Allrecipes’ readers add a recipe to the site, they may choose to save it as private, only share it on their profile page, or submit it for Kitchen Approved consideration. Recipes submitted to be Kitchen Approved are evaluated by our team of recipe editors, who ensure the originality and reliability of each recipe, and edit for Allrecipes style. Only the best recipes achieve Kitchen Approved status and get published and promoted.
Meet the team who helps ensure that our popular, delicious recipes work just as you’d expect them to. We test them in kitchens equipped with only tools, appliances, and equipment that you would find in a kitchen just like your own to ensure that when you make them, they taste just as fantastic as they do during testing.
We love testing (and tasting!) your recipes, so keep them coming. Then don’t forget to come back and rate and review any of the thousands of recipes you’ll find on Allrecipes. The best ingredient in our community is you.
