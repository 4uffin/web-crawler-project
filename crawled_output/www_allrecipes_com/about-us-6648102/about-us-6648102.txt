About Us
Who We Are
Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that. Allrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night.
Most importantly, Allrecipes connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration—other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.
Our History
Founded in 1997 as CookieRecipe.com, Allrecipes changed the food world by providing the tools to share recipes and cooking tips, while celebrating the expertise of home cooks online. Since then, Allrecipes has become the world's largest community-driven food brand, providing trusted resources to more than 60 million home cooks each month.
Every day, cooks from around the world share recipes and inspire one another through recipe photos, ratings, reviews, and videos. The combination of the Allrecipes community with our team of editorial and kitchen professionals provides authority found nowhere else on the internet and has turned the brand into an indispensable resource for cooks of all skill levels.
You can connect with us and our 11M followers on social media, too. On TikTok, learn how you should store avocados or find out if air fryer coconut shrimp lives up to the hype. On Facebook and Pinterest you can browse easy weeknight meals and scour reviews of the world's best air fryers. Find photo-worthy dinner inspiration on Instagram. And on YouTube, cook along with Chef John, who serves up creative, new recipes weekly—alongside a few good laughs thanks to his well-timed puns.
If you own an Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant device, you'll find our recipes easily discoverable via Voice search.
Above all, we are:
Friendly We love trading ideas and hanging out with fellow home cooks. Supportive Struggling with dinner inspo? We’re here to help!Creative Cooking is an art. We like to experiment and express ourselves.Approachable We don't judge—all cooking levels and recipes are welcome. Down-to-Earth We love good food, period. It doesn’t need to be fussy to be great.Fun Like you, we enjoy friends, family, cooking, and having a good laugh.
Allrecipes Magazine
The food industry's first large-scale digital-to-print brand extension, Allrecipes magazine launched in 2013. Now published six times a year, it reaches an audience of nearly 9 million. The magazine serves up a seasonal slice of recipes and real-cook wisdom from Allrecipes.com—along with the best of what's new from the greater food and cooking community (emerging trends, entertaining ideas, new products, and more). We aim for a mix of approachable inspiration and down-to-earth service in every issue.
A majority of the recipes in Allrecipes magazine start with creations shared by home cooks on Allrecipes.com. All are tested, tasted, refined, edited, and professionally photographed before they appear in the magazine. Our editors and contributors also research and write about entertaining, diverse cuisines, Allrecipes Allstars and other fascinating cooks, kitchen decor and organization, cooking gadgets and gear, culinary travel, health, special diets, nutrition, parenting, and pets. We incorporate the best advice from editors, testers, and the cooking community to make good recipes better, great recipes easier, and every day a little more delicious. Sign up for a subscription now.
The Allrecipes Community
The heart of Allrecipes is our community of home cooks who share their beloved family recipes, create new recipes, and photograph, rate, and review each other's recipes. Each week, more than 15 million registered members add more than 2,000 recipe ratings, 800 new recipe photos, and almost 200 new recipes to the site. And every minute of every day, 27 people are saving recipes they love or want to try later.
Community Guidelines
We moderate every review and photograph added to a recipe. When leaving reviews, we ask that you remember that a fellow Allrecipes community member has shared their recipe with you. Constructive feedback is always welcome, but rude, mean, disrespectful, or spammy comments are not welcome and will not be approved.
The Allrecipes Allstars
Social media influencers, registered dietitians, grillmasters, and more seasoned home cooks make up our enthusiastic squad of 100+ brand ambassadors. This diverse, food-loving crew spans the U.S. geographically and represents many different cultures, ethnicities, and family makeups. Since 2011, the Allrecipes Allstars have created tens of thousands of original recipes, photos, and reviews plus shared their cooking expertise via flat and video content on our website, social media, plus more marketing channels.

Recipe Approval and Testing
Kitchen-Approved Recipes
Since Allrecipes' inception in 1997, we have always been about your recipes: by home cooks, for home cooks. All recipes submitted by Allrecipes' members that are published on the site have been evaluated by our team of recipe editors, who ensure the originality and reliability of each recipe, and edit for clarity and Allrecipes style. Each recipe undergoes a series of editorial reviews for:
Duplication: Editors verify that the recipe doesn't duplicate another that has already been published elsewhere.
Completion: The ingredient list is evaluated to be sure it is complete, that measurements are correct, and that ingredients are properly ordered and grouped according to their use.
Accuracy: Serving sizes and yields are checked for accuracy and to be sure that recipes reflect USDA dietary recommendations.
Replication: Recipes are reviewed and edited to ensure they are replicable when following the instructions. Editors assess the techniques, equipment, and appliances used in the recipes, and explain any intermediate or advanced techniques with simple language and visuals.
Health claims: Editors evaluate the use of any health or nutrition claims—such as healthy, low-carb, low-fat, or paleo—based on guidelines from the dieticians at our sister brand, Eating Well.
Once recipes are thoroughly evaluated and edited, they are not only reliable but also compatible with our nutrition analysis, scaling, shopping list, and other recipe tools. Only the best recipes achieve Kitchen Approved status and get published and promoted.
After publication, the Allrecipes audience can add their own photos, ratings, and reviews to recipes. In the reviews, they share tips for making recipes even better and adjusting them to personal tastes or diets.
Allrecipes Magazine Recipe Testing
Recipes selected for publication in Allrecipes magazine get further scrutiny and testing. Magazine recipes are tested one to four times in our test kitchens in Des Moines, Iowa, and Birmingham, Alabama.
Trained test kitchen professionals prepare every recipe and then taste and evaluate it with recipe and story editors, confirming and clarifying all key components (including ingredient types and amounts, cooking procedures and times and temperatures, yields), and incorporating changes as needed to improve flavor, ease, and visual appeal.
For recipes that have a long trail of user commentary, editors and testers also evaluate and incorporate suggestions from the community. Fully tested and edited recipes are then prepared by a food stylist for professional photography and reviewed again by a registered dietitian for nutrition and health-related tags used in the magazine (Healthy Pick, Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free).
Product Reviews
Our product reviews are independent and based on research and product testing — if you visit links within our content, we may receive commissions from your purchases, but we never receive any compensation or consideration for the content of our recommendations. Learn more about our review process.
Editorial Guidelines
At Allrecipes, we take great pride in the quality of our content. Our writers, photographers, and editors create original, accurate, and engaging content that reflects the interests and concerns of home cooks, and our recipe editors verify all user submissions before publication.
Original illustrations, graphics, images, and videos are created by internal teams who collaborate with experts in their fields to produce assets that represent diverse voices, perspectives, and contexts. Photos and videos are not edited in any way that may cause them to be false or misleading.
We correct any factual errors in a transparent manner and strive to make it easy for our readers to bring errors to our attention.
Read our full integrity promise including our policies on accuracy and corrections, fact checking independence and impartiality, and originality here.
At Allrecipes, we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT.
Our Values
Allrecipes believes everyone and every voice deserves a seat at the table. We want all home cooks to find dishes that represent them and honor their heritage, and we strive to cultivate a community reflective of our readers’ varied backgrounds. That goes for our team, too! We are diligent about working with writers, editors, photographers, and recipe developers with expertise in all types of cuisines. Our goal is to make room for everyone at the table (so long as they share the secrets to grandma’s best recipes).
