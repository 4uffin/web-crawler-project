Critics Consensus
Cozy as an undemanding beach reach and just as slight, this starry murder mystery leverages its terrific troupe of actors to nostalgic effect.

There is some shock value, but the film goes too far in evading the truth; it nearly forgets to establish an emotional tether between the audience and its suspects.

Sometimes all you need is a nice, safe, and utterly pleasant piece of cinematic diversion that doesn’t insult your intelligence and is made with sturdy, workmanlike competence.

What could go wrong? Nothing. That doesn’t make (it) a particularly good film. But even in a middling movie, when absolutely everybody in a ridiculously talented company is clicking on all eight cylinders, you’d have to be criminally grouchy to nitpick.
Rated: 3/5

Despite the dazzling stars in good form and the industry heft behind the production, it's only
a moderately entertaining caper

The Thursday Murder Club may not redefine the genre or be an Agatha Christie-level masterpiece, but it succeeds on its own terms. It is certainly more engaging than many of the bland, forgettable mysteries currently flooding streaming platforms.

The irony in all this tosh screams at Spinal Tap 11/10 levels. Premise: elderly people aren't as doddery, incompetent or stupid as presented in common cliches. Execution: let's explain who the characters are, what they used to do, what their names are, and what the plot is, which is presented like steps up a garden path for the elderly audience who (writer, director, producer obviously thought) wouldn't understand anything complicated. Awful, and vaguely insulting.

There isn't much depth here and it's exactly what you expect out of a murder mystery movie. There are some misdirects and some twists, a lot of unrealistic parts of an investigation, and a giant explanation at the end to tell us who dun it. But, it was a very fun and enjoyable movie. The cast was remarkable and they all played their parts very well.

As a fan of the TMC books I was looking forward to watching this, albeit with some trepidation knowing that Pierce Brosnan had, ludicrously, been cast at Ron.
Thirty minutes in and my disdain for this awful piece of film making was off the scale. What on earth were Spielberg and Columbus thinking? Or Osman for that matter? I know it's not possible for a two hour film to capture all the subtleties of a book on which it's based but this not only failed to get anywhere near the book, it completely reversed many of its better points.
A stand out disappointment for me was David Tennant's carpet chewing performance. What were you thinking David? Surely you don't need the money?
.
I could go on.
Particularly about the gratuitous ⁵llamas.
But I'll spare you that.

Had fun watching the film with my family. Could have had a little more depth in some areas but still enjoyed watching. Would watch again.

Shame it wasn't a 6 part series.
This could have been a great series, preferably on the BBC. It was made for an international audience and Coopers Chase felt like Hogwarts; it lost much of its soul, humour and charm as a result of it being turned into an American's (mis)understanding of England.
I'm sure other reviews will have commented on the utterly perplexing casting of Pierce Brosnan as an East End, West Ham supporting Trade Union man (someone like Ray Winstone is the type we're looking for here). A shame as the other casting was mostly quite good (Bogdan notwisthstanding).
As someone who has loved the books, it was a huge let down and felt like a waste of a mostly fine cast and a big wedge of cash.
