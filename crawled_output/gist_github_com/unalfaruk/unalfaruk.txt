% Define parameters
len = 100000; % Length of original binary data stream
N1 = 3; % First repetition factor; should be odd to avoid tie
N2 = 5; % Second repetition factor; should be odd to avoid tie
N3 = 7; % Third repetition factor; should be odd to avoid tie

bin_str = round(rand(1,len));
% Employ repetition code with repetition factors N1, N2, N3
