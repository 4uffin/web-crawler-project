Apple Music Profile Effect
Raw
Scratchpad.swift
import SwiftUI
struct AppleMusicProfile: View {
let profileImage: Image
let name: String
let username: String
var body: some View {
ZStack {
// (1) Blurred profile image for background
profileImage
.resizable()
.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
.blur(radius: 32)
// (2) Overlayed content
VStack {
// (2a) clipped profile image for display
profileImage
.resizable()
.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
.frame(width: 150, height: 150)
.clipShape(Circle())
.shadow(radius: 3)
// (2b) Text content
Text(name)
.font(.title.bold())
.blendMode(.destinationOut)
// (2c) Blend mode .destinationOut allows us to cut out the text from the background instead of overlaying it
Text("@\(username)")
.font(.callout)
.foregroundStyle(.fill)
// (2d) Another approach is to simply use foregroundStyle vibrancy
// This has the advantage of providing better contrast if a profile
// image is all white for example
}
.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .center)
.background(.regularMaterial) // (3) Material background will go between blurred image and content layers
.compositingGroup()
// (4) Compositing group + the blend mode on the text allows
// to cut the text out of the material
// This is only necessary if you use the approach from (2c) and not (2d)
// for your text
}
}
