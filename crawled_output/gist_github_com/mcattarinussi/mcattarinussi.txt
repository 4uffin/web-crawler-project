/ tabaccomapp-gpx-fix.js
Created
January 19, 2022 16:26
/*
The gpx dowloaded from the activity page on tabaccomapp website does not include <time> elements inside the <trkpt>,
this prevents to upload a gpx downloaded from tabaccomapp to Strava.
This script uses the tabaccomapp json api to construct a gpx containing time elements.
Install dependencies: npm i axios ramda xml2js
Usage: node index.js <TABACCOMAPP-ACTIVITY-URL> <ACTIVITY-START-DATE-ISO> > output.gpx
Example: node index.js https://tabaccomapp-community.it/en/percorso/123-xxx-yyy 2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z > 123-xxx-yyy.gpx
