# debianize
# My notes of migrating a Ubuntu system to Debian, incrementally and (mostly) live.
# The way this works is:
# 1. Bootstrap a Debian install into /debian.
# 2. Boot that as a container with systemd-nspawn.
# 3. Set up kernel, bootloader and sshd inside the container.
# 4. Boot into recovery, move all root-level folders under /ubuntu and move
#
everything under /debian to the root folder, then reboot.
#
(This should be the only downtime.)
# 5. Run /ubuntu as a container, gradually move one service after another out

// This is a patch for the macOS version of Graveyard Keeper (might work for arbitrary apps, but zero guarantees).
// The game completely fails to support fullscreen, yet runs beautifully with it if you force it to.
// So this patch simply brings back the functionality of the little green button in the window's upper left corner.
// I have sadly not found a way to automatically inject this by means of a Steam interface - if you do, please let me know!
// For the rest, you should probably be an advanced user to use this. No support or warranty.
// Compile and inject with:
// clang -shared -o FullScreen.dylib FullScreen.m -Wall -O3 -framework AppKit
// DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/path/to/FullScreen.dylib /path/to/Graveyard\ Keeper

Thoughts on jailbreak detection
The controversy of jailbreak detection has been brought up multiple times in my Twitter feed, so in order to not have to repeat myself, I'll write my thoughts down here.
One day I'll hopefully get round to set up a realistic blog and then I'll move this there, but for now I'll just dump it here on GitHub.
Motivation
Hi. I'm Siguza, and among other things I write exploits for a hobby and help make jailbreaks. One of the reasons I do that is because I believe we should have the ability to run whatever we want on our iDevices, just as we do with laptops and desktop computers. Now, a lot of app developers however seem to despise jailbreaks, and try to make their apps refuse service on jailbroken devices. I think that firstly sucks big time, and secondly always misses the point. From what I gathered, the two arguments for using jailbreak detection seem to be:

Analysing some PayPal phishing
Not long ago I tweeted about some PayPal phishing mails I got, which appeared to use hacked websites for their cause, and of which all traces were gone 24h after my initial recon.
Well, I got another such mail:
