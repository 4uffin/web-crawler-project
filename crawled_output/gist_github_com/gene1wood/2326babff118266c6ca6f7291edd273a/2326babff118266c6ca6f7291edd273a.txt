How to find the link to HP Drivers and Support for retired products
Raw
how-to-find-HP-retired-product-support-page.md
If you go to the HP support site
https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/desktops
And enter the serial number of your retired HP device, it will respond with an error message saying that your product is
retired and that they don't provide drivers and manuals any more.
HP policy for products no longer supported
HP Support may vary by product. Once a product is retired, the official HP support content (troubleshooting articles, user guides, how-to videos, etc.) for that product is removed from the HP web site. Additional support content may still be available via the HP Forums or from third-party web sites; however, HP takes no responsibility for content authored by third-parties.
Here's the trick to bypass this and get to the page containing the drivers and manuals.
Determine the productNameOid of your HP product
In your browser, open your development tools so you can see all of the network calls made by the web page.
Enter your products serial number in the search bar and hit enter.
The network calls listed in the developer tools will show a few different calls. One of those calls will be an HTTP POST to this URL
https://support.hp.com/wcc-services/pdp/us-en/offers?pageId=retiredproductmodal&authState=anonymous&template=retiredproductmodal
The request data being POSTed will contain a JSON blob that looks like this
{
"requestId": "1729368621663ksztEa5",
"products":
[
{
"modelNumber": "WW636AA",
"serialNumber": "4CE0200552",
"productSeriesOid": "4162263",
"productNameOid": "4224849",
"warranty":
{}
}
]
}
Somehow, the HP website has some ability to convert a serial number into a "productNameOid" which is the internal ID number used
for that product. We'll need this later.
Find a support page and swap in the productNameOid
I then went to Google and searched for the general class of product (in my case "hp pavilion 6000 desktop drivers site:support.hp.com") which brought up a search
result on the HP support site for a product that wasn't the exact one I was looking for (in my case "HP Pavilion p6340f Desktop").
I navigated to that support page
https://support.hp.com/ph-en/drivers/hp-pavilion-p6000-desktop-pc-series/model/4120191
then took the "productNameOid" I'd gotten from the JSON blob above and replaced the last number in the URL with that ID number
This changed the URL to
https://support.hp.com/ph-en/drivers/hp-pavilion-p6000-desktop-pc-series/model/4224849
Which is the support page for the specific model and serial number of my product
