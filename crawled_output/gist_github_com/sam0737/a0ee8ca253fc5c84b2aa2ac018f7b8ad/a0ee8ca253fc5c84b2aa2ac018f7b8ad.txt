FYI, When I used this I had to disable Browser Source Hardware Acceleration in OBS Studio v22.0.2 64bit - Settings/Advanced/Sources, otherwise it didn't appear on screen. Thanks for this wonderful and easy solution!

Hi! I've been trying to do a local version of the this saved as a HTML file which you modify in an editor then load up as a local file in Browser source. I've forked this with the changes I've made, but for some reason border-radius isn't working. Any ideas?

I ended up pasting the URL from SJP176 plut the old text formatting.
Otherwise I get the YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-04:00 format.

Lol, before noticing these comments, I found a partial workaround: using OBS "browser" plugin "custom CSS" field to set the font size and color (e.g. body { background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); margin: 0px 5px; overflow: hidden; font-size: 50px; color: lightgray }), although I was not able to change the time format that way (so it was still YYYY-MM-DD etc.).
Learning that just replacing "cdn.rawgit.com" with "gistcdn.githack.com" in the original URLs fixed them has been a relief! Thank you @SJP176 !
Wondering if something would be broken (as it looks like the URLs may refer to specific github commits?) in case @sam0737 updates the instruction page with the new URLs... [UPDATE: Probably not... the instructions are just in a comment. So, unless github prevents from editing older posts, he should be able to update the instructions without breaking anything at all!]

Rawgit URL is dead now, it's no longer accessible, so you have to use a different URL to get the clock.

I want it to display fractional seconds, but, I can't get it to work. Is there any way to have an refresh rate or auto-update function?

You should use moment with locales instead:
<script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.18.1/moment-with-locales.min.js'></script>
Then you can use your language on the timestamps:
moment.locale('de');
m = moment('2025-10-07 22:00:10');
output.innerText = m.format(urlParams["format"] || 'dd. DD MMM YYYY | HH:mm:ss');
It will print:
Di. 07. Okt. 2025 | 22:00:10
To use the locales with this code, just add:
moment.locale('de');
output.innerText = moment().format(urlParams["format"] || '... your_format ...');
For example:
output.innerText = moment().format(urlParams["format"] || 'dd. DD MMM YYYY | HH:mm:ss');
It is nice to always have international code, so, you can adapt it to your country.
