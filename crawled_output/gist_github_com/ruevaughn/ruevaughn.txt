Q: Cross-Domain Javascript Source FIle Inclusion - why is this a potential websecurity risk exactly?
A: Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion refers to the practice of including JavaScript files from a different domain into a web page. This can pose several web security risks:
Loss of Control: By including JavaScript from an external domain, you lose control over the content. If the external domain is compromised, the attacker can modify the JavaScript code to include malicious behavior.

Data Leakage: Information can be leaked to third parties through the included scripts, potentially exposing sensitive user data.
Dependency on External Availability: Your site's functionality might becom
