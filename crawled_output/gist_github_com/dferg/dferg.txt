Introduction
Sometimes you may want to use a DNS server for specific domain requests and another DNS server for all other requests. This is helpful, for instance, when connected to a VPN. For hosts behind that VPN you want to use the VPN's DNS server but all other hosts you want to use Google's public DNS. This is called "DNS splitting."
Here, we run dnsmasq as a background service on macOS. The dnsmasq configuration described below implements DNS splitting.
Install
brew install dnsmasq

HOWTO: Install L2TP/IPsec Server on TomatoUSB
Introduction
This howto describes setting up a LT2P over IPsec VPN server on your router with TomatoUSB firmware. This should allow you to connect using the built-in client to your Mac, iPhone or Android device. (Not sure about Windows.)
At the end of this tutorial, you should have a L2TP/IPsec VPN server that starts automatically on boot. Mac/iPhone/Android devices can connect with their native client and will be assigned an IP address within your LAN subnet. They should be able to talk to other devices on your LAN and should be able to contact hosts on the Internet NAT'd behind your WAN IP address.
Requirements
Router running Shibby's fork of TomatoUSB
entware installed to a USB stick mounted at /opt (howto)
