Tips for installing kali 2020.4
https://techlog360.com/how-to-dual-boot-kali-linux-v2-0-with-windows-10/
1. Unable to mount ... (somethings like cdrom or ...)
https://superuser.com/questions/962926/cant-install-kali-linux-from-usb-fails-to-find-cd-rom-drive
If step "select and install software" failed, just jump to next step.
2. You must have network connection to install cuz some package is missing. If Kali instalation can not detect driver for wifi then plug a ethernet cable

System Performance
2. System Performance: Methodologies
2.1 Terminology
IOPS: Input/output operations per second is a measure of the rate of data transfer operations. For disk I/O, IOPS refers to reads and writes per second.
Throughput: The rate of work performed. Especially in communications, the term is used to refer to the data rate (bytes per second or bits per second). In some contexts (e.g., databases) throughput can refer to the operation rate (operations per second or transactions per second).
Response time: The time for an operation to complete. This includes any time spent waiting and time spent being serviced (service time), including the time to transfer the result.
latency: A measure of time an operation waiting to be serviced. In some contexts, it can refers to the entire time for an operation, equivalent to response time.
Utilization: với các resource cung cấp theo kiểu request, đây là cách đo lường cho mức độ resource đc sử dụng (how busy a resource is), dựa trên thời gian sử
