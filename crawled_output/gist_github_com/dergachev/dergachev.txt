¬´J‚Äôavais 14 ans quand Internet est apparu, 18 lorsqu‚Äôil a √©clat√© au grand jour, 22 lorsqu‚Äôil a atteint sa maturit√©. J‚Äôai suivi et particip√© ‚Äî en tant que programmeur ‚Äî √† toutes les √©tapes du d√©veloppement de cet outil qui semble √™tre devenu un √™tre √† part enti√®re dont beaucoup ne peuvent plus se passer. Mais, en 2005, alors que je gagnais confortablement ma vie et g√©rais une communaut√© virtuelle de 8 000 membres, j‚Äôai tout quitt√©.
La vie virtuelle n‚Äôest pas ce qu‚Äôelle para√Æt √™tre quand on la d√©couvre. Elle est comme une jolie fille qui se transforme en araign√©e et tisse une toile d‚Äôune telle densit√© qu‚Äôon en vient √† oublier qu‚Äôil y avait quelque chose au-dehors. Pour elle, j‚Äôai mis ma vie r√©elle entre parenth√®ses pendant pr√®s de dix ans et cela a eu des cons√©quences dont je ne mesure la port√©e qu‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui. Je sais que je ne remettrai jamais mon c≈ìur dans ce monde-l√†, et je n‚Äôai pas besoin de justifier ce qui m‚Äôest apparu comme un simple choix entre la Vie et la Mort. Toutefois, deux ans plus tard, j‚Äôai d√©c

Here's some research on racks that I did, that you can share with Andre:
Type of Racks
As I mentioned, the most important thing is to get a rack which will easily let you lock the bike frame to it, not just the wheel.
Here's a handy guide explaining different considerations: https://s3.amazonaws.com/BikeWalkNC/Docs/NCBikeSummit2013/Presentations/Bicycle+Parking.pdf
Design Option 1
The cheapest / most common option is a sheffield rack (aka staple rack).

Looking for gems buried in my old gists
Looking for gems buried in my old gists
Inspired to do some spring cleaning today, I reviewed my archived gists to see if there's anything noteworthy. I was pleasantly surprised to find a few nuggets buried amongst random error logs and git diffs.
Some of them are interesting technical guides that took hours to write, and it's a shame that they've rotted away in obscurity. Several others were picked up by google, and turns out they even got a few comments and a bunch of stars.
How to convert MOV to GIF on OSX
Forward your clipboard via SSH reverse tunnels
How to use setuid to install a root backdoor.

Job description
Are you curious if we use Marketo? SFDC? Infer? InsightSquared? Are you curious what percent of our leads are organic vs. paid? Do you get a kick out of solving the case of Encyclopedia Brown vs. the missing MQLs? Do you want to have a meaningful role at the table instead of a supporting one? Yup, we are definitely looking for you!
At UserVoice we create a product management platform which helps companies listen to their customers, intelligently prioritize their product roadmap, and provide an excellent customer experience. We're building a marketing team focused on delivering top-line revenue growth through leveraged methods like inbound marketing and focused SEM. Now, we need someone to help us turn our hacked-together backend into a F1 machine that will help everyone set new land speed records.
We're looking for a very special individual who has a demonstrated ability to build an effective marketing technology stack and the supporting analytics engine. We're not talking about that "b
