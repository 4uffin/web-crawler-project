Install Gestures App on Zorin OS (or most Ubuntu-based distributions)

Using jumpcutter to trim silence from videos
jumpcutter - Remove silence from videos
Introduction
One of the most time consuming aspects of editing videos for me is removing silence. I tend to create an outline for a video which I refer to as I record but inevitably have to think as I go which leads to pauses. It can dramatically increase the length of a video and I try to keep mine as short as I can.
I capture an average of two to three times the length of a finished video in raw footage that I then need to edit down. The editing process can take many hours depending on the amount of footage. Anything I can do to reduce that time is huge, not only in time saved but in reducing fatigue and overall making the process much less taxing and enjoyable (this is supposed to be fun!).

Cinnamon 4 Desktop on Ubuntu 19.04 Minimal Install
Cinnamon 4 Desktop on Ubuntu 19.04 Minimal Install
Objective
Install the Cinnamon 4 desktop environment on a minimal install of Ubuntu 19.04. It is possible (and easier) to install Cinnamon without this process but you end up with many GNOME-specific packages and applications you may not want.
Step 1 - Download Ubuntu Network Installer

The Desktop
Positive
It's GNOME with the missing pieces added back (system tray, launcher, desktop icons).
This version of GNOME does seem much snappier with smoother animations.
The Unity layout is familiar, usable and configurable enough that's is easy to jump in and start using it without a ton of customization.

General Impressions
Maybe a rare example of a hybrid desktop with the inclusion of GTK apps that blend well with the overall look and feel.
