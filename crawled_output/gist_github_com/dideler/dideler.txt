Code katas - small toy problems to practice technique
# At a building there are two queues of people: entering and leaving.
# Only one person can go through the turnstile at a time.
# A person leaving and a person entering can approach the turnstile at the same time.
# Given two integer arrays of times and directions of people, figure out who goes when.
#
# If no conflict at time t, first come first served
# Otherwise,
#
if gate was not used in previous second,
out has priority
#
if gate was used in previous second to go out, out has priority
#
if gate was used in previous second to go in,
in has priority
