What switch enables installation in portable mode?
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable
Maybe something like (untested)
# Define the URL for the VSCode portable zip file
$zipUrl = "https://update.code.visualstudio.com/latest/win32-x64-archive/stable"
# Define the path to save the zip file and the installation directory
$zipPath = "$env:TEMP\vscode_portable.zip"
$installDir = "C:\VSCodePortable"
# Download the VSCode portable zip file
Write-Output "Downloading Visual Studio Code portable..."
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $zipUrl -OutFile $zipPath
# Create the installation directory if it doesn't exist
if (-not (Test-Path $installDir)) {
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $installDir
}
# Extract the zip file to the installation directory
Write-Output "Extracting Visual Studio Code portable..."
Expand-Archive -Path $zipPath -DestinationPath $installDir -Force
# Create the data folder to enable portable mode
$dataDir = "$installDir\data"
if (-not (Test-Path $dataDir)) {
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dataDir
}
# Uncomment to Clean up the zip file
# Remove-Item -Path $zipPath -Force
