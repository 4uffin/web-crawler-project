Docker Build & Cache
1. Build Caching Basics
Docker caches layers based on commands in the Dockerfile.
To take advantage of caching:
Copy dependency files (pyproject.toml, uv.lock, etc.) before source code.
Run dependency installation (uv sync, pip install) before copying the app code.
Cache is reused if the files/commands in a layer haven't changed.
