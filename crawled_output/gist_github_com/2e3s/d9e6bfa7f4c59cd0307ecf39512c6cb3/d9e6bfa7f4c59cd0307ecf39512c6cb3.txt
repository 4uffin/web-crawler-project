Pomodoro in KDE
Raw
README.md
I use a great widget focus-plasmoid
(KDE store) for Pomodoro-driven work on KDE. There are no prominent alternatives so far.
The work happens on a different virtual desktop (or activity).
When focus starts, the virtual desktop with working applications gets switched on.
When focus ends, a message box asks for a short description of what is done in the past period
(when it is still in the context), then a daily report is shown as a popup and the virtual desktop gets changed.
A few seconds of the sleep time is to avoid confusion and prepare to get switched after a dong sound.
The report gets also saved in a folder along the script for every day and can be reviewed later.
The following scripts for "Start focus" and "End focus" settings provide the additional functionality.

end.sh
#!/bin/bash
sleep 3
DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
cd $DIR
month=$(date '+%Y-%m')
day=$(date '+%d')
logfile=logs/$month/$day.txt
mkdir -p logs/$month
if [ -f "$logfile" ]; then
lines=`wc -l $logfile | cut -f1 -d' '`
else
lines=0
fi
lines=$((lines+1))
report=$(kdialog --title "Pomodoro report" --inputbox "What have you done in this focus?")
if [ ! -z "$report" ]
then
echo "$lines) $report" >> $logfile
fi

I had some script like this years ago for gnome - using zenity. I was searching for some time for something simple like this. Nice combination, thank you.
Sorry, something went wrong.
Uh oh!
