Pomodoro in KDE
I use a great widget focus-plasmoid
(KDE store) for Pomodoro-driven work on KDE. There are no prominent alternatives so far.
The work happens on a different virtual desktop (or activity).
When focus starts, the virtual desktop with working applications gets switched on.
When focus ends, a message box asks for a short description of what is done in the past period
(when it is still in the context), then a daily report is shown as a popup and the virtual desktop gets changed.
A few seconds of the sleep time is to avoid confusion and prepare to get switched after a dong sound.
The report gets also saved in a folder along the script for every day and can be reviewed later.
