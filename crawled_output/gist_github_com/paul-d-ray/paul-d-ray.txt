Nushell Get Month Number and Month Name
Month Number and Month Name
I had a need to get the month number and month name of the odd number moonths.
This code can be changed to get the even months by changing the mod statment (1 to 0).
To get all months, comment out the mod statement.

One program to oversee Windows Package mangers
In Windows, I have programs that have the updates managed a number of ways.
I don't like to have programs auto update.
I like to wait a few days (weeks) to update a program to see if
there are any issues caused by the update.
Sometimes a program update will:
remove features / functions that I like to use.
cause issues with other programs.
cause system issues (even a system crash).
I also have auto updates turned off in Windows. I run the updates manually.

Calculators (OpalCalc, SpeedCrunch, Qalculate)
For this last 15 years I have always had a calculator open and running in my Windows PC.
I used the calculate to quicky calculate percentages, multiply rates.
I also use the calculatr for just a quick note (I know not really the purpose for a calculator).
SpeedCrunch
SpeedCrunch
I used this after I found out about it around 2007.
At the time, I wished it had a dark mode, and in 2014 (version 0.11) it did have dark mode.

File Size Accumulated
This was from Nushell's Discord channel, on 2025/08/10, in the help chat.
@Bahex @timtimtim
I have some file sizes in a table like this [ {size: 12B} {size: 34B} {size: 56B} ].
How can I add a column to this table of the "accumulated" size as we iterate through
the records? In this instance, it'd be additional fields (say accumulated) with values
[ {accumulated: 12B} {accumulated: 46B} {accumulated: 102B} ], where 46 = 12 + 34,
and 102 = 12 + 34 + 56. I'm trying to do this without a global counter variable
if possible. (If the only reasonable solution is a counter variable, then I'd know how to do that)

Nushell LS with a path vs LS without a Path
LS and Glob patterns
In Nushell
on Windows, the LS command's behavior differs due to how it handles hidden system directories like "System Volume Information".
Without a path (ls): Uses a wildcard pattern (*) with glob matching, which filters out "System Volume Information" because it has the
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN
attribute, per Windows-specific hidden file detection logic.
With a path (ls C:): Directly reads directory contents, bypassing glob filtering, so "System Volume Information" is shown if accessible.
