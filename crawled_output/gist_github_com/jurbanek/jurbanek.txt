Hyper-V Network Fix
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Apply a defined IP network to the Hyper-V Default Switch
.DESCRIPTION
Apply a defined IP network to the Hyper-V Default Switch
After host restart, the Hyper-V Default Switch IP network changes to a non-deterministic value. The Default Switch
provides DHCP and NAT services to allow VM's to communicate to the outside and Internet. The changing IP network
presents challenges for VM's with static IP addresses on the Default Switch.

CONCEPT CODE ONLY to reset Palo Alto Networks Windows User-ID Agent service account credentials
<#
CONCEPT CODE ONLY to reset Palo Alto Networks Windows User-ID Agent service account credentials
Modifies the service's "log on" credentials
The "new credentials" can be obtained via a password vault API, other automation, or simple
Get-Credential. This concept uses Get-Credential for concept ease
Assume running locally on Windows server running the Windows User-ID Agent. Can be adapted to run
remotely (consider replacing Get-WmiObject with Get-CimInstance and using the -ComputerName parameter)
Additional error handing and logic is advisable for production use cases
