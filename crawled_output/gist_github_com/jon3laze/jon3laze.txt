This is a collection of Federal Standard Colors.
// Color system
//
// This is a collection of Federal Standard Colors
// Information retrieved from https://www.e-paint.co.uk/Federal_standard_595_colour_chart.asp
//
// The L* a* b* (together with the corresponding HLC, RGB and CYMK) values are based on the average of various measurements using various spectrophotometers using D65 light with a standard observer according to CIE 1964 which may be updated or modified by any other relevant available information.
// They are not necessarily the L* a* b* figures intended by any standard and should therefore only be used as a guide.
// The colours depicted are also for guidance only. The displayed colour will depend on your monitor, browser and angle of the screen and pearl or metallic colours cannot be shown adequately. The finished colour, therefore, may not be as shown here.
// The sRGS conversion system used is IEC 61966:2-1 D50 adapted which may differ from other conversions.
