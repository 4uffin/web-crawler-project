mcp.agent_spawn({ type: "analyst", capabilities: ["performance", "optimization"] }),
mcp.agent_spawn({ type: "optimizer", capabilities: ["resource_management", "scaling"] })
]);
Step 3: Configure Neural Processing
// 4. Initialize Neural Cluster

üîß Optimization Recommendations
Immediate Optimizations (Priority: High)
1. Sandbox Lifecycle Management
Issue: E2B sandboxes completing lifecycle during extended operations
Solution:
// Implement sandbox persistence and recreation
const maintainSandbox = async (sandboxId) => {
const status = await mcp.sandbox_status({ sandbox_id: sandboxId });
if (status.status !== 'running') {
return await mcp.sandbox_create({
template: status.template,
name: `${status.name}_renewed`,
env_vars: status.env_vars
});
}
return sandboxId;
};
2. Memory Optimization
Issue: 38.6% memory growth over extended duration
Solution:
// Implement memory cleanup routines
const optimizeMemory = async () => {
if (global.gc) {
global.gc();
}
// Clear unused neural network weights
await mcp.neural_cluster_optimize({
cluster_id: clusterId,
optimization: "memory_cleanup"
});
};
3. Real-Time Stream Optimization
Issue: Potential stream backlog during high load
Solution:
// Implement stream batching and buffering
const optimizeStreaming = {
batch_size: 100,
buffer_timeout: 1000,
max_buffer_size: 10000,
compression: true
};
Medium-Term Optimizations (Priority: Medium)
1. Neural Network Efficiency
Implement model pruning for reduced memory usage
Add quantization for faster inference
Optimize WASM compilation for specific architectures
2. Workflow Orchestration
Add workflow dependency optimization
Implement parallel execution where possible
Add workflow caching for repeated operations
3. Storage Optimization
Implement data compression
Add intelligent caching layers

Long-Term Optimizations (Priority: Low)
1. Advanced AI Features
Implement self-optimizing neural networks
Add predictive scaling based on usage patterns
Develop autonomous error recovery
2. Infrastructure Scaling
