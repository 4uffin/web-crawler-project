How to add Ctrl + Alt + T keyboard shortcut similar to Linux to open Terminal on MacOS (⌃ + ⌘ + T 2025 how-to guide)
On macOS there is no global “open Terminal” shortcut out of the box.
Option (⌥)+⌘+T is already used in Finder to show/hide the toolbar.
Control (⌃)+⌘+T isn’t assigned system-wide (only in some apps for context-specific commands), so it’s free to grab for a global hot-key.
Below is a Linux-style setup using Automator + System Settings so that ⌃+⌘+T will launch Terminal no matter which app you’re in.
1. Create a “Quick Action” in Automator
Open Automator (in /Applications or via Spotlight).
Choose New Document, then select Quick Action (aka “Service”), click Choose.
At the top of the workflow area set:
Workflow receives: no input
in: any application
In the left Library pane, search for Run Shell Script, then drag it into the workflow.
In the shell-script box:
Shell: /bin/zsh (or /bin/bash—whichever you use)
Default is /bin/zsh, of course
Script:
open -a Terminal
(You can also use open -a "iTerm" if you prefer iTerm.)
Save the Quick Action (⌘+S) with the name:
Open Terminal
2. Assign ⌃+⌘+T as the Global Shortcut
Depending on your macOS version the UI may be under System Settings or System Preferences.
Open System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts.
(In older macOS: System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts tab.)
From the sidebar select Services (or Quick Actions).
Scroll until you see your Open Terminal service under General.
Click on it, then click add shortcut, and press Control+Command+T.
Close Settings.
3. Test It
Switch to any app (Safari, Mail, Finder—even full-screen).
Press ⌃+⌘+T.
A new Terminal window should pop right up.
Now you have a true Linux-style “open terminal” hot-key on macOS.
How to add "Open in Terminal" on right-click menu to Finder on MacOS (the right way)
Open Automator and create a new Quick Action
Launch Automator (via Spotlight or /Applications/Automator.app).
Click New Document → choose Quick Action → Choose.
Configure the Quick Action’s input
At the top of the workflow pane set:
Workflow receives current → folders
in → Finder.app
Input is → Enabled
Add a “Run AppleScript” action
In the left Library, search for Run AppleScript and drag it into the workflow.
Replace its default code with the following:
on run {input, parameters}
-- Process each selected folder
repeat with theItem in input
set thePath to POSIX path of theItem
tell application "Terminal"
activate
-- open a new window/tab and cd into the folder
do script "cd " & quoted form of thePath
end tell
end repeat
return input
end run
This tells Terminal to open (if not already) and run cd /path/to/selected-folder in a new window/tab for each selected folder.
Save the Quick Action
Hit ⌘S, name it exactly:
Open in Terminal
Close Automator.
Enable it in Finder’s contextual menu
In Finder, right-click any folder → Quick Actions (or Services on older macOS) → you should see Open in Terminal.
Selecting it runs your Automator action and pops open Terminal at that folder’s path.
Tip: If you’d like it to appear all the way at the top of your right-click menu, open System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Quick Actions (or Services), find Open in Terminal, and check Show in Context Menu or assign it a hotkey.
