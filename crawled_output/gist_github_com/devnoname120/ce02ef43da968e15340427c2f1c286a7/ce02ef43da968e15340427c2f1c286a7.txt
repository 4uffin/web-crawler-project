Xorg/X11 forwarding on macOS and docker
In order to run Xorg apps on macOS you will need to install xquartz:
brew install --cask --no-quarantine xquartz
And then configure it
defaults write org.xquartz.X11 nolisten_tcp -bool false
defaults write org.xquartz.X11 no_auth -bool false
defaults write org.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true
mkdir -p ~/.xinitrc.d
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.xinitrc.d/xhost-config.sh
#!/bin/sh
xhost +127.0.0.1
xhost +localhost
xhost +\$(hostname)
EOF
chmod +x ~/.xinitrc.d/xhost-config.sh
open -a XQuartz
No need to restart anything or log in/out.
You can then run Xorg apps easily:
docker run -e DISPLAY=docker.for.mac.host.internal:0 petedavidson887/xclock:0.0.1
Note that you will still need to explicitly provide the DISPLAY env variable every time you run a Docker container. As far as I know there is no way to set a default env variable for all containers — at least not on Docker for macOS.
Troubleshooting
Windows have a black background instead of white when they are focused
Run the following, then restart XQuartz:
defaults write org.xquartz.X11 enable_render_extension -bool false
If the misbehaving app is a Java app you can try adding the following option to your docker run command:
-e JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS='-Dsun.java2d.xrender=false -Dsun.java2d.pmoffscreen=false -Dremote.x11.workaround=false -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd -Dsun.java2d.renderer=sun.java2d.marlin.MarlinRenderingEngine -Djava2d.font.loadFontConf=true'
(source)
libGL error with a driver load failure
If you have the following error: libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast then you can attempt to add this argument to your docker run command:
-e LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1

Thanks for the easy to follow instruction. I'm on OSX 15.3 (24D60) M1 and I'm still getting this error: Error: Can't open display: docker.for.mac.host.internal:0 :( Suggestions what needs to be updated?
Sorry, something went wrong.
Uh oh!

@HerrMuellerluedenscheid Can you try this instead?
docker run -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 petedavidson887/xclock:0.0.1
Sorry, something went wrong.

I suddenly started getting Error: Can't open display: host.docker.internal:0 when running X11 apps through docker today, every time before it worked perfectly, has anyone else experienced this? I'm on:
XQuartz 2.8.5 (xorg-server 21.1.6)
Docker version 27.4.0, build bde2b89
MacOS 15.3.2
Sorry, something went wrong.

@josephH00 You forgot to add -e DISPLAY=docker.for.mac.host.internal:0 in the arguments of your docker run or in the environment of your Dockerfile. The host.docker.internal:0 is for Windows only. I just followed again the tutorial on macOS Sequoia 15.5, XQuartz 2.8.5, Docker version 27.5.1, and I confirm that it still works without any issue.
