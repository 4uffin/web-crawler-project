Shelly script to revert to direct switch control if Home Assistant is not available
Raw
shelly_with_ha.js
// Preconditions:
// Shelly connected to a manual switch and to a smart light
// Shelly set to disconnected mode and to restore power to on after power loss
// Input mode is button (might need a minor change for switch - untested)
// Shelly is added to Home Assistant
// An automation is created in Home Assistant to toggle the light when single button press is
// detected on the Shelly (other automations may also exist)
let online_status = 0;
// Change this to the URL of your Home Assistant base URL + "/api/ping"
let ha_url = "http://home-ha:8123/api/ping";
// This returns a 404 error if the HA is available and timeout or connection error if it is not there
// Process response from the HA URL, the 404 error would be part of the result variable
function processHttpResponse(result, error_code, error) {
if (error_code !== 0) {
online_status = 0
print("Offline")
} else {
online_status = 1
print("Online")
}
}
// Initiate the online check. This will return immediately - before the check completes
function do_online_check(){
Shelly.call("HTTP.GET", {url: ha_url, timeout: 1}, processHttpResponse);
}
// Whenever input button is pushed - if we are online, then do nothing (Home Assistant will handle
// the light switching), else do the switching directly by cutting power
// Also checks if we are online, but for latency reasons this will not affect the current event, but it
// will be ready for the follow-up events, so if HA goes down and we try to use the switch manually within
// first 5 minutes of the outage, we would need to press the switch again about 1 second later.
Shelly.addEventHandler(function(e) {
if (e.component === "input:0") {
if (e.info.event === "single_push") {
print("Button was pushed");
do_online_check();
if ( online_status === 0 ) {
Shelly.call("Switch.toggle", {'id': 0});
}
}
}
});
// Check if we are online every 5 minutes
let atimer = Timer.set(1000*5*60, true, do_online_check);
do_online_check();

Thanks a lot for that helpful script, exactly what I was looking for!
I use it with input mode "switch", therefore i just removed lines 37, 38 and 43 from your script. works as it should.
Shelly.addEventHandler(function(e) {
if (e.component === "input:0") {
do_online_check();
if ( online_status === 0 ) {
Shelly.call("Switch.toggle", {'id': 0});
}
}
Sorry, something went wrong.
Uh oh!

Yes, very helpful.
Thank you!
I made the same changes as @andreasgraf42, but used this block of code after do_online_check(); on relays with smart bulbs:
if ( online_status === 0 ) {
print("Configuring switch for offline use")
Shelly.call("Switch.SetConfig", {'id': 0, config:{"in_mode":"flip","initial_state":"off"}});
}
else {
print("Configuring switch for online use")
Shelly.call("Switch.Set", {'id': 0, "on":true});
Shelly.call("Switch.SetConfig", {'id': 0, config:{"in_mode":"detached","initial_state":"on"}});
}
Sorry, something went wrong.
