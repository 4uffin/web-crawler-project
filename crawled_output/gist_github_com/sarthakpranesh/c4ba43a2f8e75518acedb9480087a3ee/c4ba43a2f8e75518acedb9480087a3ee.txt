Thanks for this. I've been seeing daily SafariPlugInUpdateNotifier crashes on my Mojave system. Started a couple months ago and nothing I've done has stopped it. Running "sudo launchctl remove com.apple.SafariPlugInUpdateNotifier" fixed the issue.
Is there a reason why "sudo launchctl remove com.apple.SafariPlugInUpdateNotifier" is run twice in this script?
Sorry, something went wrong.
Uh oh!
