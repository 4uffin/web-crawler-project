Remove the Â«Code with Copilot Agent ModeÂ» / Â«Code with agent modeÂ» / Â«Your CopilotÂ» button spam from GitHub issues
Install uBlock Origin and add this rule to your filters, blocking this cruft even when Copilot has been technically fully-disabled site-wide in your GitHub account options:
github.com##button[data-testid='open-in-copilot-agent-button']:upward(div[data-testid='sidebar-section'])
/* swy: 'Code with agent mode' button in every issue */
github.com##a[href='/settings/copilot'] svg.octicon-copilot:upward(li[class*='prc-ActionList-ActionListItem']) /* swy: 'Your Copilot' option on sidebar */

PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers Â· Protocol and input notes Â· USB & Bluetooth HID packets
One needs to get HID feature report 5 (calibration) to switch each controller into the extended mode,
unlike DualShock / DualSense they don't seem to report anything (input doesn't work) in the normal
state after just connecting them via standard HID.
data[00] always 0x31
data[01] always 0x_1, with the upper byte being an incrementing counter from 0 to 0xf for each packet and wrapping around
data[02] 0xff - L
/ R
stick X-axis, 0 is left, 0xff is right
(analog) (same field for the respective stick in each controller)
data[03] 0xff - L
/ R
stick Y-axis, 0 is
up, 0xff is
down
(analog) (same field for the respective stick in each controller)
data[04] 0xff - L2 / R2 trigger pull, from 0 to fully pulled at 0xff (analog)

This is intended to be a resource for those who are working on older modifications, or those who are looking to port old modifications to new versions. I dont have anything older than v.0.202, which I just uploaded to the Repository.
