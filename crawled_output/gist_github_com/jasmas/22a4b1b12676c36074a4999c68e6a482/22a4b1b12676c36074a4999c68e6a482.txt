Thanks so much, @jasmas! I've found this content filter can altogether block an internet connection for some of us on Macs when working remotely. I've disabled this within network prefs, but sometimes the only thing that has worked has been to uninstall the filter from apps. I look forward to trying this script the next time it happens on a Mac.
Are you aware of a similar content filter on Windows?

Glad everyone is still enjoying this. I wrote it quite a while ago and unfortunately am no longer as embedded in the Cisco ecosystem.
If it deserves a proper repo and anyone is interested in submitting pull requests, let me know.

I actually quit using command line and had a BitBar script I was using on the Mac to enable and disable it visually from the menu bar.

Hi, I have create a script like this:
#!/bin/sh
echo Disabling vpnagentd...
sudo launchctl disable system/com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd
echo Tearing down vpnagentd...
sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd.plist
echo Deactivating Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter Extension...
'/Applications/Cisco/Cisco Secure Client - Socket Filter.app/Contents/MacOS/Cisco Secure Client - Socket Filter' -deactivateExt
but when I restart the mac the extension is active again and the pop-up appears again.
How can I permanently disable this extension?
Sorry, something went wrong.
