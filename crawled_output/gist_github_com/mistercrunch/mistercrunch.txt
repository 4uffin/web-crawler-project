# Airbnb Almond Cookies
sooo.. i would recommend searching for a ricciarelli recipe that is a much more manageable size then the one i have.
most of the recipes I have found on the internet have them as a diamond shaped cookie that is flat.
i like to make these with a small muffin scoop so they are domed and you get the balance between crunchy and chewy. or.you can play around with amounts of these
## ./configure:
* 1 pound: almond meal
* 1.25 pounds: powdered sugar
* 1/2 Cup: egg whites
* 1/3 Tablespoon baking powder
* to taste: salt

{#
Given a source table and a DATETIME or DATE column, this macro returns
a DATE `YYYY-MM-DD` pointing the the most recent available day.
For streaming tables that come in impredictable batches, the previous_day
flag when on will very likely point to the latest FULL day as we can
safely assume that if we have received event for a given day, the
previous one is complete.
#}
{%- macro latest_dt(source_table, dttm_column="ds", previous_day=False) -%}
