AI 通宵干活 prompt
__This is the requirements section, please replace it yourself__
Above are the requirements, below are the decision-making requirements:
- I'm going to sleep now, all product and technical decisions are under your control, I'll come to review the results tomorrow morning
- I'll sleep for about 8 hours, so don't rush to produce results, take your time with all the details, don't save tokens, getting it right is most important
- When you encounter uncertainties, first check the documentation in context7, if still uncertain, search online
- Execute all subtasks in phases, run unit tests after each phase is completed, to avoid having to start over after completing everything only to find it doesn't work
- Don't get hung up on the UI part, try to use mainstream conventional approaches, I'll polish the details tomorrow, you just focus on getting the functionality working

The fastest way of string concatenation in Oracle PL/SQL
When builing large strings with lots of concatenations in PL/SQL, custom approach like "use varchar2(32000) buffer
to reduce the number of dbms_lob calls" makes sense even for Oracle 12.1.0.2.0.
The response time improvement is 4..300+ times :) depending on the DB version and API you use.
Note that simple v_clob || TO_CHAR (SYSTIMESTAMP) || ', ' ==> v_clob || TO_CLOB(TO_CHAR (SYSTIMESTAMP) || ', ') trick
(note the extra to_clob) makes 24 times improvement for 11g. The trick is bad for 12c where results in 1.5x degradation.
The code was published 4 year ago as an answer to "How to Quickly Append VARCHAR2 to CLOB": http://www.talkapex.com/2009/06/how-to-quickly-append-varchar2-to-clob.html?showComment=1343235921606#c9077980873875311325
