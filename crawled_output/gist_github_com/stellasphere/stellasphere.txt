Better regex matching with better way to access groups
function match(string,regex) {
var matches = []
var m;
// Based on example code from regex101.com
while ((m = regex.exec(string)) !== null) {
// This is necessary to avoid infinite loops with zero-width matches
if (m.index === regex.lastIndex) {
regex.lastIndex++;
}
