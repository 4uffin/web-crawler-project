Reasons why Crucible/Fisheye is better than Github (Enterprise) Pull Requests for reviewing code
GENERAL:
You can't include commits from different repos in a single code review using github pull requests, whereas you can with Crucible code reviews.
It's risky to use a pull request for code that isn't ready to be merged yet. What if someone doesn't see the "DON'T MERGE" comment/title, and clicks the big green merge button?
VIEWING:
You can't adjust the line width in which files are displayed, even if you make your browser window wider than the page. Some XML/HTML content extends well past 80 characters.

You can't choose to ignore white space, so if a change involved indenting a lot of lines, you'll have a hard time figuring out what changed. In Crucible, you can choose to ignore white space.
