<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is a simple app that creates colored Discord messages using the ANSI color codes available on the latest Discord desktop versions.</p>
<p>To use this, write your text, select parts of it and assign colors to them, then copy it using the button below, and send in a Discord message.</p>
<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>This app runs entirely in your browser and the source code is freely available on <a href="https://gist.github.com/rebane2001/07f2d8e80df053c70a1576d27eabe97c">GitHub</a>. Shout out to kkrypt0nn for <a href="https://gist.github.com/kkrypt0nn/a02506f3712ff2d1c8ca7c9e0aed7c06">this guide</a>.</p>

I know it is very, very likely, but I don't think I am in the position of actually accusing someone (the two people might know each other and worked on the project together). But it is very suspicious indeed.

While I don't like that @crossface001 just took my code and only changed the name without leaving credit, I stand by the license (The Unlicense) I apply to my code, which means I will not issue a takedown or anything of that sort. This code is free for anyone to use however they please (and while I do appreciate crediting where appropriate, it is not required).

My bad, was using VenCord and it has a plugin to revamp codeblocks. That was the cause to me not being able to see it. Colors still work.

Could you add a tooltip to the colour buttons that shows the name of that colour? It'd make this much easier for colourblind people to use, myself included.

I don't know if they changed it after the above comment was made, but SpicyDevs' page now— at least —shows "based on" and links back to @rebane2001. That's credit where credit's due, right?
PS - I absolutely love this generator. Thanks, @rebane2001 <3!

this is such a great website! I am working on a discord bot that can change text colors, and this is where I learned about ANSI escape codes.
Thank you, this is awesome!

It's true that this allows for more personalization, this site is more color oriented, and https://discordfont.org is more oriented towards the font style of the site, both of which I use often.
