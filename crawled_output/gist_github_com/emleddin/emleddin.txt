Instructions for using the 8BitDo Micro Remote with ANKI on MacOS
Using the 8BitDo Micro Remote with ANKI
The 8BitDo Micro remote is ~$25 and can be used to gamify your studying.
The Micro is bigger than the Zero 2, but smaller than the SN30 Pro.
See controller image below
The controller comes with preset keybindings to buttons, which don't automatically work with ANKI.
So, through the use of a key remapping software, you’ll update how your device interprets the keys!

Tips for modifying PDFs and saving images.
Modifying PDFs
PDFtk has a command-line tool for working with PDFs.
It's fantastic for saving out single pages or combining files.
Ghostscript also has good features for PDFs, including being able to
reduce the file size while preserving links and bookmarks.

Potential energy surface graph with matplotlib
PES Graph
The Python3 script in this gist will render a reaction path along a potential energy surface (PES) in 3D.
It should work with Matplotlib 1.5.0 and newer (i.e., the script was first written based on mpl 1.5.0).
Python 3.8.5

especially when the program is installed site-wide.

chmidasrc
Chimera Image Rendering
Chimera will source a ~/.chimera/midasrc or .chmidasrc file in the
working directory.
You often need to open the in-program command line (Favorites →
Command Line)
before it is applied.
If a residue doesn't do what you would expect, it may be because Chimera named
it differently.

Common Image Needs -- VMD, PowerPoint, and ImageMagick
Higher-Quality Images
TIFFs are great because they retain image layers (which makes them decently editable).
PNGs offer lossless compression and allow you to have transparent backgrounds.
JPEGs/JPGs are lossy and have their uses, but you're better off avoiding them if you can.
Saving Powerpoint Images with Higher Resolution
PNGs exported from PowerPoint have 72 DPI resolution, which is not ideal for publication.
Instead, export the image file as a PDF.
