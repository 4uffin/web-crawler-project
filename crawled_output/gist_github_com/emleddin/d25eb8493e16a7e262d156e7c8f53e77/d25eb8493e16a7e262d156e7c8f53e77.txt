Instructions for using the 8BitDo Zero 2 with ANKI on Linux and MacOS
Raw
1-ANKI-remote.md
Using the 8BitDo Zero 2 Remote with ANKI
The 8BitDo Zero 2 remote is ~$20 and can be used to gamify your studying.
See controller image below
The controller comes with preset keybindings that aren’t the most helpful.
So, through the use of a key remapping software, you’ll update how your device interprets the keys!
If you don’t want to download a remapper, you should be able to use an
Anki add-on to
change the keyboard shortcuts to match the existing buttons on the device.
Certain add-ons allow you to define add-on specific bindings (such as those for AMBOSS).
If you’re a video person, there are a few tutorials on YouTube. My desktop is Linux, though,
which didn’t have an existing tutorial.
MacOS
Windows
Linux
This works on Ubuntu, but the program has support for other flavors of Linux.
Install input-remapper
Dependencies:
libpython3-dev libdbus-1-dev python3-evdev python3-pydbus libgtksourceview-4-dev python3-pydantic
Turn on your remote by holding Start + R (to enter keyboard mode)
Hold select for 3 seconds to enter pairing mode
Ensure bluetooth is on for your computer, and connect to the controller
Open input-remapper
Enter your password for input monitoring
Select your device in the dropdown at the top
Remap your keys as you wish!
Use new entry in the middle, then select Change key, press the key on the remote,
and it’ll come up with the current mapping. Then, change it to what you want it to be!

Notes
Keep the keys in Keyboard mode, not gamepad mode
Hit apply if you’ve been messing with them. Sometimes you’ll have to use Stop injection
first to update the mappings.
These are just the suggested mappings based off current Anki keyboard shortcuts!
You can reset the AMBOSS key mapping in the AMBOSS add-in,
if you’re using it.
Turning off Bluetooth will turn off the remote automatically! You can also hold the start button to
turn the device off.
MacOS
Install karabiner-elements
Allow it to access input monitoring through the security and privacy menu
Turn on your remote by holding Start + R (to enter keyboard mode)
Hold select for 3 seconds to enter pairing mode
Ensure bluetooth is on for your computer, and connect to the controller
Device should be something like 8BitDo Zero 2 gamepad. DeviceShock will not work for this,
so if that’s what comes up in the Bluetooth discover menu, turn off the device and try again.
Open karabiner-elements
Under Simple Modifications, highlight the 8BitDo device, and then use the letters from the initial keybindings.

Notes
Certain add-ons let you modify the shortcuts (like AMBOSS).
The AMBOSS add-on-specific bindings were changed, since karabiner-elements does not play well with multi-key mappings.
