/ SplitOutsideQuotes.cs
Last active
July 28, 2025 11:45
C# extension methods to split the string by a separator char (or char array), but only when a separator char is outside the quotes. Supports escaping the quotes (\"), so it is possible to use the quotes character itself inside the source string. This solution does not use regex. Includes some additional options to fine tune split results.
/// <summary>
/// Splits the string by specified separator, but only when the separator is outside the quotes.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="source">The source string to separate.</param>
/// <param name="splitChar">The character used to split strings.</param>
/// <param name="trimSplits">If set to <c>true</c>, split strings are trimmed (whitespaces are removed).</param>
/// <param name="ignoreEmptyResults">If set to <c>true</c>, empty split results are ignored (not included in the result).</param>
/// <param name="preserveEscapeCharInQuotes">If set to <c>true</c>, then the escape character (\) used to escape e.g. quotes is included in the results.</param>
public static string[] SplitOutsideQuotes(this string source, char separator, bool trimSplits = true, bool ignoreEmptyResults = true, bool preserveEscapeCharInQuotes = true)

Proxmox PVE Host Config Backup Script
Proxmox PVE Host Config Backup Script
This script can be used to backup essential configuration files from the Proxmox Virtual Enivronment (PVE) host.
The script will create backups using tar with specified backup prefix and date and time stamp in the file name. Script will also delete
backups that are older then number of days specified.
Create backup script file
To create backup script that will be executed every day we can create backup script in /etc/cron.daily/ folder. We need to make it writeable by root (creator) only, but readable and executable by everyone:
touch /etc/cron.daily/pvehost-backup

HP Smart Storage Admin CLI (ssacli) installation and usage on Proxmox PVE (6.x)
HP Smart Storage Admin CLI (ssacli) installation and usage on Proxmox PVE (6.x)
Why use HP Smart Storage Admin CLI?
You can use ssacli (smart storage administrator command line interface) tool to manage any of supported HP Smart Array Controllers in your Proxmox host without need to reboot your server to access Smart Storage Administrator in BIOS.
That means no host downtime when managing your storage.
CLI is not as convenient as GUI interface provided by BIOS or desktop utilities, but still allows you to fully manage your controller, physical disks and logical drives on the fly with no Proxmox host downtime.
ssacli replaces older hpssacli, but shares the same syntax and adds support for newer servers and controllers.
