/ How to auto-refresh auth token in Postman.md

Postman auto-refresh auth token
How to auto-refresh auth token in Postman
This is very common scenario when testing APIs in postman, we have a collection of request and those requests needs to be authenticated first. Most of the time we have to run the auth request first, grab the token from the response and then go request per request and add the token or simple create a variable in Postman and add the token, still saving the token in a variable requires to run the auth request again once the token expires.
Here is a code snippet that can help with that.
📓 Of course there is no code to rule them all, so adjust the code base on your environment variables and data used for authentication.
// Get environment variables

Overloading vs Overriding
Overloading: Is the ability to have multiple methods within the same class with the same name, but with different parameters. Each of these methods has their own implementation as well, meaning that they can behave differently depending on what is passed in.
Overriding: Is the ability to redefine the implementation of a method in a class that inherits from a parent class. When a method is overridden, the name and the parameters stay the same, but the implementation that gets called depends on the type of the object that's calling it.
DI(Dependency Injection) what is and what solve?
DI: Is a software design pattern, which is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. Is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object
Solve: Is a key part of building loosely coupled applications, since implementation details can b
