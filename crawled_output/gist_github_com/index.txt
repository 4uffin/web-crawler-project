/ crDroid OnePlus 6 6T Installation Instructions - Dynamic Partitions.md
Last active

— forked from jabashque/Evolution X OnePlus 6 6T Installation Instructions.md
crDroid OP6/6T installation guide
Pre-Installation:
Starting in crDroid 10.x (Android 14.0) and onwards, we're using retrofitted dynamic partitions to avoid the constant threat of running out of space in the GPT system partition with any sizeable Google Apps package. Don't panic.
This will not permanently alter or damage your device, as it makes no changes to the underlying GPT partition table. Following any ROM's installation guide will overwite the changes, so there are no extra steps to "convert back to normal partitions".
This does mean that you cannot use TWRP or other custom recovery to install crDroid on the OnePlus 6-series, as they do not have the necessary kernel and dynamic partition layout changes compiled in to support the way we're doing things.
