AI ÈÄöÂÆµÂπ≤Ê¥ª prompt
__This is the requirements section, please replace it yourself__
Above are the requirements, below are the decision-making requirements:
- I'm going to sleep now, all product and technical decisions are under your control, I'll come to review the results tomorrow morning
- I'll sleep for about 8 hours, so don't rush to produce results, take your time with all the details, don't save tokens, getting it right is most important
- When you encounter uncertainties, first check the documentation in context7, if still uncertain, search online
- Execute all subtasks in phases, run unit tests after each phase is completed, to avoid having to start over after completing everything only to find it doesn't work
- Don't get hung up on the UI part, try to use mainstream conventional approaches, I'll polish the details tomorrow, you just focus on getting the functionality working

8BitDo Firmware Updater in Wine
This is about running 8BitDo's Firmware Update tool for Windows in Wine. It can be used for updating newer 8BitDo devices that may not be supported by fwupd on Linux. This tool uses .NET Framework, so it will need Wine Mono to be installed (dotnet48 wintericks verb was tested to work as well).
This tool needs Segoe UI Symbol font, on Arch this font is provided by ttf-ms-win10-auto package. For other distributions there is install script.
You will have to let Wine access device's HID interface for updating the firmware. Most importantly it should be a boot HID interface (exposed when device is in bootloader mode, often referred to as "manual update mode" or "advanced mode"). It is also worth adding the Product IDs for HID interfaces that are exposed under different conditions (for example, Ultimate Bluetooth Controller's receiver exposes a HID interface when controller is not connected),

How to add Ctrl + Alt + T keyboard shortcut similar to Linux to open Terminal on MacOS (2025 guide)
How to add Ctrl + Alt + T keyboard shortcut similar to Linux to open Terminal on MacOS (‚åÉ + ‚åò + T 2025 how-to guide)
On macOS there is no global ‚Äúopen Terminal‚Äù shortcut out of the box.
Option (‚å•)+‚åò+T is already used in Finder to show/hide the toolbar.
Control (‚åÉ)+‚åò+T isn‚Äôt assigned system-wide (only in some apps for context-specific commands), so it‚Äôs free to grab for a global hot-key.
Below is a Linux-style setup using Automator + System Settings so that ‚åÉ+‚åò+T will launch Terminal no matter which app you‚Äôre in.
