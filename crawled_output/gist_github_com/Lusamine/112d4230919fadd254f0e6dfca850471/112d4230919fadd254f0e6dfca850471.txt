Anubis's Item Printer Seeds.md
Introduction
This page will link to gists containing all the useful seeds I've found thus far for the Item Printer. The seeds are a representation of the time the Item Printer was opened.
These seeds were found by checking every second from 1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM to 12/31/2060 11:59:59 PM. Seeds beyond the limit that can be set on the Switch will take too long.
All times are the exact second that the game uses to generate items. You'll need to calibrate 1-2 seconds before so that clicking "I want to print something!" to start the Item Printer fades to black on the correct second. The format uses 24-hour time.
These seeds assume that you have upgraded the Item Printer to Master Ball.
Master Ball unlocks both Poké Ball Lotto and Stellar Tera Shards. Ultra Ball unlocks only Poké Ball Lotto.
At Ultra Ball, you can RNG manipulate for Poké Balls only. You'll need to trigger a Poké Ball Lotto (item may not match perfectly), then back out completely to the club room before attempting a seed for balls.
You cannot reliably use combo seeds or RNG manipulate for any items with variable quantities until you have unlocked Stellar Tera Shards at Master Ball; some items will be wrong! (This would only be possible by calculating new seeds for those scenarios, but I don't want to do that since it takes a lot of computation time.)
You can refer to Serebii to learn how to upgrade the Item Printer. I will not be covering gameplay to get to this point.
Why do you use 5-print seeds?
If 5-print or 10-print seeds exist that give all of the same item, I listed them. I did not search 10-print seeds for very rare items, because twice as much material is used for little additional gain.
For example, the combo seed for 10-print Exp. Candy gets at most 960000 experience, but the combo seed for 5-print Exp. Candy gets at most 852800. You'd be using double the materials for about 110k more experience.
Think of it like trying to flip a coin and get heads 5 times in a row versus 10 times in a row. In many cases, you're better off using a 5-print seed twice. With 10 prints available per bonus, you can attempt two 5-print jobs, and if you land both, you get more items for the materials spent!
Notation
Here are some examples to explain the notation for these seeds.
Example 1
This seed from the assorted rare balls list is 2745147720, which translates to December 27, 2056 at 1:02:00 PM. Since the seconds are so low, the only way you could hit this seed is by setting to an earlier time, such as 1:01:00 PM, and wait the whole minute. This seed is not that great for that reason!
2745147720, 2056-12-27 13:02:00
x1 Sport Ball
x1 Dream Ball
x1 Safari Ball
x1 Moon Ball
x1 Fast Ball
x1 Master Ball
x1 Fast Ball
x1 Level Ball
x1 Dream Ball
x1 Moon Ball
--> Print 1 in regular mode to trigger ball bonus.
x11 Fairy Tera Shard
What does the message at the end mean? After you print all 10 jobs with the ball bonus, you'll return to regular mode, and if you immediately print 1 extra item without backing out to the club room, you'll get 11 Fairy Tera Shards and another ball bonus.
Example 2
1841229082, 2028-05-06 12:31:22
62 Water Tera Shards, 62 total Tera Shards
x9 Tiny Mushroom
x19 Water Tera Shard
x14 Water Tera Shard
x14 Water Tera Shard
x15 Water Tera Shard
--> Print job triggers item bonus if used in regular mode.
This seed from the regular Tera Shards list has a different message at the end. If you use this seed with no bonus active, it will trigger an item bonus.
Troubleshooting
Here are some tools for troubleshooting if you're having trouble hitting these times.
Seeds are provided so you can enter them in ItemPrinterDeGacha and see whether you were too early or too late.
If you have the date and time but no seed, you can convert it with a site like https://www.epochconverter.com/.
Download the latest build of ItemPrinterDeGacha. Select a run and Download Artifact on the bottom.
Ensure that you have meet the requirements for Item Printer upgrades! This seems to be a common problem.
Here's my write-up for how the Item Printer RNG manipulation works.
Basic Seed Lists
These are basic seeds that result in the exact rewards if used correctly. They are sorted by whether a bonus is active or not.
Regular Mode
These lists are for using the Item Printer without any bonus.
Tera Shards
Tera Shards (Single Type): 5 print. Seeds that aim to maximize a particular Tera Shard type. Minimum 60 shards for standard types and 40 shards for Stellar, which is rarer.
Tera Shards (Assorted): 10 print. Seeds that aim to maximize total number of assorted Tera Shards. Minimum 140 shards.
Competitive Items
Ability Patch: 5 print. Minimum 7.
Exp. Candy: 5 print. Shows only the seeds that give more than 480k experience per print.
Gold Bottle Cap: 5 print. There's only 1 good seed here.
PP Max: 5 print. Minimum 9.
Evolution Items
Evolution Items: 5 print. Does not include sweets. All seeds only produce 5 unique items. Focuses on the evolution items that can't be purchased with LP/$.
Alcremie Sweets: 5 print. All seeds only produce 5 unique sweets.
2× Item Bonus Mode
These lists are for using the Item Printer with the item bonus mode. While similar to seeds for regular mode, certain seeds do not always translate to 2x the same items in item bonus mode. Item quantities are after the 2x bonus has been applied.
Tera Shards
Tera Shards (Single Type): 5 print. Seeds that aim to maximize a particular Tera Shard type. Minimum 120 shards for standard types and 80 shards for Stellar, which is rarer.
Tera Shards (Assorted): 10 print. Seeds that aim to maximize total number of assorted Tera Shards. Minimum 280 shards.
Competitive Items
Ability Patch: 5 print. Minimum 14.
Exp. Candy: 5 print. Shows only the seeds that give more than 960k experience per print.
Gold Bottle Cap: 5 print. There's only 1 good seed here.
PP Max: 5 print. Minimum 18.
Poké Ball Lotto Mode
Poké Ball seeds require you to trigger a Poké Ball Lotto first. The quantity cannot be doubled.
Rare Balls (Single Type): 5 print. Seeds that aim to maximize one particular rare ball. Some more common balls at the end as 10 print.
Rare Balls (Assorted): 10 print. All seeds that give 10 assorted rare balls.
Combo Seed Lists
These seeds require you to target a specific time as a 1-print job to trigger an item or ball bonus, then immediately do another print job without exiting the Item Printer. These can be easier since there are fewer targets to hit, but rewards are more limited.
Tera Shards
Tera Shards (Single Type): 5 print. Print 1 to trigger item bonus, then print 5. These seeds aim to maximize a particular Tera Shard type. Minimum 100 shards for standard types and 60 shards for Stellar, which is rarer.
Tera Shards (Assorted): 10 print. Seeds that aim to maximize total number of assorted Tera Shards. Minimum 240 shards.
Competitive Items
Ability Patch: 5 print. Minimum 12.
Exp. Candy: 5 print. Shows only the seeds that give more than 750k experience per print.
Exp. Candy: 10 print. Shows only the seeds that give more than 900k experience per print.
Gold Bottle Cap: 5 print. Minimum 10.
PP Max: 5 print.
There's only 1 good seed here (and it's just as good as the other PP Max seeds).
Poké Balls
Rare Balls (Single Type): 5 print. Seeds that aim to maximize one particular rare ball.
Rare Balls (Assorted): 10 print. All seeds that give 9-10 assorted rare balls.
Credits
Initial discovery and testing: stella_ssa and eshippoiya. There are innumerable many others in the Pokémon community who tested empirically that I cannot name here.
I personally researched the RNG calls of the Item Printer, and described them to my partner-in-crime, Kaphotics. He is responsible for ItemPrinterDeGacha and the initial item table dumps you see on Serebii.
All seeds on this page were generated by my scripts. I wrote some code and also used code from IPDG. Others may have posted them first by finding them in other ways, but I did not reference them.
