A brief description of how the game determines when your follower is eligible to give you an item gift.
Follower Item Gifts
In PokÃ©mon Let's Go, Pikachu and PokÃ©mon Let's Go, Eevee, there is a minor feature where your following PokÃ©mon can give you an item as a gift when you talk to it. Note that this is distinct from your following PokÃ©mon finding items in bushes and craters, and does not include your partner Pikachu or Eevee. Simply talking to your follower is enough for this event to happen. Serebii has some initial information about this.
SBCoop told me that he had been approached about this feature and wanted more information. Some preliminary testing has revealed that the item pool is location-dependent and is typically berries, the PokÃ©mon evolution stage does not matter, and at least some ride PokÃ©mon (e.g. Starmie) may not be able to give an item at all.

Assorted list of functions I looked at that affect the camp behavior in SWSH. All of this is from Sword 1.3.2. Most labels are mine, some are copied from BDSP.
camp_determine_initial_behavior: used to decide what behavior a PokÃ©mon should be doing when entering camp or leaving a curry
camp_decide_groups: decides which PokÃ©mon should be doing group activities prior to randomly picking initial behavior
camp_get_random_behavior_enum: affects random behaviors when wandering around camp
camp_check_run_up_to_player: decides if they need to run up to the player (not item-related)
camp_item_get_success: checks if a PokÃ©mon successfully finds an item

Overview
Each day in Legends: Arceus lasts 24 minutes, and each real-time minute is one in-game hour.
In-game time is saved; if you save and reboot your game, it will start at the same time. The save block for in-game time is 203A7F34 and stores a double value equal to the number of minutes. The function that converts this to the hour is at sub_71024AB9F0 in version 1.1.1.
There are 4 different times of day, which I will call Dawn, Day, Dusk, and Night. I do not believe that there are official names, but you may see other names such as Dawn = Morning, Day = Midday, Dusk = Evening on various fansites.
Times will be written as 24-hour time. You can subtract 12 to get the 12-hour time if you prefer.
I recorded a video of the full day cycle, which also shows when Night starts and ends [video]. The hour is displayed on the top right. You may notice the hour actually ticks to 24 very briefly, and the game immediately corrects it to 0 [[video](https://youtu.be/bOxToygZIl8

Most of this research was done by wwwwwwzx in 2018: https://x.com/wwwwwwzx/status/979949167224045568
Since most of this was already done, I used the XY radar as an introduction to debugging 3DS games. I won't be providing much info on how to play the game because I literally haven't done anything in-game besides look at the PokÃ© Radar the moment my cartridge arrived. Huge thanks to SirToastyToes for helping me understand this part of the game!
New Things I Learned
I was able to solve the unknown condition that causes 4% upbeat music rate--it's the player's birthday!
We found some methods to force it to be your birthday ingame:
The birth date that matters is in the 3DS bio, not the one attached to the NNID. You can change this birth date without penalty.

This code is executed when the PokÃ© Radar item is used and when finishing a battle that continues the chain.
The special music:
Each time the chain continues, there is a chance for the radar music to change into a more upbeat tune. The chance for this to occur is 2% normally and 4% if it is the player's birthday.
When the upbeat music is playing, the shiny rate is maxed out at 1/100, which is the normal rate after a chain of 40+.
The upbeat music cannot start with a chain of 0 or when the PokÃ© Radar is used.
If the upbeat music is already playing, each time the radar is used or an encounter to +1 the chain finishes, there is a 50% chance the upbeat music changes back to the regular music.
