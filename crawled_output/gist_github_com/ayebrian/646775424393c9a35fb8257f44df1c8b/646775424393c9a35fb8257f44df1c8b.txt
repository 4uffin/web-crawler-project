Does anybody know what is going to happen with this keys if Broadcom comes up with their new license systems.
I have experience with ESXi but if this keys stop working I might try out Proxmox for my new build

It works for now. But I'm migrating my home lab to XOA.
The biggest part I hate is all nics on all servers have to be named the same in a cluster. I love VMware.
But Broadcom has ruined it.

From these source, which file actually? I'm a bit confuse, there is file name example
VMware-ESXi-8.0U3c-24414501-depot.zip
and
VMware-VMvisor-Installer-8.0U3b-24280767.iso
so is it the iso of depot.zip that need to extract?

what's purpose use ESXi? Proxmox is free
ESXi used to be free "for life", but if you wanted to cluster or do anything more then just a single host, you have to pay $$$$" Then broadcom said NOPE, no more freebee's!!!
Pay us 15x what you did to vmware and we'll give you the privilage of LEASING this software for another year. and invalidated all the previous lifetime licesnes that everyone owned as Vmware used a paid once model for licenses and just paid for maintenance/upgrades/updates
ProxMox is relativily new in this space and VMWare you have a TON more advanced items you can do in enterprise enviroments and even home labs.
ProxMox is limited in its capabilities, but they are making it better and better.
VMWare was the KING of virtualization.
Broadcom has seen to it that they will die after Broadcom squeezes every last red cent out of it, like they do...
I have worked on VMWare now for over 13 years and certified on many versions/systems.
It took me a bit to get used to ProxMox.
XOA is what I tested out first, but they have even MUCH LESS available to do, i.e. network/vnetwork.
ProxMox can do a bunch of things via Scripts/CLI/API, so that is a plus, but automating functions and lifecycles and stuff, there is no out of the box systems (like vmware 6 years ago or so, before vops and vrealize),
But trying to automate in ProxMox is proving dificult for myself, but I have to migrate my 2 clusters:
Cluster 1 - Legacy Vmware:
3 HP DL380 G9s
368GB ECC RAM in ea
40 vCPU's in ea (2x 10 Core CPU's w/hyperthreading, so 20v cores ea, and 40 in each server)
8x 1.2TB SSD SAS SFF drives in ea
6x 10Gbps SFP+ ports in ea
about 60 VM's running (mix of Ubuntu Server, Windows Server 2019/2022, Windows 11, Windows 10, Various appliances that are Linux based (i.e. Load Balancer, Home Assistant, VCenter, PBX, Others.)
Cluster 2 - ProxMox New Cluster (will fold VMWare cluster into ProxMox after server migration is completed.
(NEW CLUSTER I am building now)
3 HP DL360P G10
256GB ECC Ram ea
80 vCPU's in ea (2x 20 core CPU's w/hyperthreading)
8x 1.2 TB SSD SAS SFF drives in ea
6x 10Gbps SFP+ ports in ea
Only have a few VM's on it so far as this is still getting fully setup and up and running to replace the old ones.
I run TrueNas on an HP DL360 G8:
NetApp 4246 running 24 12TB SAS Drives
8x 1.2TB SSD SAS SFF Drives on the server for the ZFS ables/data/fastcache/etc.
392GB ECC RAM
Each host has 2 aggragated in active/active config, so a 20 Gbps link between each host to a dedicated massive switch for only traffice between the TrueNas to each host on their own VNLAN/Subnet, so that way all traffic for the VM disks has that 20Gbps link back to the TrueNAS.
Makes the VM's run SUPER FAST!!!!
Each of the other hosts has then two aggragated 10Gbps to eachother, so 4 total, going to 2x 20Gpbs links (active/acitve load balanced round robin with packets, so traffic is SUPER FAST) from the hosts to my other massive aggragation switch.
and all my other network conencts to it over a 20Gbps backbone that my entire nework has running downt he back.
Oh yeah, and this is all in my home lab... I think I have an addiction...
HAHAAHAHAHAHA
I miss the massive virtual networking that vmware could do...
from virtual firewalls for massive networks to smaller ones.
Helping isolate traffic, internal vlans and routing, setup a set of virtual switches between DC's/clusters/containers, and much more.
Proxmox gives some network capabilities, so for that i'm atleast greatful more then XOA's... :(.

The license works for me. You have to make sure you are applying it to the correct version. I.e. this license will not work with vCenter with vsan, only vCenter 8 std. I applied to my 4 node homelab with with each server with 40x vcpu/396gb RAM/25gblinks with trunas running my NetApp disk shelf with zfs and came up as unlimited licenses.when installed.
Also, after you install the license you have to enable it in vCenter administration under licenses and applu the license to each host in the cluster and the vcenter appliance itself.
I'm trying to determine whether the licenses shared here will work for a lab environment running vSAN. I've been hesitant to upgrade my home lab from vSphere 7 to 8, since it looks like I’ll need a v8 versions of my current licenses i.e. vSAN Enterprise Plus, vSphere 8 Enterprise Plus, and vCenter Server 8 Standard.
A few months ago, I used the following gist to get vROps up and running again, and it worked great — so perhaps this will help others.
🔗 https://gist.github.com/DnsKzn/60e190caa4d630afe77c0bc85a5a307b
That said, I'm a bit concerned about relying on any of the shared keys for upgrading to 8.x, especially for vSAN. I tried entering several of the v8 keys above into my current vCenter 7 UI under Add License, but none were accepted. I’m not sure if the licenses only register after the product is installed or if there’s another catch I’m missing.
Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. I only have a small home lab with around a dozen VMs — it's primarily for personal learning and staying sharp on the platform. Just want to make sure I can upgrade safely without losing vSAN functionality.

I did upgrade using the vcenter lifecycle manager:
I uploaded the 8.0U3g image and the dell package from the custom iso directory.
The i define in the esxi update the image and the vendor package.
its allowed me to do the upgrade without a problems.
