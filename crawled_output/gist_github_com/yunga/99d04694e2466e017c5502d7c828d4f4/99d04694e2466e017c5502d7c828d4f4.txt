Chocolatey Cheat Sheet

Chocolatey
Homepage: Chocolatey.org
Chocolatey is a machine-level package manager and installer for software packages, built for the Windows NT platform.
It is an execution engine using the NuGet packaging infrastructure and Windows PowerShell to provide an automation tool for installing software on Windows machines, designed to simplify the process from the user perspective.
The name is an extension on a pun of NuGet (from "nougat") "because everyone loves Chocolatey nougat".
Chocolatey can be invoked by the PackageManagement module (Formerly 'OneGet') of PowerShell version 5.0.
Wikipedia:NuGet#Chocolatey
Installation
To Install Chocolatey, from a Powershell Administrator console, simply do:
Set-Location $env:USERPROFILE
If ( ! ( Test-Path $PROFILE ) ) { New-Item -Force -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE; Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Encoding UTF8 -Value "# Powershell Profile"; }
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
RefreshEnv.cmd
And you're ready to go.
If you want a window interface instead of the powershell console, you can do: choco install chocolateygui.
Powershell Auto-Completion
The second line in the previous listing creates your powershell $PROFILE file.
If it doesn't already exist, Chocolatey will not add auto-completion to it.
In case you missed it, or if you would like to add it yourself, open your $PROFILE and copy/paste the following lines:
# Chocolatey
$ChocolateyProfile = "$env:ChocolateyInstall\helpers\chocolateyProfile.psm1"
if (Test-Path($ChocolateyProfile)) {
Import-Module "$ChocolateyProfile"
}
