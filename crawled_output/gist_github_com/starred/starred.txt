About this document
This is a document where I (claydolwithexplosion, Mettrich) dump information I found about Pokemon Emerald ACE. A lot of this is the result of my own research (reading through the great disassembly by pret, reading disassembly), but some of this is knowledge I gathered from people before me. Credits:

8BitDo Firmware Updater in Wine
This is about running 8BitDo's Firmware Update tool for Windows in Wine. It can be used for updating newer 8BitDo devices that may not be supported by fwupd on Linux. This tool uses .NET Framework, so it will need Wine Mono to be installed (dotnet48 wintericks verb was tested to work as well).
This tool needs Segoe UI Symbol font, on Arch this font is provided by ttf-ms-win10-auto package. For other distributions there is install script.
You will have to let Wine access device's HID interface for updating the firmware. Most importantly it should be a boot HID interface (exposed when device is in bootloader mode, often referred to as "manual update mode" or "advanced mode"). It is also worth adding the Product IDs for HID interfaces that are exposed under different conditions (for example, Ultimate Bluetooth Controller's receiver exposes a HID interface when controller is not connected),

The Ultimate Git Alias Setup
The Ultimate Git Alias Setup
If you use git on the command-line, you'll eventually find yourself wanting aliases for your most commonly-used commands.
It's incredibly useful to be able to explore your repos with only a few keystrokes that eventually get hardcoded into muscle memory.
Some people don't add aliases because they don't want to have to adjust to not having them on a remote server.
Personally, I find that having aliases doesn't mean I that forget the underlying commands, and aliases provide such a massive improvement to my workflow that it would be crazy not to have them.
The simplest way to add an alias for a specific git command is to use a standard bash alias.
