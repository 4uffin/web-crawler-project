8BitDo Firmware Updater in Wine
This is about running 8BitDo's Firmware Update tool for Windows in Wine. It can be used for updating newer 8BitDo devices that may not be supported by fwupd on Linux. This tool uses .NET Framework, so it will need Wine Mono to be installed (dotnet48 wintericks verb was tested to work as well).
This tool needs Segoe UI Symbol font, on Arch this font is provided by ttf-ms-win10-auto package. For other distributions there is install script.
You will have to let Wine access device's HID interface for updating the firmware. Most importantly it should be a boot HID interface (exposed when device is in bootloader mode, often referred to as "manual update mode" or "advanced mode"). It is also worth adding the Product IDs for HID interfaces that are exposed under different conditions (for example, Ultimate Bluetooth Controller's receiver exposes a HID interface when controller is not connected),

A generic Burp Suite Bambdas Custom Action that finds the most recent Proxy history entry matching configurable filters (host/path/method/status/scope/highlight; plus request/response regex gates), extracts values (e.g., Cookie, aura.context, aura.token) via regex, and applies them to the current Repeater request—replacing the Cookie header and …
// ============================================================================
// Repeater Action: Pull tokens/values from Proxy History & Apply to THIS item
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IT DOES
//
1) Scans Proxy history (most recent first) for an entry that matches your filters.
//
2) Extracts values (Cookie header, form params, etc.) via regex extractors.
//
3) Applies the extracted values to the CURRENT Repeater request (requestResponse).
//
// HOW TO USE / EDIT (TL;DR)
//
- Set filters in CONFIG (host/path/method/status/in-scope/highlight). Blank = ignored.
