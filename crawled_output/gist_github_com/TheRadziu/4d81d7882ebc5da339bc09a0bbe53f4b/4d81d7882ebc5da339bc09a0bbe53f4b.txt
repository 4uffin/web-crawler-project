Ultimate Vita Comparison (Firmwares & Rips vs Dumps)
Raw
ultimate-vita-comparison.md
Due to so many misinformation, false claims and confusion that goes around the web I've decided to make this quick comparison of all most known backup enabling tools, hackable vita firmwares and which one you should be using and why.

5Using Compability Packs or reF00D or 0syscall6
Conclusion
STOP using Dumped Games and tools for dumping all together. Those tools are obsolete and broken to their cores, due to the way how they work. Eboot and Modules are altered in order to keep everything together, which introduces a handful of bugs. For best Vita Experience use NoNpDRM rips.

1This is recent change. No one can tell why SONY allowed 3.60 hacked consoles to use activation servers again. Use with caution on 3.60.
2Using MLTHaKu
3Only if:
Used MLTHaKu on 3.60 -> IMCUnlockLite to create internal ux0 -> 3.65 OFW Update(+h-encore +3.65 enso installer) OR 3.68 OFW Update(+h-encore)
While being on hackable FW already, memory card is used at least once in order to install hack, then create internal ux0 with IMCUnlockLite
4Using Compability Packs or reF00D or 0syscall6.
5Using iTLS-Enso.
6Using Adrenaline
8Using DolcePolce
9Using RePatch through /RePatch/ directory. Note: 3.60 supports it natively in /patch/ directory, although for consistency sake, rePatch usage is recommended.
10Using CustomWarning
11Using Custom Boot Splash
12Using Chovy-Sign
13Using Modoru(Applies to 3.61-3.70)
14Using Forked Modoru(Applies to 3.71-3.73)
Conclusion
Your best option are ENSO firmwares, but depending what FW you had factory installed you might be limited to 3.68 h-encore only.
Personally, I do suggest upgrading or downgrading to 3.60 ENSO or 3.65 ENSO for permanent hack on boot, most features you can use and having FW that are supported by most if not all scene devs. IF YOU ARE ON 3.71-3.73, USE FORKED MODORU. IF YOU ATTEMPT TO DOWNGRADE FROM 3.71-3.73 USING ORIGINAL MODORU IT SOFTBRICKS THE CONSOLE!

split 3.67-3.70 to 3.67-3.68 & 3.69-3.70 as they use different hacks and homebrew compatibity on 3.69+ is not really good.
I'll fork this file and make the changes feel free to merge/pull.
Sorry, something went wrong.
Uh oh!

This post is to confirm that rePatch (Support decrypted contents in /patch/) does not work on 3.73 by 3 users.
Users will think it's working fine upon power on but will randomly reboot the vita.

From what I saw, TheOfficialFloW updated his modoru a few day ago based on changes from v2.1 by SKGleba.
