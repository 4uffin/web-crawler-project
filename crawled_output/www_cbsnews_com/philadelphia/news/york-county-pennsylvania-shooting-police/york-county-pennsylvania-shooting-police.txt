"The grief will be unbearable, but we will bear it," Paris said during a press conference at the hospital where the injured officers are being treated, WellSpan York Hospital.Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro described Wednesday as an "absolutely tragic and devastating day" for the county and the commonwealth."I think it's important for you to know that these families who are dealing with — they're grieving right now and they're suffering right now — took the time to tell us … how proud they are of their loved ones who put on a uniform to keep us safe," Shapiro said. "It's an extraordinary thing that these law enforcement families do; they support the individual who puts on the uniform and runs toward danger."
Shapiro also ordered the U.S. and Pennsylvania flags at state facilities and public buildings and grounds be lowered to half-staff in honor of the officers who died.The hospital confirmed it is treating two people who are "in serious condition" related to the incident and said "enhanced security protocols" were in place at the facility immediately following the incident.Pennsylvania Lt.
