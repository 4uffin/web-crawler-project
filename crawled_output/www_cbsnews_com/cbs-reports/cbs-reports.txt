Is America in a New Gilded Age? | CBS Reports
When tech billionaires were given a front row-seat at the latest presidential inauguration — and the world's richest man gained unprecedented power over federal agencies — questions about the growing influence of today's tycoons took center stage. Is America in a new Gilded Age, or is this just the latest chapter in its struggle to balance wealth, power and democracy?

The Price of Milk | CBS Reports
The economy and immigration are two of the biggest issues on the minds of Americans, but we rarely get a look behind the scenes to see how these key forces in American life intersect.

Ultra Processed | Food Tech & the American Diet
Americans are among the world's biggest consumers of ultra-processed foods, which comprise more than half of an average adult’s diet and two-thirds of a child’s. As technology continues to accelerate innovations in additives, chemicals and food products, U.S. regulators are struggling to keep up. CBS Reports examines why ultra-processed foods have become so pervasive in the American diet, and what filling the gaps in federal regulation can do to ensure Americans are fed and healthy.

Does Big Plastic's Idea Work? | CBS Reports
As America grapples with an escalating plastic crisis, the city of Houston, ExxonMobil and other partners announced a new program that promised to recycle nearly all of the city's plastic waste. However, after two years, the program has yet to fully materialize. Critics argue that the evidence suggests it never will. And yet, the company envisions similar programs in other American cities. CBS Reports and Inside Climate News investigate whether this proposed solution to our plastic recycling crisis is indeed too good to be true.

Finding Common Ground | CBS Reports
Los Angeles is home to one of the largest populations of Jews in the world, and one of the largest populations of Muslims in America. For almost two decades, a group there has been trying to build bonds between these two communities, but the attack of Oct. 7, 2023 and its aftermath are putting that mission to the test.

Model Prisons: California's Push for Reform
Nearly 95% of people currently in prison will be released back into society, and historically a significant percentage are likely to reoffend. In California, authorities are trying to change that by providing inmates access to education, work and other rehabilitative privileges — programs that have been shown to reduce recidivism and increase public safety. CBS Reports examines a controversial approach some see as being “soft on crime,” which now may be preventing it.
