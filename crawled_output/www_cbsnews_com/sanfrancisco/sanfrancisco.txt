Skincare brands make billions selling products, including some harmful to young skin, to tweens
Skincare brands make billions of dollars annually selling stuff to children 12 and under, even though dermatologists caution against minors using some of these products that are meant for adults.

That social media marketing is turning many in this generation into so-called "Sephora kids," but they often don't realize that some viral products can harm young skin.
Check out what happened when CBS News California investigative correspondent Julie Watts sent her 11-year-old daughter undercover shopping with her friends.
