This thing and the new FreeDV audio codec BBFM will be a major breakthrough if they can be combined. The codec offers full 8kHz voice deep down into the noise floor without breaking the legacy channel width.That would bring ham radio back to the top of the food chain in terms of digital radios.replyspace_fountain 12 hours ago

Very cool, this was one of the projects I really wanted to build before I knew better. Trying to understand what was involved taught me so much. I couldn’t find what analog to digital converter and digital to analog converter this uses which would be interestingI also think a wider bandwidth would be interesting if impractical. Something like recording everything happening on the 2 meter band would be impractical but very cool. I thinkreplyjasonjayr 12 hours ago

I have an RTL-SDR that can cover 3.2mhz -- and with sufficient storage IO could record just about the whole 2m band.
I want to see if I could find or develop a SDR app that could visualize like sdrpp, or the other popular ones, but keep a 1-2 minute ring buffer of the data so I could jump back to previously spotted signals when watching a band.replyNeywiny 11 hours ago

Feels like you could put a PR in on this? https://github.com/SarahRoseLives/rtl_tcp_echoreplyK0balt 6 hours ago

I think this would BOM/build
at about $60
At JLCPCB if you did some minor optimizations for Asian supply chains and ordered >20 at a time, so I think we could see these boards eventually around a $100 price point or even less.I would definitely buy one.replywillis936 10 hours ago

That cost is steep.
For people willing to trade time for money I bet you could get fab and BOM for a fraction of the price from a place like OSHpark and do assembly yourself.replyNoiseBert69 9 hours ago

Depends on your tariffs. In Europe JLCPCB is always an option for PCBs. But as soon you order things with components placed on them you'll go into a different tariff regime and it will be $$$ quickly.replywillis936 8 hours ago

Yeah duties are the silent killer for assemblies.
Safest to go with "local" assembly houses that subcontract and make the true cost transparent.While $100 a unit isn't bad, the $500 buy in is a tough pill to swallow for a solo hobbyist.
This doesn't look super fun to hand assemble either though.reply
