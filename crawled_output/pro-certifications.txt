What hiring managers say “If there’s someone whose background doesn’t necessarily align with what I’m looking for from a recruiting standpoint, then I will look at certifications that show experience. The certification tells me that this is somebody that I probably would be more open to speaking to, or at least gauging their interest level.”
– Erica Rivera, career coach and tech recruiter at Google
