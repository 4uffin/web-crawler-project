Permissions
Copyright permission is the authorization to make a photocopy of a purchased, clean copy of one of our products. Each copyright permission covers a single copy, so you need to purchase one (1) copyright permission for each copy of the item you intend to distribute. Copyright permission is only the authorization to make a photocopy and does not include a master copy from which to make the photocopy. If you already have a copy of the item and only need to purchase copyright permissions, on the product detail page, increase the quantity for Copyright Permission to the number you need to distribute, lower the quantity of the PDF to zero (0) and click the red ‘Add To Cart’ button and then ‘Check out’ on the resulting page.

Digital Materials And Course Planning
HBP is pleased to offer its content for higher education use in a variety of ways, including a Course Planning system, which allows faculty to plan and organize HBP materials by course, with several delivery options. Learn more: https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/pages/home/
Except for these options, we prohibit the posting of cases, articles, or chapters on “e-reserve” course pages for student access, as well as in “electronic coursepacks” that link to our digitized content and content postings on course management systems such as WebCT or Blackboard. Such unauthorized postings are equivalent to distributing our copyrighted content to students without permission, which infringes that copyright. This is so even if the content is being used for the first time and is password-protected, accessible only to students in the course, and taken down at the end of the course.
