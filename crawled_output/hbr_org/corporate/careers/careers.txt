Even More Than You Expect
Harvard Business Publishing influences real-world change through the reach and impact of its essential offering — ideas. We are committed to our mission to improve the practice of management in a changing world. We help lead, inform, and inspire professionals, corporations, educators, and students around the world with the best in management thinking and practice. Through our books, articles, case studies, videos, learning programs, and digital tools we reach thousands of organizations and millions of subscribers and social media followers.
Learn more about our mission and our market groups
Our culture is anchored in high standards, integrity, and respect for all — in keeping with our connection with Harvard. Working at Harvard Business Publishing brings you into a global, dynamic organization that’s constantly discovering — new markets, new technologies and media platforms, and new groundbreaking ideas. You’ll find your co-workers intellectually curious and highly engaged. We collaborate. We experiment. We are always learning.
Working at Harvard Business Publishing
Be Inspired Every Day
Our employees have unlimited access to the ideas we publish.  You might work directly with a best-selling author as they shape their next big idea, partner with a top brand to pilot a leadership development program or sit in on a case discussion with a renowned Harvard Business School professor. Harvard Business Publishing is a vibrant and exciting place to be.
Speak Your Mind
Don’t be surprised if you find yourself sharing ideas with senior management in the café or being asked for your opinion on new learning or technology trends in the market. See something you think we could do better? Jump right in. No matter what your role or level, you’ll contribute in a meaningful way.
Discover Through Collaboration
We are a company of diverse thinkers and see collaboration and honest dialogue as a powerful lever for shaping business priorities. Whether we’re discussing the implications of a provocative HBR article or joining a cross-functional team to generate new product ideas, open conversation advances all our work.
Explore New Technology
As early adopters of everything from social media to Agile development, we continually test new tools, platforms, and apps. Today you’ll find teams studying how gaming informs learning design, experimenting with storytelling formats on Snapchat, and testing products with Fortune 500 clients.
Power Your Career
Employees have the chance to build an incredible network across Harvard Business Publishing and the Harvard Community — from authors and professors to clients from well-known brands around the globe. You’ll learn from the diverse expertise of your peers and continually develop new skills through formal development, special assignments, and on-the-job learning and coaching.
Enjoy Life — with Purpose
Most companies have snacks and parties, and we do, too. We’re also thoughtful about the full experience we offer our employees. Our health and wellness benefits are some of the most comprehensive you’ll find anywhere. We offer meaningful programs that make lives better — like green initiatives, flexible work, paid volunteer days, and Summer Fridays. Plus, free pie every Thanksgiving.
