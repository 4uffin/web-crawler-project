HansenFrom the Magazine (July–August 2011)PostPostShareSaveBuy CopiesPrintSummary.   Leer en españolLer em portuguêsPostPostShareSaveBuy CopiesPrintWatching his employees use a new social technology, Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce.com, had an epiphany. His company had developed Chatter, a Facebook inspired application for companies that allows users to keep track of their colleagues and customers and share information and ideas.

As Benioff read the Chatter posts, he realized that many of the people who had critical customer knowledge and were adding the most value were not even known to the management team.A version of this article appeared in the July–August 2011 issue of Harvard Business Review.HIHerminia Ibarra
