Why Startups Benefit When Big Investments Come Later
Entrepreneurship Magazine Article
When startups receive funding can have as big an impact on innovation as how much funding they get, according to researchers Harsh Ketkar of the University of Texas at Austin and Maria Roche of Harvard Business School. Using data from the market research firm PitchBook and the data analytics company BuiltWith, they recorded data on 11,853 U.S. tech companies founded from 2010 to 2019. They identified when each company’s earliest funding arrived and how big the round was, then analyzed how those factors influenced subsequent innovation.
They concluded that the later startups receive their first round of funding, the more likely they are to keep experimenting after the money arrives; startups that receive a bigger investment use more technologies after cashing the check but combine them in less unusual ways, signaling reduced experimentation; and the investors’ track records affect how much companies continue experimenting after launch, and the timing and size of the first investment can impact how long a startup survives.

The CEO of Save the Children U.S. on Navigating a Sudden Funding Crisis
Crisis management Magazine Article Janti Soeripto
For almost a century, Save the Children U.S. has tackled the challenge of aiding impoverished children and families in America and raising funds for global programs. But when the Trump administration announced a freeze on all U.S. foreign development assistance, the organization faced another challenge—not just saving children but saving its own programs.
Janti Soeripto, CEO of Save the Children U.S., describes how her team moved “through every stage of grief”—before swiftly pivoting to respond to the crisis, focusing on transparency, communication, and outreach as they learned “to manage our cash flow the way a scrappy business might.” Their efforts at rebound have led to examination of how they can reform and innovate to even better serve children in desperate need.
Leaders facing similar challenges can learn from Save the Children’s resilience. Soeripto advises developing a few key organizational strengths: radical acceptance, flexibility, focus, decisiveness, and vision. Navigating crisis response and then looking beyond it to rebound and reform can give you a positive, proactive mindset and direction.

Now Is the Time for Courage
Leadership Magazine Article Ranjay Gulati
Research has shown that fortune favors the bold, not the cautious. But in volatile and uncertain times, many leaders hesitate to act, and others simply freeze up. The question is, Can bravery be acquired? In this article an HBS professor who has done extensive research on the subject argues that everyone can—and should—learn to be courageous.
Risk management helps tamp down fear, of course, but it isn’t enough. By studying daring CEOs like BlackRock’s Larry Fink and PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, gutsy whistleblowers like Frances Haugen of Facebook, and everyday heroes like the Taj hotel employees who helped guests survive a 2008 terrorist attack, the author uncovered five specific strategies used by people who demonstrate bravery: (1) They create positive narratives that guide them through chaos, often recasting their work as a moral quest. (2) They build their confidence through training and preparation, by expanding their arsenal of mental tools, and by focusing on what they can control. (3) They size up complex and ambiguous situations step-by-step, adjusting course as their understanding grows. (4) They enlist the help of allies, mentors, and critics. And finally, (5) they help themselves stay calm by practicing self-care, embracing rituals, and reframing situations more positively.

How Digital Integration Is Reconfiguring Value Chains
Operations and supply chain management Magazine Article Antonio Moreno
While companies have been “unbundling” their operations and outsourcing tasks for decades, advances in IT are now helping them take that strategy to a whole new level. These technologies make it possible to digitally integrate workflows across organizations, letting firms easily distribute complex chains of activities among multiple entities, including customers. They not only slash collaboration costs but give all players instant access to capabilities that only large firms could once afford. Consider logistics, where thanks to cloud-based services like ShipBob, small brands can fulfill orders just as quickly as retail giants can.
In traditional outsourcing, businesses just handed off tasks, but now they’re embedding third-party services into their own operations. This development has given rise to a multitude of hyperspecialized services that firms can tap. It has also inspired the emergence of “orchestrators” that coordinate all the tasks needed to create and deliver offerings. Hyperspecialists and orchestrators offer firms new opportunities to monetize assets, grow revenues, and create markets. But they’re also blurring industry boundaries, and some have started competing directly with their clients.

Addressing Gen AI’s Quality-Control Problem
Technology and analytics Magazine Article Stefan ThomkePhilipp EisenhauerPuneet Sahni
For all the enthusiasm around generative AI, a hurdle is limiting its adoption: the technology’s tendency to make things up, leave things out, and create so many possibilities that it is hard to figure out which will be effective. That’s why the vast majority of companies employ human reviews and stand-alone testing tools, but these quality-control methods are expensive, and they can handle only a fraction of gen AI’s total output. Amazon has developed a better approach for its massive product ­catalog operation: a gen AI–based system named Catalog AI that can automatically detect and block unreliable data, produce ideas for new product pages and test their effectiveness, and improve itself with feedback from quality checks and experiments.
In this article Harvard Business School’s Stefan Thomke and Amazon’s Philipp Eisenhauer and Puneet Sahni describe Amazon’s system for performing quality control on AI-generated content at scale. Although Amazon considers Catalog AI to be a work in progress, the authors believe that it is far enough along that managers at other organizations can benefit from learning about it now.

Every Team Needs a Super-Facilitator
Collaboration and teams Magazine Article Jamil Zaki
Most of us have met super-facilitators—people with a talent for bringing individual group members together, combining each one’s unique strengths to promote optimal team performance. Super-facilitators integrate diverse expertise, promote equitable contributions, and cultivate trust among teammates, generating collective intelligence—a group’s ability to solve problems together.
In this article Stanford psychologist Jamil Zaki surveys new research, presenting key findings about super-facilitators, collective intelligence, and team performance. Showcasing NBA star Chris Paul, Zaki describes how super-facilitators develop successful group collaboration through attunement, using perception and empathy to promote team performance; communication, through mentoring younger teammates and expressing belief in colleagues’ capabilities; and distribution, ensuring that everyone contributes.
Fortunately, Zaki adds, super-facilitating is not just a trait but a skill that can be honed. He offers a playbook for emulating these principles, including tactics such as learning and playing to each person’s strengths, communicating your belief in others, and including everyone during discussions. With these practices, anyone can harness the power of individual strengths to create a high performing team.

How Savvy Companies Are Using Chinese AI
Technology and analytics Magazine Article Amit JoshiMark J. GreevenSophie LiuKunjian Li
Many global companies are integrating gen AI into their businesses, and most are using Western tools from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. But they now find themselves navigating a second, very different ecosystem, one that has grown rapidly, quietly, and with a logic all its own: Chinese companies have developed a unique and competitive gen AI infrastructure that differs significantly from Western systems.
This article presents a framework to help leaders at global firms understand China’s unique gen AI architecture. Three pillars—customization in infrastructure, cost leadership in model development, and calibration for real-world applications—set China’s gen AI apart from the West’s.
The authors contend that we’re entering an era when no single gen AI stack or tool will dominate. Rather, companies will need to strategically integrate Chinese and Western AI solutions. They offer a road map for adopting a dual track approach to achieve superior strategic outcomes and operational efficiency. This isn’t about East versus West, the authors write. It’s about designing strategies that work in a world with more than one AI future.

The Founder’s Final Act
Entrepreneurship Magazine Article Josh BaronBen FrancoisTony GuidottiNien-hê Hsieh
As they approach retirement, company founders face a critical choice: Who will own their business next? That decision will reverberate for years, affecting not only them and their family but all the people whose lives are touched by the company. Though it can cement or undo an entrepreneur’s legacy, many owners postpone or avoid making it. And down the road that can lead to enormous tax consequences, family infighting, and instability that disrupts or destroys the business.
This article describes a structured process entrepreneurs can follow to choose the owner who will come after them, drawing on the experiences of the founders of Patagonia, John Lewis, Vanguard, Rolex, and more. The first step is to think about the outcomes you want for you, your family, your employees, your business partners, and your community and prioritize them. Next comes exploring the potential options: passing the business down to family members; taking it public or selling it to investors; turning it over to your employees or customers; or donating it to charity. These choices each have strengths and weaknesses, so you need to examine how they align with your priorities. Eventually you’ll have to pull the trigger, but first you should draft a detailed plan that you can adjust as needed.

Choose the Right CEO for Volatile Times
Boards Magazine Article Claudius A. HildebrandKate HurleyGiovanna Galli
In an increasingly unpredictable world, boards often struggle to plan CEO successions. Many don’t want to change captains midstorm, and many play it “safe” by hiring the most experienced candidate they can—and keeping their outgoing CEO around in other capacities. But those approaches can be risky and counterproductive, say three consultants whose team at Spencer Stuart has extensively studied CEO transitions across major U.S. and European stock indexes.
What matters most in CEOs today is not the depth but the range of their experience, particularly with organizational change, failure, and recovery. If boards hire someone unfamiliar with those challenges, they expose companies to three risk factors that can erode their competitiveness: rigid playbooks, cultural calcification, and shorter tenures. In this article, the authors explain why those factors are so problematic and describe how organizations today can transform the moment of CEO selection into a moment of strategic advantage by balancing risk and reward, practicing “always on” succession planning, and revising their selection criteria.

It’s Time to Try Bundled Pricing
Sales and marketing Magazine Article Rafi Mohammed
During an era of high inflation, many companies raise prices repeatedly, which risks alienating customers. Bundled pricing can be a powerful alternative strategy. Consider Chili’s “3 For Me” success: The restaurant chain reversed years of stagnation by offering meals at set prices, driving a 31% sales increase and record-high stock performance.
The appeal of bundling lies not just in perceived value but also in simplified choices, lowered operational costs, and stronger customer relationships.
Many executives misperceive bundling as a discounting tactic. But not all bundles are cheaper—some add value through convenience, exclusive perks, or customer experience enhancements. Case studies in a range of industries—fast food, insurance, entertainment, professional sports—demonstrate how both discount and premium bundles can drive top-line growth or bolster margins, depending on the strategy.
Companies must consider customer preferences, product complementarity, and organizational goals when designing bundles. This article offers a practical framework to determine whether to lead with discounts, value-adds, or both—and encourages firms to find their unique “gasoline” that will propel the bundle’s appeal and profitability.

How to Counter Fake News
Business and society Magazine Article Michael EtterPatrick HaackSimone MaricondaMarta Pizzetti
Fake news—deliberately fabricated stories designed to go viral—poses escalating risks to corporate reputations. Traditional responses, such as ignoring false claims or issuing corrections, often fail. So what should companies do?
Drawing on behavioral research and real-world case studies, the authors present a three-part framework: monitor social resonance to identify the spread and influencers of fake news early; ensure transparency by engaging stakeholders before crises erupt; and activate credible allies to reinforce the truth. A fictional case illustrates how these tactics can shift the narrative and maintain trust.
In this age of disinformation, defense against fake news requires more than truth-telling—it demands building and broadcasting the perception that others also reject the falsehoods.

Why You Need Systems Thinking Now
Innovation Magazine Article Tima BansalJulian Birkinshaw
Traditional innovation approaches—breakthrough and design thinking—often ignore the complex ripple effects they produce in interconnected systems. In a world facing multifaceted challenges like climate change and sustainability, a systems-thinking approach offers a more resilient and holistic path forward.
Systems thinking emphasizes understanding interdependencies, redefining problems iteratively, and engaging diverse stakeholders to co-create solutions. This article outlines a four-step framework: (1) Define a desired future state. (2) Reframe problems so that they resonate across stakeholders. (3) Focus on flows and relationships over discrete products. And (4) implement small nudges to gradually shift the system. Examples from Maple Leaf Foods, Co-operators Insurance, and the CSA Group illustrate how this approach can realign business models for long-term sustainability.
While not a replacement for other innovation methods, systems thinking addresses their limitations in tackling “wicked problems.” It encourages companies to anticipate unintended consequences, build coalitions, and adaptively guide transformation in complex environments.

Why Aren’t I Better at Delegating?
Managing yourself Magazine Article Elsbeth Johnson
All leaders—from new managers to seasoned executives—must delegate tasks to free up time and attention for the big-picture work their more-senior roles demand. But too often leaders find themselves caught in the weeds of execution.
This article helps leaders determine which work to keep and which is better left to a team member. Then it identifies four challenges that stop even those who know how to delegate from doing it successfully: (1) an addiction to the dopamine hit of easy productivity, (2) a disinclination to reject requests for help, (3) a desire to meet their own bosses’ or clients’ unmanaged expectations, and (4) a misunderstanding of what “work” should mean for a manager. Drawing on research and two decades of experience advising senior leaders, the author offers concrete recommendations for overcoming each challenge.
Even for leaders with the best of intentions, overcoming these challenges will take time. However, if you stick with it and learn to delegate effectively, you’ll get much more out of your team members—and yourself, as a developer of talent and as a big-picture, strategic thinker.

Case Study: A Fast-Food Company Considers Dynamic Pricing
Pricing strategy Magazine Article Elie Ofek
To respond to a volatile inflation crisis, should the CEO of Burger & Bites, a fictional fast-food chain, introduce dynamic pricing to its restaurants? The company’s input costs are increasing quickly since several of its ingredients come from other countries. Meanwhile, the CEO is facing intense pressure from investors to boost margins. Using its new digital menus and mobile app, the company could start adjusting prices in real time based on factors from inventory levels to regional demographics to weather. Consumers are used to dynamic pricing in air travel and hotels, but will they accept it at a fast-food restaurant?
Some franchisees and members of the leadership team are worried about backlash. Burger & Bites has a reputation for fairness, consistency, and community connection, so changing prices often could alienate customers and damage loyalty. In addition, it could lead to charges of discrimination if some groups are offered higher prices than others, potentially causing a social media–fueled scandal. The CEO isn’t sure how best to proceed.
