When a fashion influencer is photographed carrying a designer handbag, it can turn an obscure brand into a household name overnight. A single endorsement from an A-list celebrity, whether intentional or not, can generate millions in sales and reshape consumer demand. Brands meticulously court pop culture icons, sending them products, sponsoring their events, and vying for a moment of public recognition that could change their business forever. The logic is simple: people trust and follow the companies and brands that influential figures endorse, and in today’s media-driven world, credibility and attention is currency.MDMark DesJardine
