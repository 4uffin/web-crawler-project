Then I started listening to The Drive, a podcast hosted by Peter Attia, who trained as a surgeon, then became a McKinsey consultant, and now runs a concierge medical practice focused on “healthspan”—a term he’s helped to popularize. Unlike lifespan, which is how long you live, healthspan refers to how long you’ll enjoy an active, disease-free lifestyle, and on his podcast, Attia interviews experts about the best ways to do that. He talks frequently about Lp(a), which is rarely included in routine bloodwork but can indicate your inherited risk for heart disease. So after bingeing The Drive, I asked my doctor to measure mine: 307 nanomoles per liter, compared to a normal value of under 75. Yikes. I now see a cardiologist regularly.A version of this article appeared in the September–October 2025 issue of Harvard Business Review.Daniel McGinn
