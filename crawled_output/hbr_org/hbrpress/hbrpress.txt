What our authors say
“The publicity department, both in the US and abroad, was unparallelled in getting the book into the
right hands, which allowed me to influence policymakers at the highest level. Any author would be lucky
to work with HBR’s team.”
Joan C. Williams, author of White Working Class: Overcoming Class Cluelessness in
America
“I’ve published books with many great publishers, but HBR Press is in a league of its own when it comes
to promoting its authors and reaching the widest and most relevant audience. What you will
experience...is an incredibly talented team that looks after each author like a true asset.”
Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, author of Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become
Leaders?
“HBR Press is the gold standard in book publishing. From my New York Times
bestseller Reverse Innovation to my latest book
The Three-Box Solution—the time and attention given to
me by my editor was undoubtedly the key to each book’s success. Publishing with HBR is a true
partnership.”
Vijay Govindarajan, Coxe Distinguished Professor at Tuck at Dartmouth College and Former
Marvin Bower Fellow at Harvard Business School
