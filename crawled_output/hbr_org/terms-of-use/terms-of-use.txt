Harvard Business Publishing Terms of Use
BY ACCESSING THIS WEBSITE AND/OR ANY CONTENT ON THIS WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE (“TERMS”). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING HBP/HBR WEBSITES, AS THESE TERMS AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. THE WAIVER AFFECTS HOW DISPUTES WITH HBP ARE RESOLVED. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
ACCEPTANCE
These Terms govern your use of the Harvard Business Publishing (“HBP”) products or services, including following websites: www.harvardbusiness.org; www.hbr.org; https://hbsp.harvard.edu and mobile applications (the “Sites”). By using the Sites, you agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by these Terms and the relevant Site’s Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you may not use the Sites.
HBP may revise these Terms at any time. Your continued usage of these Sites will mean you accept those changes, and you agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The materials provided on these Sites are protected by law, including, but not limited to, the United States copyright laws and international treaties.
The terms “you,” “your,” “user,” and “users,” as used herein, refer to all individuals and/or entities accessing these Sites for any reason.
ELIGIBILITY
Users must be 18 years of age or older to visit or use the Sites in any manner. By visiting the Sites or accepting these Terms, you represent and warrant to HBP that you are 18 years of age or older, and that you have the right, authority, and capacity to agree to and abide by these Terms. You also represent and warrant to HBP that you will use the Sites in a manner consistent with any and all applicable laws and regulations.
Users under the age of 18 must have the consent of a parent or guardian to enter the Sites.  All references to “you” in these Terms of Use shall encompass and hold legally liable the parent or guardian of anyone under the age of 18.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND LICENSE
The design and content on these Sites, such as text, graphics, images, photographs, illustrations, trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, information and other materials (collectively “Contents”) is the intellectual property of HBP or its licensors and is protected under both United States and foreign laws. Any use of the Contents not expressly permitted by these Terms will be viewed by HBP as a contractual breach of these Terms and may also violate copyright, trademark, and other laws.
Except as expressly stated herein, none of the Contents may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means without the prior written permission of HBP or its licensors.
HBP hereby grants you a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Contents available on the Sites solely for your personal, non-commercial use.
You may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Contents or Sites, or any part thereof. These Terms will govern any upgrades provided by HBP that replace and/or supplement the original Sites, unless such upgrade is accompanied by separate or updated Terms. If you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the Contents automatically terminates. Any continued use of the Contents after termination will be viewed by HBP as willful infringement of its intellectual property.
None of the Contents may be accessed or used by or with artificial intelligence tools or models for the purposes of generating text, images or any other material, output or derivative works based on or using the Contents.
You may not bypass, modify, defeat, tamper with or circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Sites or Contents.
You may not, without HBP’s prior written permission, “mirror” any Contents contained in these Sites on any other server. You may not use the Sites for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. You may not use the Sites in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Sites, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of the Sites. You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Sites through hacking, password mining, or disabling rights management mechanisms, or any other means. HBP reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Sites, or any portion thereof, at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all, without prior notice or any notice.
SOFTWARE LICENSE
HBP hereby grants you a limited, revocable, and non-transferable license to use the HBP mobile applications (“App”) on devices you own or have a legal right to use in accordance with these Terms and any additional terms specific to that particular application.  In the event of a conflict between such additional terms for the particular application and these Terms, the HBP Terms will prevail. You have no rights to the proprietary software and related documentation, or any enhancements or modifications thereto, provided to you in order to access the App. You may not sublicense, assign or transfer any licenses granted by HBP, and any attempt at such sublicense, assignment or transfer will be null and void. You may make one copy of such App for archival purposes only. You may not otherwise copy, distribute, modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from the App.
ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR APPLE PRODUCT USERS. IF YOU ACCESS OR DOWNLOAD THE HBR APP FROM THE APPLE APP STORE:
You acknowledge and agree that the Terms are concluded between you and HBP only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the licensed application (“HBR App”) and the contents thereof;
The HBR App is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable basis for use on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Service Terms and Conditions, except that the HBR App may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with you via Family Sharing or volume purchasing;
You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the HBR App;
In the event of any failure of the HBR App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any) for the HBR App to you. Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the HBR App;
You acknowledge and agree that HBP, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any other claims you or any third party may have in relation to the HBR App;
You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third-party claim that the HBR App or your possession and use of the HBR App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, HBP, and not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim;
You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;
Both you and HBP acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the HBR App, you will comply with any applicable third-party terms of agreement; and
Both you and HBP acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary of the Terms.

MANDATORY AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, counts, claim, or cause of action) between you and HBP or HBP’s employees, agents, successors, or assigns, shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration, except that You or HBP may take claims to small claims court if the dispute qualifies for hearing by such a court.
