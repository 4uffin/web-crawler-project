What’s included in the HBR app?
The HBR app contains the full archive of articles from Harvard Business review. Your HBR.org subscription includes access to the app and you can use your website login to sign in. Subscribers who purchase a subscription from the Apple App Store or Google Play will also get website access included in their subscription.
The HBR app has been fully redesigned and includes options to follow topics, read the Management Tip of the Day, and stay up to date on the latest articles published on HBR.org and in the magazine. On the new app, you can also listen to audio articles and HBR Podcast episodes and browse the archive of magazine issues.
How do I access the HBR app?
You can download the Harvard Business Review app from the Apple App Store or from the Google Play Store. Just search “Harvard Business Review” and look for this app:
I purchased a subscription to the previous HBR app on my phone. How do I access my in-app subscription?
You will be able to restore your subscription purchase when you install the new HBR app.
Go to Profile on the app and choose Sign In.
Enter your email address and password.
You will be taken to a screen to Update Account: this is the first step to restoring your subscription.
When you submit your account info, you’ll see a page outlining what’s included in your HBR app subscription and a button to Restore Purchase.
If you have an active paid subscription, clicking the Restore Purchase button will restore access to your subscription.
If the Apple App Store or Google Play does not successfully restore your in-app subscription, you can contact their support channels.
If you didn’t have a paid subscription to the previous app, there will be no subscription available to you to restore. You can continue using the app as a free user or return to Profile on the app and choose to Subscribe.
Are my saved items from the previous HBR app still available in my Library?
We were not able to move saved items from the previous app into the new HBR app for those subscribers who purchased their subscription on their phone. However, now that in-app subscription includes access to the website, any items you save on the web or on the app will be available in both locations. Additionally, the new HBR app gives you an option to see your Recently Viewed articles from your Library so it’s easy to pick up where you left off.
Subscribers who purchased their subscription on the website will see that their saved items are available in the app Library, but their folders are not yet available; we will be bringing that functionality into the app soon.
I’m an HBR Premium subscriber. How do I get my quarterly e-book?
HBR Premium and HBR Executive subscribers are entitled to four complimentary e-books per calendar year. Each quarter, Premium and Executive subscribers are given the choice of four titles from which to select one e-book, redeemable for free with a promo code in the HBR store. The steps for redeeming a Premium quarterly e-book are:
Choose one e-book from the four titles offered in the email you will receive from Harvard Business Review each quarter.
You will be directed to your chosen e-book’s page on the HBR store (Note: Make sure you are logged into the HBR store with your Premium or Executive HBR subscriber account credentials). Click Add to Cart and then Checkout.
On the checkout page, include the promo code offered in your email in the promo code field. The grand total will now show $0.
Click Checkout.
Your complimentary e-book will be delivered to your Orders tab in My Library.
