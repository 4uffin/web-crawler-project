If you are using age instead of GPG for encryption purposes, I've found this to be useful: https://github.com/FiloSottile/passagereplysgsjchs 29 minutes ago

Why would you want to store arbitrary individual passwords instead of deriving them with on demand from the service name/domain and a common secret?replysnailmailman 26 minutes ago

If you are doing that,- what if some site has weird password requirements and the derived password doesn’t work- what if a site gets hacked and you need to rotate one password.If you have to store data per-site anyway because of those cases, may as well just store passwords. You can (and should) still generate extremely high entropy passwords.replymerlincorey 24 minutes ago

Additionally, you can store other data for example one could have scans of important documents that are stored in Pass which means they are GPG encrypted and backed by a git repository so they are versioned and shared across multiple machines.replyakerl_ 25 minutes ago

Because the former works with any site and circumstance and the latter does not.replyobk0943t 23 minutes ago

There is still no just-download clients for pass on mobile which I think is why it's not a good optionreplycramsession 3 minutes ago
