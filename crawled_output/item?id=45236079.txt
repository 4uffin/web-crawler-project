Browser password managers with passkeys are more convenient for me, but a pass vault can still be useful for recovery codes and API keys.I used pass for a while but couldn’t see what threat model it actually solves:If you let GPG agent cache your key, any script (e.g. an npm post-install) can just run `pass ls` or `pass my/secrets` and dump all your credentials. At that point it’s basically just full-disk encryption with extra steps—might as well keep everything in ~/passwords.txt.If you don’t cache the key, you’re forced to type your long GPG password every single time you need a secret.I tried a YubiKey for on-demand unlocking, but the integration is clunky and plugging it in constantly is a pain if you need passwords multiple times per hour.I eventually switched to Bitwarden.replyaborsy 29 minutes ago

That’s true for any password manager. If the database/store is unlocked (so the master password is cached or available in RAM), all passwords can be extracted. You have to lock the password manager when you don’t need it.In fact, with Bitwarden, the cached password is exposed to the browser that has a large attack surface (including interacting with random remote servers). There was just a vulnerability in most browser based password managers including Bitwarden that would allow a remote attacker trick a user send out their passwords.I use Bitwarden but mostly for non-critical passwords.replyjustusthane 52 minutes ago

> a pass vault can still be useful for recovery codes and API keysYou might already be aware of this, but Bitwarden also has a CLI client that can be used for this purpose, at least casually.replyggiesen 20 minutes ago

This is interesting for CLI lovers, but I feel KeepassXC on desktop + KeepassDX on Android (with the password DB stored on my own machine and accessed remotely via Wireguard) is a better solution for normies.replyhyperpl 2 hours ago

Any particular reason for remote access via wg and not via syncthing? I'm also curious how you access it via wg on Android?replyelevation 2 hours ago
| parent | prev | next [–]
Don't forget keepassxc.cli, which allows you to programmatically set and retrieve secrets.
The interface is significantly more user friendly arcane.
I used it when I needed to build an encrypted secrets bundle (so that one long password could temporarily unlock some API keys required for a disaster-recovery situation.)
I was able to generate a single file plus a "Makefile" to unlock it and pass the keys into the appropriate environments.I had attempted to use GNU `pass' first, but sadly, it requires me to manage gnupg, which is a well known minefield of poor default options, and assumes it should be integrated into your shell by storing things in your user profile directory (instead of using the directory relative to where you call it.)
This jeopardized my copy-one-file workflow, so despite its ubiquity I had to abandon it.replylucb1e 2 hours ago

This is fun if you never leave yourself, but be wary with whom you share it. As a company password manager, there is no way to know who's accessed which secret across their lifetime at the firm so you get to change all the passwords constantly. (Or none, if you can't be bothered.) (Don't ask.)Or if someone newly needs access, there's no standard way of re-encrypting the files you're guessing they need. You need to hack something together yourselfIt uses git, but the commit messages are autogenerated and useless. It might as well have used Dropbox for all the use you get out of it when wanting to find the version before someone corrupted data with their somehow-broken gopass clientThere is no way to ever erase anything you've accidentally pushed, short of rewriting the git history and breaking it for everyone (or for personal use: other client devices)It looks nice and simple, and I like that I can interface with it with manual tools (e.g. write my own commit messages to have some idea of wtf is going on, e.g. when mass-reencrypting to not have 300 commits), but the simplicity is also the pitfall. Feels a bit similar to using hash(site_name+main_password) as a per-site password: beautiful in simplicity but various practical issuesDoes anyone have good experiences with a password manager for a corporate environment? Ideally not having yet-another service to maintain, but also not have a server compromise equal business compromise (so end-to-end encryption between the users; verifying fingerprints or some such). From what I found so far, Bitwarden seems to meet that bill but I don't know if there are also othersreplyggiesen 18 minutes ago

Bitwarden is pretty usable, we use it at our org, and while still has a rough edge or two for corporate use, gets better all the time.replysupriyo-biswas 2 hours ago

How do you have 1300 passwords? Sounds like a lot. Come to think of it though, I have no idea how many I have.replymjd 2 hours ago

I've been doing basically this for many years now.Each password file is AES-encrypted with my master password.I copy the whole vault around between machines with rsync.When I run 'password bank' a shell script searches ~/private/Passwords for files that contain ‘bank’ and offers a menu, then gpg-decrypts the file I selected.I also use this for scans of my passport, recording my bank account numbers, and anything else I want to keep around.I thought I was the only one, and now I've found out there are thousands of us!replymsravi 2 hours ago

I used pass for many years and loved it. I sync'd my password store between 3+ devices including my Android phone using a git remote. I don't recall the exact reason - maybe the pass android client I had used for years went away? I decided to find the next best option and settled on keepassxc and KeePassDX. The backing store is a binary blob but it does surprisingly well via syncthing: autoupdate works and in the event of a conflict the db merge feature hasn't yet failed me.Granted on the desktop I find using a (qt especially) GUI more invasive than a terminal but at least on the Android side the app is quite good.replyWD-42 2 hours ago

Pass is still amazing after all these years. Shameless self plug: I wrote a gnome search provider for it so you can lookup passwords from the overview. Supports OTP as well. https://github.com/Fingel/ripasso-gnome-search-providerreplyaborsy 1 hour ago

I have heavily used Pass over the years. Here are some of its pros (an update to my comment several years ago):* Your secret key can be stored in Yubikey, handled by a dedicated OpenPGP agent. This allows deriving a strong key from a weak one. Your password is basically a short PIN with max 3 tries. Every password retrieval can require a physical touch. This is convenient and secure!Pass makes sense if you use it with a hardware key, with touch enabled. With this setup, it’s hard to beat its security.* It uses public key cryptography, and comes with its advantages. You don’t need your master password to add/encrypt passwords. You only need that for decryption. Less exposure of master key, and more convenience.For that reason, it’s well suited to share passwords with other people or devices. You can encrypt to multiple public keys. This adds multi user and device support.You can easily add a backup offline public key (which you may print) if you lose your Yubikey.* You can decrypt a single password without decrypting and exposing other passwords. The passwords are isolated, if you use Yubikey.* Searching passwords is quick and transparent. You easily see what is in your store.* You can use it programmatically, eg, your backup script can grab a password from the store.* It’s a short bash script that you can verify, and delegates encryption to a dedicated well-audited cryptographic tool.* PGP is a standard, and GPG and git are widely available. There is no database to break or migrate. You can read your passwords anywhere and in the future.* The script is written by the creator of the acclaimed Wireguard!There are also cons.* Some people don’t like that it leaks metadata (filenames, and password tree), though there are versions of pass that fix it.* Lately gpg is causing some troubles with Debian Trixie. GPG agent frequently locks the Yubikey and requires restarting pcscd (probably due to conflicts with pcscd).
There is a similar tool Passage using Age, maybe that solves it.* There are mobile apps, but they are not as frequently updated as something like Bitwarden apps (which has client for every OS, and frequently fixes bugs and adds functionality).* I haven’t used and not sure how good browser support is.Here is a post on a similar password management with GPG replaced with Agehttps://words.filippo.io/passage/replyhazek112 1 hour ago

Any recs for yubikey setup guides with pass?replyaborsy 35 minutes ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Nothing specific to pass. It’s just Yubikey setup with GPG; that’s part of the appeal!https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-GuideThis guide covers many
adjacent topics; the relevant
part is generating the secret key inside Yubikey, or in an airgapped system and
doing “key-to-card” in gpg.replyjwgarber 1 hour ago

Pass is great, but GPG keys are complicated and add a lot of extra overhead if you don't have one already. Frankly I cannot recommend anyone use GPG today for any purpose. I wrote a much simpler CLI password manager instead that meets explicit security models.https://codeberg.org/jwgarber/napa/src/branch/main/database....replytlamponi 2 hours ago

I like pass and use it a lot, especially as it provides a good and safe backup for the case my vaultwarden instance goes up in smokes.There is also a drop-in replacement with has some extra features and a bit better UX in some parts, personally I only really use it for the better support for handling multiple GPG keys, as I got some physical backup keys and it can be also nice teams for a shared vault.https://www.gopass.pw/https://github.com/gopasspw/gopassreplyawaymazdacx5 2 hours ago

Why would you want to store arbitrary individual passwords instead of deriving them with on demand from the service name/domain and a common secret?replysnailmailman 3 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
If you are doing that,- what if some site has weird password requirements and the derived password doesn’t work- what if a site gets hacked and you need to rotate one password.If you have to store data per-site anyway because of those cases, may as well just store passwords. You can (and should) still generate extremely high entropy passwords.replymerlincorey 3 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Additionally, you can store other data for example one could have scans of important documents that are stored in Pass which means they are GPG encrypted and backed by a git repository so they are versioned and shared across multiple machines.replylucb1e 2 hours ago
| root | parent | prev | next [–]
indeed. Additionally:- if your secret leaks and you don't know it (or you do know, but you need some time to change it), the attacker not only gets the snapshot of your password manager but also can derive all future passwords you'll generate, or past ones you long forgot about- there's no way to know what you've entered before, since it's stateless. With data stored in a manager, I know what username I used and can associate other data. If your uniqueifying input is the domain, and let's say HN would become hn.yc or whatever and you visit it again in ten years, you'd have to remember that hn.yc accepts the password of what you entered as news.ycombinator.comI have to admit though, hash(name+secret)=password is so simple and beautiful that it draws IT people like a fine artwork draws visitors. But for me, that doesn't outweigh the practical issuesreplyakerl_ 3 hours ago

Because the former works with any site and circumstance and the latter does not.replygmuslera 2 hours ago
| parent | prev | next [–]
Not all sites are safe, either by design or by people running them. Having a common secret+service name as password AND having at least one of those sites leaking your plaintext password could mean that your derivation may go public and all your other passwords and services fall because of that.replylisteria 1 hour ago
| root | parent | next [–]
presumably the derivation would involve a cryptographically secure, non-reversible function so as to not compromise the secret should one of them be leaked.replyedoceo 1 hour ago

What kind of mobile functionality were you looking for? The (unofficial) iOS app is pretty good IMHO and integrates with iOS’s OS-level password filling, and also supports the pass-otp plugin’s format for 2fa codes if you use that plugin.
