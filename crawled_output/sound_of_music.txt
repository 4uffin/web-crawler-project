A tuneful, heartwarming story, it is based on the real life story of the Von Trapp Family singers, one of the world's best-known concert groups in the era immediately preceding World War II. Julie Andrews plays the role of Maria, the tomboyish postulant at an Austrian abbey who becomes a governess in the home of a widowed naval captain with seven children, and brings a new love of life and music into the home.

The Sound of Music
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.

Whether you enjoy it as a fun family singalong or a moving true story, this classic still bounces along in a tremendously likeable fashion.

It is not a bold, adventuresome motion picture, nor does it advance the art of the film even a trifle. What it is, and this is what the producers must have intended, is tuneful, uncomplicated entertainment, expensively set before the viewer.

The last of the Rodgers-Hammer-stein collaborations, The Sound of Music is the best screen version of their works.

The movie hurts. It stings. Too many simply remember it as some happy-go-lucky singalong, but absolutely not. The Sound of Music breaks your heart.

The Sound of Music may be schmaltz, but it’s irresistible schmaltz.
Rated: 3.5/4

Of course, it's well done for what it is: that is to say, those who made it are experts at manipulating responses. They're the Pavlovs of moviemaking: they turn us into dogs that salivate on signal.
