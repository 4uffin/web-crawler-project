These are not part of the problem statements, although we tried our best to make sure that their behaviour correctly follows it. You can investigate examples or your own tests in more details with them. Note the following:
the visualizers use javascript in your browser to work; you don't need to install anything additional; we won't be able to help with the visualizers during the round. Picture of authors (and some testers) (and some non testers): We eagerly anticipate your participation!

In Problems Statements, Examples Are Now Highlighted if Test Cases Are Used
By¬†MikeMirzayanov,
history,
2 days ago,
Hi, Codeforces!Remember this post https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/105779 about highlighting test cases in example inputs?Well, with a quick push, Vladosiya and I have now added support for highlighting cases in the outputs as well. On hover (or tap on mobile), the corresponding input and output cases even get highlighted together. Look at this beauty:
There's still a bit of polishing needed for situations when authors add custom outputs or in some other unusual scenarios, but the basic functionality is already there and ready to use.Enjoy the upcoming rounds!

Codeforces Round 1050 (Div. 4)
By¬†cry,
12 days ago,
I am extremely delighted to invite you to participate in my first solo round, Codeforces Round 1050 (Div. 4), starting on Sep/13/2025 17:35 (Moscow time). There will be $$$7$$$ problems to be solved in $$$2$$$ hours and $$$15$$$ minutes. The format of the event will be identical to Div. 3 rounds:
ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission; 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points) after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests, and the ratings recalculated by default, only "trusted" participants are shown in the results table (but the rating will be recalculated for all with initial ratings less than 1400 or you are an unrated participant/newcomer). We urge participants whose rating is 1400+ not to register new accounts for the purpose of narcissism but to take part unofficially. Please do not spoil the contest for the official participants.Only trusted participants of the fourth division will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a trusted participant of the fourth division, you must:
take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them), do not have a point of 1400 or higher in the rating. Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the fourth division or not, if your rating is less than 1400 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), you may choose to participate rated or unrated.PLEASE NOTE the rule restricting AI use. If you are caught using AI in an unorthodox manner, either by us manually or detected automatically, YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE TERMINATED and your entire family will be sent to my basement (which has no toilets available). We will be actively scouring submissions and terminating rulebreakers.I would like to thank the following individuals for making this contest possible:
Myself for coordinating the round . Vladosiya for russian translations. reirugan for improving the statements. The following testuwuers: Proof_by_QED, reirugan, -firefly-, Filikec, LMeyling, mathtsai, __baozii__, Non-origination, chromate00, SpyrosAliv, Intellegent, Dominater069, Hori, RobinFromTheHood, poi, yse, Vladosiya, Lechaa, hashman, macaquedev, catgirl, kingbass, tin.le2, ByteRaider, litfan, AksLolCoding, expertaq, kwant, xorfftdp, minuki646, Hana05, .Habiba., apollo07, shuniko, Jteh, avighnakc, nifeshe, Edeeva, ChickenTamer, wuhudsm, and temporary1.

To find out the guidelines for proper AI use, what is allowed and what is prohibited, please read the post "Rule Restricting the use of AI". Improper use of AI tools during the main contest may result in disqualification. Using automatic translation tools (including but not limited to neural networks and AI) to convert code written in other programming languages to Kotlin goes against the spirit of the competition, so it is also strictly prohibited.

Hello, Codeforces!We are glad to invite you to participate in Codeforces Round 1048 (Div. 1) and Codeforces Round 1048 (Div. 2) on Sep/08/2025 17:35 (Moscow time).The round will be rated for everyone. You will be given 6 problems and 3 hours to solve them in both divisions. Some problems will be divided into subtasks.The problems were authored and prepared by installb, wjy666, tarjen, StarSilk and 2014CAIS01.We would like to thank:
maomao90 for his great coordination. Alexdat2000 for Russian translation. Um_nik, jqdai0815 and SSerxhs for red-black testing. A_G, -skyline- and __baozii__ for red testing. fishy15, oolimry, Boboge, nanani, Retired_shstyle and Tobo for orange testing. qsmcgogo and Zhi_Sheng for purple testing. goddddgg for blue testing. jellybean259 for green testing. akqxolotl for grey testing. MikeMirzayanov and KAN for the great platforms. The scoring distribution is below.
Div. 2: $$$ 500-1000-1500-2250-(2250+750)-3500 $$$ Div. 1: $$$ 500-1250-(1250+750)-2500-(2750+1500)-4250 $$$ Good luck to everyone! (=^ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•^=)UPDÔºöUnfortunately, it was discovered very lately (2 hours after the contest began) that the statement of div2D/div1B was missing an important condition. The correct statement should include the line "The operation 2 can only be applied at most once." The statement will be corrected soon.We believe this issue affected many participants of this round, and therefore we have to declare this round unrated. We sincerely apologize for this mistake.https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/146176 please refer to this blog for more information on why we decided to make the round unrated, and further elaborations on how this accident happened. We are deeply sorry for disappointing everyone, and we hope for your understanding.UPD2: Here's the editorial: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/146172
