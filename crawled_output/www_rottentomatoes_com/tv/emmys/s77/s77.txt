Eventually, the show found its natural level, as winners said what they needed to, or much of it, and the count dropped tens of thousands of dollars past zero.

Unfortunately, racing through the speeches came at too high a cost for the show itself, one that played out in uneven pacing and awkward moments strewn throughout.

For my part, I would’ve preferred a funny four-hour Emmys to a dull three-hour mock-telethon. But at least the Boys & Girls Clubs got something out of it.

There was a sense that for all of the ribbing, this Emmys broadcast was a pleasurable celebration of an ever-evolving medium.

TV Line
Sunday’s ceremony on CBS was all over the place, mixing genuinely inspiring moments with stilted comedy bits -- sometimes right next to each other. These Emmys were strangely anti-TV at times, with a self-deprecating tone that bordered on masochistic.
Rated: C

Either it was a pretty predictable celebration of television or Stephen Colbert’s audition tape or perhaps both, but the 77th Primetime Emmys on Sunday sure ended up giving off a lot of Saturday Night Live midseason episode vibes.
