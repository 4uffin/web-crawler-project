Robin Wright and Olivia Cooke are terrific at behaving badly in The Girlfriend, a twisty thriller that strains credulity with so much aplomb that audiences won't mind.

Wall Street Journal
Thanks to spontaneous mutual antagonism, neither mom nor girlfriend are happy. Viewers likely won’t be either.

"The Girlfriend” is exactly the kind of psychological and soapy binge to kick off the fall TV season, easily devoured in one indulgent sitting with a cheeky drink and lots of yelling at the screen.
Rated: B+

The Girlfriend is a brilliantly slippery beast.

The Establishing Shot
The series traffics in intellectual rigor and emotional nuance and this twisty drama plays like a cross between "Big Little Lies" and "Sleuth."
Rated: 4/4

The first episode shows enough promise, and makes viewers ask enough questions about both of its main characters, to keep us watching.

How and why do we form opinions of people the moment we meet? Extraordinarily juicy stuff perfect for bingeing, all eight eppies. Who will win?

Arya S
Entertaining drivel that, as usual, falls apart as main characters start making ridiculous choices. The main leads are appealing and well cast as it’s hard to determine which one is more crazy. The sound track is non- stop annoying and loud, with lyrics that impose meaning and distract from any original thoughts you may have while watching.

Hersha S
Wow! This one was quite the psychothriller. You've got two women upping the ante and trying to outdo the other, neither one willing to give in. I haven't seen a good thriller like this one in a while.

The first three episodes were fine, but then it went downhill and completely fell apart in the finale. I haven’t read the book yet, though I already knew the original ending, which makes more sense to me. It seems the writers wanted something less formulaic and tried to add a few dramatic (underwhelming at best) tweaks to avoid clichés, but those changes didn’t work.
