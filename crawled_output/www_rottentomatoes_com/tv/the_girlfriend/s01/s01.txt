Wall Street Journal
Thanks to spontaneous mutual antagonism, neither mom nor girlfriend are happy. Viewers likely won’t be either.

"The Girlfriend” is exactly the kind of psychological and soapy binge to kick off the fall TV season, easily devoured in one indulgent sitting with a cheeky drink and lots of yelling at the screen.
Rated: B+

The Girlfriend is a brilliantly slippery beast.

Its radical ending confirms that melodramas, far from being a minor genre, can be a laboratory where excess does not destroy reflection, but rather amplifies it to the point of absurdity. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 7/10

The Establishing Shot
The series traffics in intellectual rigor and emotional nuance and this twisty drama plays like a cross between "Big Little Lies" and "Sleuth."
Rated: 4/4

The first episode shows enough promise, and makes viewers ask enough questions about both of its main characters, to keep us watching.

The story is good, jumps right into the drama, is actually a good thriller, and the acting is great. Overall it is a great show. Something is wrong with the sound. Thought it was my TV or something else but the sound has been off on my devices as well. Hope they fix it.
