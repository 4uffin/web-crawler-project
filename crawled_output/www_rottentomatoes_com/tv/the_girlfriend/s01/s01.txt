Critics Consensus
Robin Wright and Olivia Cooke are terrific at behaving badly in The Girlfriend, a twisty thriller that strains credulity with so much aplomb that audiences won't mind.

The Age (Australia)
This limited series gets to some crazy places after a warm-up of dinner-table sniping and sexual control, but the implausibility doesn’t lessen the enjoyment.
Rated: 3.5/5

Girlfriend is hardly high art, but it is an outright gas.

The Times (UK)
And while there’s a smattering of class commentary and occasional attempts at deeper meaning, this is a drama that should be enjoyed for what is: a rollercoaster of fun and games.
Rated: 4/5

...The Girlfriend
doesn't invent anything new, nor does it aim to be relevant in its themes; it's simply entertaining, and that's all it is. [Full review in Spanish]

Its radical ending confirms that melodramas, far from being a minor genre, can be a laboratory where excess does not destroy reflection, but rather amplifies it to the point of absurdity. [Full review in Spanish]

Loved this one. Great performances, tantalizing plot, and a creative approach. Love some of the wicked humor too. Definitely recommend for a soapy miniseries

I really enjoyed this! I loved the way Wright and Hardin flipped between POVs and showed the value in perception- the way that our brains can interpret the same interaction so differently. And better yet, having the ability to make us empathize with both of them.
The soundtrack and selection of application for music was insanely good. It felt like some of the musical excerpts were made specifically for those scenes. Such a talented cast. After each episode I felt like I had watched a movie but was engaged the entire time. This was a show that I was itching to get home and continue watching. Definitely binge-worthy, and left me wanting to explore Wright’s other work!

Love Robin Wright. She’s amazing. Very frustrating show though. Cherry with her dispicable character doesn’t get what she deserves. Not satisfying at all. Not sure if Olivia Cooke was right for this role but she does play a decent villian like in house of the dragon. She’s definitely stereotyped herself with this role. I don’t think I can see her in any other role but a negative one.

I don't really understand why I tortured myself by watching the entire season. This was such trash. Why is anyone fighting over the son? He is such a tool! The plot is ridiculous, the characters are not the least bit believable, you don't even know who to root for because everyone is so unlikable!
They are talking about a season 2, Ill be certain to skip it!
