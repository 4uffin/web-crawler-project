Beauty in Black is not prestige TV, but it’s a frothy and twisted soap that you might find yourself bingeing.

Love Beauty in Black keep it coming!! Season 2 episodes was short but good, and Tyler Perry need to bring back if Loving You is wrong and the haves and have nots as soon as possible cause the last episode on both shows left me stunned so I want him to finish the shows, before he moves on to something else.

Beautiful in Black in my humble opinion is Tyler Perry's greatest work. It is witty, hilarious, hood and bougie simultaneously. Debbie Morgan deserves an Emmy for her portrayal of Olivia. Kimmie's character development has been amazing to see and I am hoping that Netflix and Tyler Perry give us an early Christmas gift by dropping the 2nd half of the 2nd season.

Beauty in Black is nothing short of exciting and hilarious — a show that knows how to deliver on every level. Both seasons have been absolutely amazing, keeping the energy fresh, the writing sharp, and the characters unforgettable. It’s rare for a series to stay this consistently entertaining, but Beauty in Black manages to do it with style. If you’re looking for something that will keep you laughing while pulling you into a truly engaging ride, this is the show.

Beauty in Black is back for a second season, and it's even better than the first. The acting is much stronger, and the show feels more polished overall.
​Kimmie's new personality is a major highlight. She takes control and teams up with Horace, creating an awesome new partnership that makes the show even more interesting.
​The only real issue is that Tyler Perry releases the show in two parts, which makes us have to wait. It's frustrating when the season is so phenomenal and you just want to watch it all at once. Despite that, this season is a must-watch and a huge step up.
