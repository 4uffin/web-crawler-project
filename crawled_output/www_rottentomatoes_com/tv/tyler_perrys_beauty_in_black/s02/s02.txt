Beauty in Black is not prestige TV, but itâ€™s a frothy and twisted soap that you might find yourself bingeing.

The very last episode was the best. Everything else I fast forward because the dialogue was not good. Tyler P. You have to write better dialogue. We love supporting you. I wish you would write your shows like you would do your plays.

Love Beauty in Black keep it coming!! Season 2 episodes was short but good, and Tyler Perry need to bring back if Loving You is wrong and the haves and have nots as soon as possible cause the last episode on both shows left me stunned so I want him to finish the shows, before he moves on to something else.
