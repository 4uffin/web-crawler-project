Beauty in Black is not prestige TV, but itâ€™s a frothy and twisted soap that you might find yourself bingeing.

Beauty in Black is nothing short of exciting and hilarious â€” a show that knows how to deliver on every level. Both seasons have been absolutely amazing, keeping the energy fresh, the writing sharp, and the characters unforgettable. Itâ€™s rare for a series to stay this consistently entertaining, but Beauty in Black manages to do it with style. If youâ€™re looking for something that will keep you laughing while pulling you into a truly engaging ride, this is the show.

Beauty in Black is back for a second season, and it's even better than the first. The acting is much stronger, and the show feels more polished overall.
â€‹Kimmie's new personality is a major highlight. She takes control and teams up with Horace, creating an awesome new partnership that makes the show even more interesting.
â€‹The only real issue is that Tyler Perry releases the show in two parts, which makes us have to wait. It's frustrating when the season is so phenomenal and you just want to watch it all at once. Despite that, this season is a must-watch and a huge step up.

Almost 5 Star!! However, I enjoyed the heck out of Season 2 and I am enjoying the direction of Kimmie and Horace. As far as the other incidents, why didn't they just call 911, which by the way made the ending suck. I need for Kimmie's buddies to get their acts together,and hopefully Alex will choose a side. I hope the next episodes will make it all make sense. Season 2 was definitely worth the wait!

I had Season 2 of Beauty in Black on my calendar to watch because it came out on the same day as another Tyler Perry's shows,
ZATIMA that I LOVE watching. I felt Season 2 of Beauty in Black was mouth watering I couldn't get enough just watching one episode. I finished it watching it in 2 days. I would've finished it on the 1st night it came out but I got sleepy because it had a long work day on September 11! I'm sad I finished watching it and now I have to wait on Season 3. I know it's going to be mind blowing! ðŸ˜Œ
