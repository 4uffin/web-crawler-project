Beauty in Black is not prestige TV, but itâ€™s a frothy and twisted soap that you might find yourself bingeing.

Ok, so when it first started, I thought Body was the worse actress. Her "gangster " was just not believable.
The characters were ok but the dialogue was bad. Season 2..... dialogue is even more worse, than the previous season, and it makes it kinda cringey to watch. Especially
the mouths
on Olivia and Mallory, which proves just because
you have cash doesn't mean you have class. Felicia's portrayal of the world's ghettoest hood rat, comes off as desperate
and tacky, but I guess that's how she was written. The drama is good, but the writing could be better. They don't have to cuss so much to get their point across. I did love Kimmie's boss up.
I hope there is more character growth in the protagonists by the full end of season 2.

The very last episode was the best. Everything else I fast forward because the dialogue was not good. Tyler P. You have to write better dialogue. We love supporting you. I wish you would write your shows like you would do your plays.

Love Beauty in Black keep it coming!! Season 2 episodes was short but good, and Tyler Perry need to bring back if Loving You is wrong and the haves and have nots as soon as possible cause the last episode on both shows left me stunned so I want him to finish the shows, before he moves on to something else.
