Binging “The Pitt” allows us to remember that we’re watching one day, and one place, where a whole lot of short-sighted and greedy legislative decisions flock, leaving it to a group of dedicated people to patch up the victims -- us -- and keep going.

All in all, it was a very sharp season of television with outstanding performances across the board.

It’s already without question the finest example of the genre in more than a generation.

This show doesn’t just flirt with your worries – it drags your fears into a trauma bay, hooks them up to monitors, and lets them flatline right in front of you.
Rated: A+

This was, one of, if not the best show in 2025.
Enjoyed the premise and showed the inner workings of the ER. I was in an ER in New Hampshire and asked if anyone one saw the show.
They said YES! The nurses pointed out to me it was spot on accurate and gave it passing grades.

One of the best medical TV shows I have ever seen. As a medical professional, the medical accuracy in this show was a breath of fresh air. The show did a phenomenal job of depicting the mental and personal struggles that are faced every day by those working on the frontlines.
