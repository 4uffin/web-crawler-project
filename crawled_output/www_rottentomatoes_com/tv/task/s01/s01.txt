Critics Consensus
Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey are superb in Task, a culturally-specific crime story that's unrelentingly bleak but equally riveting.

Give each episode room to breathe—maybe go for a walk, feel the sun on your face—and the show can be rewarding in its own determined way.

“Task” asks us to swim in deep waters that get murky in spots, but safely brings us to the opposite shore, satisfied to have enjoyed the experience.

Financial Times
No doubt it will be divisive, particularly for those not inclined to indulge its more verbose tendencies, but even when it meanders around its themes and its sprawling plot, it does so with rough, gruff elegance.
Rated: 4/5

The Playlist
While it may sound dour on the surface, it never plunges into the outright bleakness of either of those HBO dramas. Instead, the show locates its atmosphere in a more moody, haunted, and ruminative key—serious, yes, but never suffocating.
Rated: A-

The show is rich in complexities and contradictions, which makes it an exhilarating experience.

Task has the same subtly droll humor as Mare Of Easttown, and is anchored by a fantastic, emotional performance by Mark Ruffalo.

A lot of the bad reviews by the audience not all but some are just because they don't like Mark ruffalo.

Being a fan of Mare of Easttown, I really wanted to like this. Sadly there is no comparison. The show lacks the power of Mare and Mark Ruffalo is no Kate Winslett. He doesn't have to ability and presence to lead and better the material as she does and it shows in the result. The story is not as deep or engaging as well. Disappointing.

I generally don't like Ruffalo but this role seems to fit him - dumpy and depressed.
That said, this show is basically just a rip off of Apple's Dope Thief, even down the setting (depressing Delco, PA).
