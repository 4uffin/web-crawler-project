Critics Consensus
Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey are superb in Task, a culturally-specific crime story that's unrelentingly bleak but equally riveting.

Give each episode room to breathe—maybe go for a walk, feel the sun on your face—and the show can be rewarding in its own determined way.

“Task” asks us to swim in deep waters that get murky in spots, but safely brings us to the opposite shore, satisfied to have enjoyed the experience.

Financial Times
No doubt it will be divisive, particularly for those not inclined to indulge its more verbose tendencies, but even when it meanders around its themes and its sprawling plot, it does so with rough, gruff elegance.
Rated: 4/5

The Playlist
While it may sound dour on the surface, it never plunges into the outright bleakness of either of those HBO dramas. Instead, the show locates its atmosphere in a more moody, haunted, and ruminative key—serious, yes, but never suffocating.
Rated: A-

The show is rich in complexities and contradictions, which makes it an exhilarating experience.

Task has the same subtly droll humor as Mare Of Easttown, and is anchored by a fantastic, emotional performance by Mark Ruffalo.

So gripping and exquisitely pulled off by the cast and crew. Great storytelling where I immediately cared about the characters and was invested from the first few scenes. Very cool show

How is this getting any positive reviews?
Task might be watchable if not for one thing.
Mark Ruffalo can't act.
There.
I said what everyone else is thinking.
Now say it with me.

Yes, this show lacks real characters. Characterizing certain people shows things in a very unreal way to try to sway people's minds are ridiculous. Anyone who writes and gives reviews here are entitled to speak their minds. We shouldn't single out people just because they give a certain rating. Shows no class but shaming. No one shamed because have an opinion.

I liked episode one. I will be watching more. Good cast, intriguing story. We'll see if it ends up being just another crime drama or something special. First episode is a little slow as they build the world and introduce the characters, but it ends in tension and drama.

lol at others, like Iris B, sinking the general rating of this show after just one episode.. Your agenda is boring and painfully obvious. It’s folk like you who are severely lacking in self awareness. Saying you’re tired of Hollywood depicting whites as trashy characters, while leaving a trashy comment, is pretty entertaining.
