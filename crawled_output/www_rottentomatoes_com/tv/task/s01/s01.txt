Critics Consensus
Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey are superb in Task, a culturally-specific crime story that's unrelentingly bleak but equally riveting.

Give each episode room to breathe—maybe go for a walk, feel the sun on your face—and the show can be rewarding in its own determined way.

“Task” asks us to swim in deep waters that get murky in spots, but safely brings us to the opposite shore, satisfied to have enjoyed the experience.

Financial Times
No doubt it will be divisive, particularly for those not inclined to indulge its more verbose tendencies, but even when it meanders around its themes and its sprawling plot, it does so with rough, gruff elegance.
Rated: 4/5

Akron Beacon Journal
You watch it for {Mark] Ruffalo, who has always shown he’s an extremely talented actor and gives Brandis an element of humanity not often given to such individuals and [Tom} Pelphrey’s Robbie is far from shallow.
Rated: B+

Task is easily the best thing on TV at the moment. A gripping crime drama with deeply sympathetic and complex characters on a collision course with no good outcomes likely. It’ll keep you on the edge of your seat.

Exclaim!
Ruffalo leads the series with a deft hand, while Tom Pelphrey shines as the antihero we slowly get drawn in towards.

I would say Mark Ruffalo is a cancer to Hollywood but that might too kind.

I do like Mark Ruffalo, but not even he can save this boring crap. Not much of a "Task Force", but mostly a dull family drama with really horrible actors. 1/10 points.

Tough shoes to fill after Mare (watched twice). I couldn’t get through second episode. Writing is mediocre. Mark’s character lacks. I definitely expected better from creator.
