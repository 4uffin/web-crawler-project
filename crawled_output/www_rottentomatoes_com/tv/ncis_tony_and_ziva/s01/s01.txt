What makes the show worth watching are Weatherly and De Pablo, two extremely attractive middle-aged people with genuine chemistry.

The new series delivers the goods so deftly that Tiva fans will have no problem saying ‚Äúbetter late than never,‚Äù with conviction.

It's predictable, reliable and wrapped up in a tight 43 minutes.
Rated: 3/4

We‚Äôre not fans of the case Tony and Ziva have to figure out on NCIS: Tony & Ziva, but we like the fact that Weatherly and de Pablo are back in their fan-favorite roles, and their chemistry is as good as ever.

In offering nothing but undemanding fan service, "NCIS: Tony & Ziva" manages to avoid anything dramatically satisfying that justifies its own existence. It's watchable in the same way the average crime procedural is, and disposable in the same way too.
Rated: 4/10

... this pivot is the perfect way to tell Tony and Ziva's story, which is haunted by all the things left unsaid during their sudden exits. It may be a shock to the system, but it is promising.
Rated: 8/10

The first 4 eps are really good. A powerful and heartfelt return of two very loved characters. It blends thrilling storylines and action with emotional moments: exploring love, trust and family. A strong, character-driven spin-off that feels so fresh but also nostalgic at the same time.
I can really recommend watching it.

Amazing show. Everything a Tony and Ziva fan could want. It's not your mom's NCIS and it's not meant to be. This is a show for Tony and Ziva fans. NCIS was never a family show and this is a paid service so it's pg 13. If you watched the mother ship and wanted to watch Tony and Ziva finally get to admit their feelings. Then it's for you. Anyone giving it a bad review over a few swear words on a paid service has a hidden agenda.
