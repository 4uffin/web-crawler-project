Alison Herman
Variety
The plot prefers to hammer the viewer with the simplistic image of good guy Americans versus “monsters at the door” over the finer points of geopolitical conflict.

Keith Watson
Daily Telegraph (UK)
Kitsch is a diverting anti-hero, morphing from fraternity-embracing band of brother to an “every man for himself” everyman. Thanks to him, The Terminal List: Dark Wolf has just enough brain to compensate for its overdose of gun-toting brawn.
Rated: 3/5

The Terminal List: Dark Wolf takes fans on an action-packed journey into the life of Ben Edwards before his time in Chris Pratt's The Terminal List. The story itself is compelling and dark, even if it takes a while to find its footing.
Rated: 6/10

In a world of seemingly endless movies and series about spycraft, soldiers at war, or returning from war, government agents, and espionage, Dark Wolf does nothing to stand out from the pack.

So boring.
This feels like a 90 minute movie that’s been dragged out into a 10 hour series.

As a Marine I can tell you that the stories and behavior of these Seals would never fly they would all be in Leavenworth Prison for life. But, the show is Entertaining and fun to watch.

Five episodes in. It's am impressive piece of work (caught at least one credit for Antoine Fuqua as EP). Action sequences are suspenseful and the pace is utterly intense.
Bravo Chris Pratt.
