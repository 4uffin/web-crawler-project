Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

The action and the visuals are first class, and the special effects are a clever mixture of the latest in computer-generated imagery and the old-fashioned type of practical effects used back in the early "Alien" days.

The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

Radio Times
It's a series that has a lot on its mind, a host of compelling characters, and a willingness to down some offbeat avenues, all while delivering the chills and thrills that Alien fans expect.
Rated: 4/5

Amazing,entertaining,scary. All of these things contribute to this amazing franchise and this show doesn’t hold back. At some points it may miss chance to get some gore in there but that’s ok. The music is phenomenal and the show really leans into the wonders of the universe, corporate chaos and so much more. This show is perfect not only for alien fans but many people. A MUST WATCH!!!

I tried really hard to like this show. I am a huge alien fan and thought the practical effects and set were really well done. However, the story is absolutely terrible with characters making the absolute dumbest decisions I’ve ever seen. It genuinely feels like everyone across the board was chugging that stupid juice. They make the original crew of the Nostromo look like geniuses and they were just glorified space truckers.
Also, why did this have to be a prequel? Why couldn’t this take place at any other time? Every time they bring up something new all I can think of is well that doesn’t make sense based on what time this is supposed to be.
Also, we didn’t need to include all of the other aliens in this show. I already think we see the Xenomorph too much and don’t get me started on that eyeball octopus thing.

As fan of the Alien movies I always thought that Alien 3 it is besides Alien and Aliens a very good movie. I liked the way they have chosen for it, to kill of Hicks and Newt was a drastic change to the franchise that not all people liked. But to be honest, Ripley is a character that has been ment to be alone. That's just one of the reasons I like Alien 3. So as you can see everyone has different opinions. I must say that I like the series. It's the little things that caught the attention. For example the first discussion between Kirsh and Wendy has a deeper meaning to it. She was afraid of the scorpion at first but Kirsh made her emphasize for it, that plays out when you see how she treated the Chestburster, like a pet and sensitive. Or even how Boi shows obviously how much he doesn't like Hermit. It's because Hermit stands for everything what Boi doesn't like. He doesn't like to follow rules, he is the Boy that doesn't want to grow up. So all of this is really good written. Even the 5th episode is great. Everyone complains why the crew is so stupid...I guess if you would be on a mission for 65 years and wake up from time to time it could be normal that some incorrect behaviors creep in or that you somehow lose your mind and get a bit insane. So overall a good show that of course has it problems. I personally don't like the Alien design and it is shown to often by daylight. In Alien you have never obviously seen that a man was in a suit. In the series it is unfortunately to obvious and that ruins it a bit. I hope that they will fix this in the next seasons.

Review of The Alien Earth Series (up to Episode 7)
I’ve really loved this series up until Episode 7. The world-building, characters, and concept have been fantastic — but in this episode the writing started to feel a bit lazy.
From the beginning, the show established clear rules for its universe, and that consistency is what made it so compelling. But in Episode 7, many of those rules seemed to be thrown aside just to push the plot forward. For example, the Indian synthetic suddenly struggles to move his body, even though he was shown to have superhuman strength — yet later the girl can rip someone’s jaw off with ease. Similarly, the synthetics are supposed to be nearly invincible, but they’ve been dying as easily as humans. The girl goes down with a single shot, and the scientist gets completely melted away without any safeguard. If his consciousness could be transferred to a synthetic body, surely there should be a backup — otherwise the entire appeal of becoming synthetic feels undermined.
I still think the series has huge potential, and I really hope the writers tighten up these inconsistencies. Up until now it’s been one of my favorite shows, but if the rules of the world keep being bent or broken whenever it’s convenient, it risks losing the depth and uniqueness that made it so great in the first place.

Quelques épisodes intéressant dans le scénario et le decor.
Cependant je suis déçu de la réalisation d alien et de voir traîner en longueur la quarantaine.
Le jeux d acteur est parfois limite, des incohérences pour un lieu ultra sécurisé et un homme ultra riche niveau sécurité...
Je m'attendais à mieux. A voir le dénouement mais ça sera un cliff hanger qui n aura rien de surprenant
