What to Know
Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

The action and the visuals are first class, and the special effects are a clever mixture of the latest in computer-generated imagery and the old-fashioned type of practical effects used back in the early "Alien" days.

ABC Radio (Australia)
The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

James Hibbs
Radio Times
It's a series that has a lot on its mind, a host of compelling characters, and a willingness to down some offbeat avenues, all while delivering the chills and thrills that Alien fans expect.
Rated: 4/5

The persistent need to loudly illustrate so many of the show’s themes, especially while ignoring so many interesting ones, makes Alien: Earth feel more like something aimed at children when it would be much better served for the show to grow up.

While a good premise, the writing in this series isn’t well thought out and lacks basic intelligence regarding character decision making. Becomes silly at times.
The creatures are cool though. Please do better , or hire new writers

Good production and effects can't hide the fact that Alien Earth suffers from massive plot and story weaknesses and adds nothing to the Alien universe other than fan service. A waste of time.

At first, I thought it was terrific. But by episode 6, the characters started making very obviously stupid decisions. The writers could've done a better job, but instead, they allowed the characters to do what would advance their plot forward. By the time something really stupid happened, I was done watching. It's rare for me not to finish a series, but this series completely lost my trust.

It's just so dumb, I can't even watch it anymore due to the absolute abysmal writing and decision making in this. It's exhausting. Signing out on ep6.

Soooooo many plot holes. Vast majority of the characters are soft-brained idiots. Even the ones that are supposed to be smart. This is one of those shows where you just have to suspend logic, and enjoy the cinematics. If you can do that, it’s a fun show.
