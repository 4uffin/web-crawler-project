What to Know
Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

The New Republic
As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

The action and the visuals are first class, and the special effects are a clever mixture of the latest in computer-generated imagery and the old-fashioned type of practical effects used back in the early "Alien" days.

ABC Radio (Australia)
The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

Radio Times
It's a series that has a lot on its mind, a host of compelling characters, and a willingness to down some offbeat avenues, all while delivering the chills and thrills that Alien fans expect.
Rated: 4/5

The persistent need to loudly illustrate so many of the show’s themes, especially while ignoring so many interesting ones, makes Alien: Earth feel more like something aimed at children when it would be much better served for the show to grow up.

I'll be damned. They made a synthetic that looks just like Timothy Olyphant! No idea what the critics are so excited about. The first two episodes put me to sleep. S U P E R slow.

When a spaceship containing various alien parasites crash lands on Earth, a "Neverland" android goes in to save her brother and becomes Eliza Thornberry in the lab. The more intricate androids are an interesting addition to the franchise but the introduction of so many aliens felt like a lot and took away from the Xenomorph action.

This series is an absolute shame and disrespect to the alien franchise.
The storyline is soo bad and boring.
As a hardcore Alien franchise fan,I must say that this series is nothing more than disappointment.

Fantastic show. Many of these negative reviews are bonkers. This is the best entry in Aliens since Aliens.

Absolutely silly plot points. Expansive ideas cut with “hey here’s a xenomorph in case you forgot that this was an Alien movie”. Cool effects though.
