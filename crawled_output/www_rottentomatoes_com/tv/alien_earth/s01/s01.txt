What to Know
Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

The New Republic
As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

The action and the visuals are first class, and the special effects are a clever mixture of the latest in computer-generated imagery and the old-fashioned type of practical effects used back in the early "Alien" days.

Exclaim!

ABC Radio (Australia)
The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

Radio Times
It's a series that has a lot on its mind, a host of compelling characters, and a willingness to down some offbeat avenues, all while delivering the chills and thrills that Alien fans expect.
Rated: 4/5

It's a departure from the regular treatment of the Alien series.
But it's got a lot of interesting things going on in it.
And I like the way it treats the hybrids, human minds transferred into android bodies.

Completly laughable. Caracters without depth. No Storyline. Partially unlogical... Simply annoying.

Truly Disney is where good IPs go to die.
The writing in this show is child-like in its depth and reasoning.
It is simultaneously boring and nonsensical.
Character motivations make no sense and the decisions characters make are B-horror film levels of dumb.
The only thing good I can say about it is that it looks good, but even that has the caveat of only being true when the director decides to directly copy sets from the original movie.
I kept waiting for this show to get good, and just watched it get worse, and that's not a good feeling.
