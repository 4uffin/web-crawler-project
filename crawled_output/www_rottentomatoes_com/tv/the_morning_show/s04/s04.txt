It’s only a matter of time before the whole thing comes crashing down in a heap of self-important nonsense.

[The show's] storylines may not be the most interesting, but they do have a tension that makes you want to see how it all turns out. [Full review in Spanish]

As it is, the show is a glossy, elevated soap opera, which should go down easier on a weekly watching schedule.
Rated: 2.5/5

Awards Buzz
There are standouts and memorable scenes to be found throughout the season, but this is one series that might benefit from being pared down to its most essential and efficient elements instead of constantly trying to cover as much as possible.
Rated: 6/10

The Contending
Apple TV+’s The Morning Show is often social media’s punching bag for how outlandish some of its storylines are (Bradley Jackson in space, anyone?), but season after season, the series delivers consistent, bingeable drama, and Season 4 is no different.

Season four is sexy, drama filled with twisty turny storylines that would make Shonda Rhimes blush. I absolutely loved season four.
Rated: 4.5/5

The Morning Show is overrated and mediocre and gets worse with every season. I suppose Apple has the money to burn and star egos need to be satisfied. It didn't deserve to be renewed.

A must-see series that’s exaggerated, but not too far from the truth.
