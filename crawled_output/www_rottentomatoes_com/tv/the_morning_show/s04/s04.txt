TheWrap
That’s really the magic of “The Morning Show.” It’s packed with big stars doing occasionally good work, playing characters who exist in the same world they do but with more important jobs than they have.

San Jose Mercury News
Aniston anchors the entire production and gives a career-high performance this season.
Rated: 3.5/4

Rebecca Nicholson
Financial Times
Everything thrown into the pot, in the hope that something will stick. As ever, it half works: it is endlessly watchable, often devour-able, even if it is nonsense, made shiny and smooth by its A-list cast.
Rated: 3/5

Frame Rated
There’s no hashtag or headline-making story that The Morning Show won’t shoehorn into its narrative, and this season’s no different, although it finally understands how to do it more subtly.
Rated: 3.5/6

Ed Power
Irish Times
Aniston and Witherspoon, by contrast, play it straight – but far from anchoring The Morning Show in any sort of grittiness, their deadpan turns make them look like unwitting punchlines of a grand farce.

Next Best Picture
Guilty more often than not of telling the news versus shaping the narrative, “The Morning Show” can’t help but plod along for another talented yet overstuffed season.
Rated: 5/10

The Morning Show is overrated and mediocre and gets worse with every season. I suppose Apple has the money to burn and star egos need to be satisfied. It didn't deserve to be renewed.

A must-see series that’s exaggerated, but not too far from the truth.
