Gen V — Season 2
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Tastefully navigating the tragic loss of Chance Pedromo while getting a big boost from Hamish Linklater's villainous turn, Gen V's sophomore season gets high marks as a spinoff that feels essential.

Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm.
Rated: 4/5

The series delves deeper into how we push children in our technologically driven society to see themselves as products that can be sold to a broader audience, rather than as individuals who can exist beyond the bounds of consumption.

David Opie
Empire Magazine
Gen V has levelled-up for season two thanks to its ability to balance the franchise’s signature cartoonish graphic grossness with three-dimensional character work. Forget Compound V – inject another five seasons of this straight into our veins.
Rated: 4/5

Geek Vibes Nation
Gen V Season 2 serves as a solid bridge leading into The Boys Season 5, offering plenty of twists and storylines that will likely play a major role in the main series’ final chapter.
Rated: 7/10

Black Girl Nerds
Gen V’s sophomore season delivers just as much gruesome action, dark humor, poignant themes, and engrossing drama as before, now with the added grimness of Homelander’s new world order.
Rated: 5/5

TV Guide
There's admittedly a whole lot more to like in this season, but with the trappings of the Boys-verse looming large over this spin-off, those pleasures are fleeting, even expendable.

The first three episodes were really boring and might be the weakest episodes of The Boys franchise. If it gets better I might change my rating

Weak story; occasional action; nothing that surprises; mostly unfunny: basically an inferior of the first season.
This is disappointing.
A blunt knife with no edge trying to cut through white bread.
