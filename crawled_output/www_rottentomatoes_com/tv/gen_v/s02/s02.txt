The series delves deeper into how we push children in our technologically driven society to see themselves as products that can be sold to a broader audience, rather than as individuals who can exist beyond the bounds of consumption.

Empire Magazine
Gen V has levelled-up for season two thanks to its ability to balance the franchise’s signature cartoonish graphic grossness with three-dimensional character work. Forget Compound V – inject another five seasons of this straight into our veins.
Rated: 4/5

The Daily Beast
Try as it might to elevate its tale’s importance to the level of The Boys, it comes across as a repetitive and charisma-challenged teen-supes saga that’s yet to fully mature.

Heaven of Horror
I have been a big fan of The Boys and the spin-off series Gen V since the beginning, so I was very pleased with the eight episodes in this season as well. If you’re a fan, I can’t imagine you won’t love these new episodes as well.
Rated: 4/5

Paste Magazine
The season is the well-structured mess that we’ve come to expect from this franchise. Linklater’s Cipher is, perhaps, the best villain yet out of either show, and, as mentioned, Polarity’s arc is worth the price of admission alone.
Rated: 8/10
