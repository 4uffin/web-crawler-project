David Opie
Empire Magazine
Gen V has levelled-up for season two thanks to its ability to balance the franchise’s signature cartoonish graphic grossness with three-dimensional character work. Forget Compound V – inject another five seasons of this straight into our veins.
Rated: 4/5

Nick Schager
The Daily Beast
Try as it might to elevate its tale’s importance to the level of The Boys, it comes across as a repetitive and charisma-challenged teen-supes saga that’s yet to fully mature.

Vicky Jessop
London Evening Standard
It could all read as cliché and overly self-referential, but the show carries it all off with just the right amount of swagger and attitude. God U is just as awful as ever; thank goodness for that.
Rated: 4/5

After a slow star Gen V season 2 becomes a great next chapter for The Boys Universe and ends in a way that makes me excited for the final season

Pop Culture Maniacs
If you’re a fan, you’re going to stay a fan. If you aren’t, season two isn’t going to turn you into one. But there are some strong performances within a messy story.
Rated: 3/5

Beyond the Trailer
Jaz Sinclair & Hamish Linklater carry what's overall a very weak season in The Boys Universe. Unfortunately, things don't really pick up until the last three episodes. This is The Boys answer to The Marvels, but with a much better villain which saves it.
