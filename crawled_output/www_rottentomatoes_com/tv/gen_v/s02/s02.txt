Critics Consensus
Tastefully navigating the tragic loss of Chance Pedromo while getting a big boost from Hamish Linklater's villainous turn, Gen V's sophomore season gets high marks as a spinoff that feels essential.

“Gen V” may not reach its highest potential, but it’s impressive, entertaining, and ambitious in its own right. The team should be proud, and the fans should be happy.

Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm.

The series delves deeper into how we push children in our technologically driven society to see themselves as products that can be sold to a broader audience, rather than as individuals who can exist beyond the bounds of consumption.

Season 2 might start off a little slow, but once it finds its groove, Gen V is wickedly entertaining, while balancing grief arcs, political paranoia, and hilariously disgusting supe gags.
Rated: 3/5

As it continues to skewer the politics and society of real-life America, Gen V also keeps up its crackling writing.

Just be aware it’s a lot of teen drama, but with the added stress of superpowers. Gen V Season 2 isn’t just surviving in The Boys’ shadow; it’s carving out its legacy, one bloody, unflinching step at a time.

The production value is great. I like some of the characters.
The story seems like an allegory for some lefffft-wing fantasy. Maybe it is because of everything that is going on in the world that coincides with the theme of the show, but cmon, this just seems like it’s here to rile people up.

Worst three episodes of this series by far.( not because of the political stuff either) ( but just bad writing).hopefully it gets better but this is horrible!.. It looks like they cut their CGI budget in half,. And put the rest on Botox.!

100% political bullshit all along, if at least it was funny, but it's on the idiotic level of lunatics you can see in event who screams "fachist" at anyone white willing to have a wife and kids.
It is THAT idiotic and superficial.
Sad for everyone, a big L for the showrunner, writers, and anyone putting money in this.

It’s pretty obvious why this is getting review bombed although, I’m not sure how people didn’t realize what the show is earlier on. They’ve been making fun of conservatives since S1 E1 of The Boys. To get so mad that Gen V is continuing on that legacy makes me think a lot of reviewers don’t have much media comprehension.
Season is off to a good start, I think they handled the IRL passing of the cast member perfectly in show. The acting is all a step up as well after the actors got some extra time and experience to hone their craft. Hamish Linklater is a welcome surprise, he’s amazing in everything I’ve seen him in. Excited to see where things go from here.

Did they forget to show all characters equally? There's far too much focus on Emma, and she's comic relief at best, not main character vibes.
I've watched the first 3 episodes, and so far Emma has had more scenes than Marie and Jordan. Sam and Cate are mostly missing.
Why is Emma and the middle-aged Polarity now best of friends too? It's really weird and does not click well.
Less Emma, more Sam, Cate, Jordan and Marie.

As usual, politics and pandering have overtaken what could have potentially been a good story/season. The amount of hate driven rhetoric and clear politics of "Conservatives evil, bad, racists, etc" is overwhelming. This is the exact type of thing that led to the political assassination of CK. I won't support this.
