Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and beautifully acted from top to bottom, Adolescence is a masterclass in televisual storytelling and a searing viewing experience that scars.

It's the exploration of toxic incel culture and its effect on young men that makes the series a relevant, spellbinding exploration of a pressing moment in modern society.

Cooper, Doherty, and Graham, who plays Jamie’s guilt-stricken father, are all phenomenal.

[Adolescence] is an authentic, searing portrayal of the hardships of growing up in an age when the digital world and social media don’t just overshadow the real but manipulate and maul it in disquieting ways.

mundoCine
A father’s worst nightmare unfolds in a single-take series. (...) Adolescence is utterly devastating and bleak, yet deeply necessary and more timely than ever. One of the best new shows of the year so far. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/5

Each episode is one long camera shot and this is fascinating to observe.

Sequence shots are usually more effective in action & horror, and even with Adolescence teasing both of these genres, it masterfully develops the tension in a full blown heart-breaking drama. Kudos to this incredible cast & crew. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 9/10

‘Defending Jacob’ on Apple TV did it better in my opinion. but it’s still a good watch, it’s a little slow moving through the episodes

Amazing stuff, pure telecinema….if you despise men.
When the storytellers literally say they wanted to create a show to stoke the flames of masculine hate, they weren’t kidding.
In all seriousness, what an absolutely awful piece of hateful garbage.

Left me wishing I had not wasted my time. So many unanswered questions, the story could have been much better.

Absolutely phenomenal! Fantastic acting. If you have teenage kids you will really want to evaluate your parenting. Ran upstairs to hug my boys before the 4th episode ended.

The way it was shot was really cool and the acting was great. However, I found the storyline too straight forward. I kept waiting for some kind of twist or something that would draw my interest, but it never happened.
