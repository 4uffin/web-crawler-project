Romcoms aren’t made like they used to be
Rated: 3/5

The acting is capable and the writing is fine. The perspective is what’s special, as it respects what is small and yet sacred about life. It’s something that children need to learn and that adults are, it turns out, relieved to remember.

There is something so fiery about this season, which is that I think they're landing the plane. I like [Belly] going to Paris. I like what's happening.

Pop Culture Happy Hour (NPR Podcast)
The going out, seeing the world, meeting other people, becoming your own person has been really missing for so much of the show. And it's so refreshing that we finally are getting to see that.

Belly’s feelings and experiences are never treated as melodrama. Her anger and grief at the discovery of Jeremiah’s infidelity isn’t played up for laughs, nor is her constant pining for the better brother made into something ridiculous

Don’t mistake me, this show is utterly absurd...None of this matters, though, because it (begrudgingly) makes for excellent TV.

The best of all three seasons by far. Yes, it still has its fair share of cringe, but it proves itself to be a modern classic of the teen drama genre.

I'm giving this a 1 star review, not because they actors sucked or because I don't love a good coming of age story...I give it a 1 star review because I hated the way the character Conrad ended up with Belly in the end. It was a toxic attachment and not really love. His character sucked at moving on, sucked at being a loyal big brother, he sucked at being a good boyfriend, he sucked at being a great friend. How do you not love on after your brother has been with the girl for 4 years??? Watching that show as an adult hoping that the girl chose her best friend over a guy she crushed on as a child, only to find out she goes back to the toxic guy!????
I honestly didn't even watch the remaining episodes.
If this is. Eased on a book trilogy....wow...I'm glad I didn't read it.

From the start, this show has been a mess. Belly has become an insufferable character, and don’t even get me started on Jeremiah. The romanticization of cheating and the whole dynamic between Belly, Jeremiah, and Conrad is completely absurd. They’ve basically been raised together like cousins, yet the show acts like this is totally normal. Belly’s obsessive fixation on Conrad is extreme sure, teenage crushes happen, but she’s been like this her whole life and no one thinks that’s weird?
And then there’s Jenny Han, her other super famous book/movie series also centers on an wasian girl caught between two white boys. It’s starting to feel like a fetish. (going back to the cheating thing, XO kitty also has cheating tropes) like this is so weird.
