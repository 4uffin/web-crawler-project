Romcoms aren’t made like they used to be
Rated: 3/5

The acting is capable and the writing is fine. The perspective is what’s special, as it respects what is small and yet sacred about life. It’s something that children need to learn and that adults are, it turns out, relieved to remember.

There is something so fiery about this season, which is that I think they're landing the plane. I like [Belly] going to Paris. I like what's happening.

Pop Culture Happy Hour (NPR Podcast)
The going out, seeing the world, meeting other people, becoming your own person has been really missing for so much of the show. And it's so refreshing that we finally are getting to see that.

Belly’s feelings and experiences are never treated as melodrama. Her anger and grief at the discovery of Jeremiah’s infidelity isn’t played up for laughs, nor is her constant pining for the better brother made into something ridiculous

Don’t mistake me, this show is utterly absurd...None of this matters, though, because it (begrudgingly) makes for excellent TV.

I’m by no means a fan of most romance stories because I feel like most of them tend to set unrealistic expectations for real life but somehow this show has gotten me in a chokehold since it returned. Every week, I found myself watching and just interacting with everything happening and the final episode of the series sticks the landing. It’s very romantic, very satisfying and sets up the events of the movie that was announced.

The Summer I Turned Pretty season 3 is a show that everyone is talking about, and for good reason—it’s one of those can’t-look-away entertaining disasters. The central plot is so ridiculous yet compelling that it makes the whole thing fun to watch. Chris Briney and Lola Tung shine, making Conrad and Belly’s story genuinely excellent. That said, the side characters drag the story down and the pacing feels questionable, but overall it’s still a fun time.

"The Summer I Turned Pretty" is easily one of the most talked-about shows of 2025. This led me to start this series about a month ago, and I found myself able to catch up to live airing and keep up with the show weekly for the final few episodes. This show is a love triangle story and has a sweet and likable first season, a forgettable second season, but a genuinely well-made third and final season. I found myself way more invested in the story than I had anticipated, and it was genuinely a good time to be a part of it. That being said, sometimes the show is cheesy, melodramatic, and also not that consistent in quality. I liked how things played out in the end, and I can see how it is a fun watch for those craving a romance story to really get into. Overall, this is a solid show that saves the best season for last, so it is worth the turbulent journey leading up to it.

The best of all three seasons by far. Yes, it still has its fair share of cringe, but it proves itself to be a modern classic of the teen drama genre.
