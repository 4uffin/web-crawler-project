With seven hard-fought years of sobriety behind him, Charlie Sheen -- as you’ve never seen him -- finally leaves it all on the table, and revisits the very public peaks and valleys of his life with humor, heart, and jaw-dropping candor.

Just watching the two-part Netflix documentary series ‘AKA Charlie Sheen' can feel draining.

“aka Charlie Sheen” gives a sober perspective on stardom, entitlement, and yes, Tiger’s Blood.

If you have any curiosity at all about Charlie Sheen, you’ll consume AKA Charlie Sheen in one three-hour gulp like we did. Sheen’s forthrightness and brutal honesty as he reflects back on his eventful life so far is just that fascinating to watch.

This #winning documentary could have easily been one three hour tour, but but assuming we lacked the tiger blood required to sit long, Netflix broke it up. Fitting, since Charlie Sheen is a split personality type with one half on camera, the other off.
Rated: 78/100

Loved it!
It was raw, honest, and genuine Charlie. Nothing was off-limits and Charlie took full responsibility for his actions. I wish nothing but the best for him.

Being the older sister of a very destructive drug and alcohol abuser who turned my family upside down, especially my symbiotic mother who enabled her out of love, I found this heart wrenching.
Especially because my sister left behind a beautiful young daughter that I adopted and who has the baggage of her mother’s history with her.
My heart went out to Martin and Emilio and Charlie’s children.
It just goes to show that money and fame does not bring happiness.
I’m glad they made this documentary, no matter the intent, because there may be some people out there who will relate to this and find some revelations.

​I initially started watching it as background noise while I was doing other things, but I soon found myself putting everything aside to watch. I have watched both parts, and it is very interesting and definitely worth watching. I was even telling my mom about some of the parts.

Meh. Something to have on in the background. Nothing groundbreaking or Earth shattering.

There are pros and cons to both episodes, but altogether they are good but not a slam dunk. The most intriguing part of them is everyone that is interviewed BUT Charlie. Charlie has a way of talking a LOT but saying nothing, he can be really candid but with a lot of stuff he deflects so much while giving the impression he's revealing something. That was especially clear in episode 2 when they get down to the non-public stuff. He really got lost in rambling metaphors, starting to feel a touch of the tiger blood days again—nonsensical. Several things were brought up throughout, but left unaddressed. I wasn't surprised by anything he "revealed" as it was actually nothing. But the part 1 stories of him partying with Nick Cage were more interesting. Several things were brought up throughout, but left unaddressed. His ex's, friends, and family were great, some of them felt under-used though. Denise Richards was a surprise, I loved her. The early footage and childhood stories were really interesting. Mixed bag overall, but worth a watch.
