With seven hard-fought years of sobriety behind him, Charlie Sheen -- as you’ve never seen him -- finally leaves it all on the table, and revisits the very public peaks and valleys of his life with humor, heart, and jaw-dropping candor.

That this frustrating documentary comes with an upbeat ending is another unearned privilege.

You don’t notice until afterwards how gentle a ride Renzi has given him.

I have seen up close this side of Sheen that makes him somebody to root for and you will feel that pull in moments watching aka Charlie Sheen.

“aka Charlie Sheen” gives a sober perspective on stardom, entitlement, and yes, Tiger’s Blood.

If you have any curiosity at all about Charlie Sheen, you’ll consume AKA Charlie Sheen in one three-hour gulp like we did. Sheen’s forthrightness and brutal honesty as he reflects back on his eventful life so far is just that fascinating to watch.

I grew up watching two and a half men. What a wonderful story of Charlie Sheen. After two parts, you will feel you know Charlie Sheens story from his early acting days to his catastrophes. An absolute rise and fall of a superstar who eventually and thankfully found true sobriety.

I'm the kind of person who isn't supposed to have a natural gut reaction to this sort of lifestyle, I am expected to say how horrible addiction is and how you need to look out for your kids and that sort of thing. And I do believe all of that, but if it wasn't for the type of work my family is in I would just say the truth. Charlie Sheen is a fantastically authentic human being as he moves through different states of emotion, confidence and psychological states. It is both sad and celebratory. Hats off to him and I hope he gets back to work soon.

It was an interesting watch learning about the rise of Sheen and then seeing just how bad it got during the crash.
Its really sad seeing just how bad he looked and got.
The guy really has some special DNA to live what he lived through.
Hes a smart guy.... so it woulda been cool if he genuinely showed that he regretted some of the crazy stuff he did and talked about how it didn't do his family any favors....
But he doesn't seem to be that of deep of a thinker. Empathy doesn't seem to be something he feels.
Its more like "boy some of that stuff is uncomfortably embarrassing but the universe is a crazy place, and everything happens for a reason.
I wouldn't go back and change a thing cause then the charlie sheen story wouldn't
have been the charlie sheen story"
Happy to see he's turned his life around and was able to not go out like Hendrix or Monroe.
Signing up for two and a half men was the worst thing that ever happened to him.
It glorified his old lifestyle, ruined his sobriety, nearly killed him and was hell for his family and coworkers.

Very thin and disappointing.
We all know addiction isn't a comedy, but it this was downright depressing.

I like Charlie Sheen as an actor but never realized what a self-centered, degenerate, low-life, this guy was and continues to be. He wasn't just a drug addict, he is a narcissist and a sociopath. He had no regard for his wives and children and currently leaves notes around his home, for his children, like they are animals. Charlie Sheen lived, lives, and thinks like an animal. It's great he is sober but he is still the same jerk. So if you enjoy seeing someone you like reveal what an awful person they are, then this is the perfect show to watch. Otherwise, skip this one.
