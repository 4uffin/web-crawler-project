“aka Charlie Sheen” gives a sober perspective on stardom, entitlement, and yes, Tiger’s Blood.

If you have any curiosity at all about Charlie Sheen, you’ll consume AKA Charlie Sheen in one three-hour gulp like we did. Sheen’s forthrightness and brutal honesty as he reflects back on his eventful life so far is just that fascinating to watch.

This #winning documentary could have easily been one three hour tour, but but assuming we lacked the tiger blood required to sit long, Netflix broke it up. Fitting, since Charlie Sheen is a split personality type with one half on camera, the other off.
Rated: 78/100

BadNews R
Netflix’s new three-part documentary series AKA Charlie Sheen (2025) aims to chronicle the rollercoaster life of one of Hollywood’s most infamous figures. On paper, Charlie Sheen’s career and personal life are tailor-made for a gripping docuseries: his early promise as a breakout star, his rise to mainstream TV fame, his infamous “tiger blood” meltdown, and his years of personal controversy. Unfortunately, while the series delivers some fascinating insight for diehard Sheen fans, it struggles to sustain momentum and feels stretched far beyond what its content can support.
The first episode sets the tone—and not always in the best way. Rather than grounding viewers in Sheen’s early acting career or offering a structured timeline of his journey, it veers into long stretches about jealousy, insecurity, and comparisons to other actors. While it’s humanizing to see a star openly wrestle with envy, it comes across more repetitive than revelatory. Too much time is spent on adolescent anecdotes and filler moments that don’t push the narrative forward, making the start of the series feel meandering instead of focused.
Things pick up in later episodes, when the documentary turns to Sheen’s darker chapters—his scandals, criminal behavior, and erratic public persona. This is the material most viewers expect from a Sheen documentary, and in these moments the series becomes gripping. Seeing the raw footage and hearing candid interviews about his spirals adds weight and honesty. But even here, there’s a sense of imbalance. The show dances between exposure and sympathy without ever fully committing to either, which leaves it feeling indecisive about whether it wants to critique Sheen or redeem him.
The biggest problem is the format. At three episodes, the series feels padded. So much of the content could have been condensed into a tight, impactful feature-length documentary—say, an hour and forty-five minutes—that would have flowed better and left a stronger impact. Instead, there’s a lot of repetition and filler that drags down the pacing. It almost feels like Netflix wanted to stretch the brand power of Charlie Sheen across multiple episodes, even if the story didn’t warrant it.
That said, AKA Charlie Sheen isn’t without merit. For long-time fans, there are still nuggets of unseen footage, personal insight, and behind-the-scenes context that make it worth a watch. And Sheen himself remains a fascinating subject—equal parts talented, self-destructive, and larger-than-life. But for casual viewers or those just mildly curious, this won’t do much to hold attention. The lack of focus in storytelling and the overextended runtime make it a tough sell beyond the core fanbase.
Verdict: AKA Charlie Sheen is decent but far from essential. A tighter, single-film documentary could have packed a much stronger punch. As it stands, this is a watch for dedicated Sheen followers, not for those on the fence.

Loved it!
It was raw, honest, and genuine Charlie. Nothing was off-limits and Charlie took full responsibility for his actions. I wish nothing but the best for him.

Being the older sister of a very destructive drug and alcohol abuser who turned my family upside down, especially my symbiotic mother who enabled her out of love, I found this heart wrenching.
Especially because my sister left behind a beautiful young daughter that I adopted and who has the baggage of her mother’s history with her.
My heart went out to Martin and Emilio and Charlie’s children.
It just goes to show that money and fame does not bring happiness.
I’m glad they made this documentary, no matter the intent, because there may be some people out there who will relate to this and find some revelations.

​I initially started watching it as background noise while I was doing other things, but I soon found myself putting everything aside to watch. I have watched both parts, and it is very interesting and definitely worth watching. I was even telling my mom about some of the parts.

Meh. Something to have on in the background. Nothing groundbreaking or Earth shattering.
