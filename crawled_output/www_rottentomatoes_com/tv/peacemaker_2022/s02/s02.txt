Critics Consensus
Peacemaker's second season goes multidimensional while still maintaining a singular focus on emotional stakes, seamlessly transporting this outrageous antihero into a fresh cinematic universe.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
Dimensional travel, vengeful relatives and spurts of bloody violence set the tone for a series that remains a cartoonish change of pace.
Rated: 3/5

Guardian
Gunn clearly loved these damaged characters enough to carry them over to his shiny new universe, but he is also never afraid to put them through the wringer. It makes even the tiniest victories in their lives feel momentous.
Rated: 4/5

Slate
Like the first season, the second season of Peacemaker risks stretching too few jokes over too many hours—even if sometimes the joke going on for too long is the joke. But it’s also strangely fascinating.

Radio Times
From the opening dance number, it's an enormous amount of fun that carefully balances its surreal pleasures with impactful character-led moments – and plenty of unexpected twists.
Rated: 4/5

While I do not suffer from bird blindness, I can say that Peacemaker soars with the ducks.

Peacemaker continues to be a funny but emotional superhero drama, with a surprisingly effective performance by Cena at its center, with a fun-to-watch ensemble around him.

James Gunn has been one of his best films. Every episode draws you in without getting boring, and these episodes contain all the good things. John Cena has never played a role this well.

4 episodes into the show.
Again pretty awesome.
I'm still confused about the way they retcon the show so that it's part of the DCU as it started in the DCEU.
I don't want to spoil things here, but it seems a bit weird.
I say weird, but for all we know, this confusion might be resolved by the season's end.
How can the DCEU version of peacemaker end up having an interview with the Justice Gang of the DCU.
In a way, this implies that the DCEU never existed.
But with a portal that connects to 99 universes.
Why not keep the DCEU intact?
As we saw in Episode 1, Peacemaker killed an alternate version of himself that seemed to have a really good life in its universe.
In my opinion, that should have been the DCU's version of Peacemaker instead.
Anyways.
Doesn't matter.
Show is still rocking!
Worth watching!

Absolutna topka seriali superhero. Świetnie napisane postacie, idealna mieszanka humoru, przy którym może rozboleć brzuch od notorycznego parskania oraz aspektu dramatyczno-emocjonalnego. Studium charakteru na najwyższym poziomie okraszone genialną scieżką dziwiękową. Do tego, co żadkie ostatnimi czasy, sprawne wykorzystanie motywu multiwersum sprowadzając go do poziomu bardzo personalnego.

So far the story has been pretty good.
But I have something to say about the humor in this show. It feels like this show is just James Gunn having fun with friends, which is good. But it feels like he is having a bit "too much fun", as in, the good jokes translate well but the drawn out "funny awkward" and the "sex is funny" jokes do not.
All in all the humor wasn't as bad as in season 1, where it was bad improv peepee poopoo way too obscure reference the series. James has said there wasn't enough room for a lot of improv because of the tighter story, and you can tell, thank the lord.
Season 1
Humor: 3/10
Story 7,5/10
