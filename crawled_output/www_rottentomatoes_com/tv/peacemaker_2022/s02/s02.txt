Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
Dimensional travel, vengeful relatives and spurts of bloody violence set the tone for a series that remains a cartoonish change of pace.
Rated: 3/5

Graeme Virtue
Guardian
Gunn clearly loved these damaged characters enough to carry them over to his shiny new universe, but he is also never afraid to put them through the wringer. It makes even the tiniest victories in their lives feel momentous.
Rated: 4/5

Slate
Like the first season, the second season of Peacemaker risks stretching too few jokes over too many hours—even if sometimes the joke going on for too long is the joke. But it’s also strangely fascinating.

David Craig
Radio Times
From the opening dance number, it's an enormous amount of fun that carefully balances its surreal pleasures with impactful character-led moments – and plenty of unexpected twists.
Rated: 4/5

While I do not suffer from bird blindness, I can say that Peacemaker soars with the ducks.

Peacemaker continues to be a funny but emotional superhero drama, with a surprisingly effective performance by Cena at its center, with a fun-to-watch ensemble around him.

I don't know how James finds these tracks. Once again, an awesome soundtrack.

Every cast member shines this season. Just need more of Vigilante in the next episodes and it'll be perfect.
