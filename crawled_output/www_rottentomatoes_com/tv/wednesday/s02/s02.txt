Critics Consensus
Wednesday's second season smartly opens up to include more of the whole Addams clan, backing up Jenna Ortega's lovably heartless teenager with an ookier and spookier ensemble.

TIME Magazine
It’s all pretty delightful for those of us who are old enough to appreciate not just the referential casting, but also the just-campy-enough performances that Buscemi, Matarazzo, and the rest deliver.

Slate
The lack of a romantic plot for our lugubrious heroine is the biggest change so far between Wednesday Seasons 1 and 2. Hell, it might even be the only major narrative change, and it’s surprisingly refreshing.

If television is losing eyeballs in the digital era, then Wednesday appears to have cracked the code to retaining them.
Rated: 4/5

Driven by a star making turn by Evie Templeton in a breakthrough performance, the second season of Wednesday has enough surprises in store to get you pulled in the right direction.
Rated: 85/100

Ortega is a star, but the plotlines that surround her character need work.

Gissane Sophia
Lady Geeks Media
Brimming with secrets, more animosity between parents and children, plus a diligent exploration of what equates to completion, the season does more than an excellent job of setting the stage for a perhaps more vulnerable next step.

I very much enjoyed season 1 as it was witty, well written and had the right balance between comedy and darkness/mystery. The characters were well written and their fears and worries were relatable.
Season 2, however, was a disappointment.
The plot is a mess, the writing and dialogues are poor and the characters became quite cringe. I found it hard to relate to or care for the characters this season and the plot was sometimes hard to follow. That's sad, since there was so much potential and the banter of the Addams family was really fun in season 1.

I really enjoyed the first season, this has had some fabulous additions naming Steve Buschemi, Joanna Lumley... but why on earth lady gaga??? I personally cannot stand her... I'm well aware most will disagree with me, thats fine. I won't be continuing till the end so hope it improves, the hyde storyline is a little exhausted now.

Outstanding. I need an absorbing show to escape right now. I thought the story line was clever and the acting solid.

Wednesday is always worth a watch. The characters are very fun and charming and Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Adams is nothing short of entertaining. This season really focused more on the Adams family more so then the previous season which i really enjoyed. I am glad Morticia Adams had a bigger role because Catherine Zeta Jones is just perfect for the role.
I do believe this season is weaker then the first one but still worth a watch. A complaint I had was the multiple Plot points that the show would keep bouncing back and forth from each other. They would focus on one plot point and then pause and go check out the other one just to remind us that it is still important. I was disappointed that the villain they were teasing us on in the beginning of the show was just thrown aside just to bring back a plot point that apparently did not end after season 1. But in the end I still enjoyed the show and the world of the Adams Family. I cannot wait for season 3 to start but i truly believe that if they do the same stuff again for season 3 it will begin to lose its appeal.
