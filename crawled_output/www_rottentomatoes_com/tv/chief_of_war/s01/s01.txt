Critics Consensus
Starring Jason Momoa at his ferocious best, Chief of War is a brutal epic that recreates Native Hawaiian history with commendable authenticity.

Empire Magazine
Momoa's magnum opus cuts a brutal swathe through epic chapters of Hawaiian history, long unseen and long overdue on screen — but you do wish the quieter moments carried as much weight as the barbaric battles.
Rated: 3/5

Chief of War is invigorating, compelling and sweeping and also gives Momoa one of his meatiest roles yet.
Rated: 3.5/4

Cut from a similar cloth to Shōgun, this grand, ambitious series deserves to call itself an epic.
Rated: 4/5

It grips you from the opening minutes, as Kaʻiana (played by Jason Momoa) faces off against a shark in the depths, and it doesn’t let go until the final shot, when spilled blood stains the slopes of a volcano. This is a story that seeps under your skin.

Exclaim!
An epic series that delivers both the complexities of history and [Jason] Mamoa's finest work as an actor to date.

SSG Syndicate
Authenticity abounds from an indigenous perspective, a nearly all-Polynesian cast & Hawaiian language with English subtitles.. Epic in scope & scale, the cinematography is dazzling and the fast-paced, intense, ultra-violent battle scenes are spectacular.
Rated: 8/10

Like many people I was rooting for this movie since it was supposed to portray Hawaiian history and culture. Sadly, it fails both as a movie and as a depiction of
historical events. Queen Keopualani and other major figures are eliminated. The "hero," Kaiana was a traitor to Kamehameha. The evil captain Metcalf never came ashore and would have been squashed like a bug since there were 800,000 people living in the Islands at the time. Kamehameha was a fierce warrior, not the pacifist farmer shown in the movie; his "Law of the Splintered Paddle" was meant to protect the lower, class of common people in Hawaiian culture, not political rivals. I could go on. Dramatic license in making a moving is one thing, but this is like making a movie about Lincoln and showing him riding a big white horse leading the troops at Gettysburg and later killing John Wilkes Booth in a knife fight. I am sad that people will think this movie is authentic. The glory of the Hawaiian Kingdom is greatly distorted and undersold by this film.
