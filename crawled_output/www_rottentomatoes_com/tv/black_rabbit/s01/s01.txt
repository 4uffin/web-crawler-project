It lacks that inherent watchability a crime drama needs to pull viewers into the macabre tale; even the most depressing stories can still have viewers glued to the screen if the characters and plots are compelling enough.
Rated: 1.5/4

Still, though later episodes will reveal an early event that might explain something about Vince, it’s not enough to make one care especially what happens to them, except to worry which innocent bystanders... will be hit by shrapnel when things go boom.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
The New York depicted here is grimy, but basing the show around an achingly cool restaurant...gives the series a glossier sheen than dramas such as Ozark and Breaking Bad, to which the writers of Black Rabbit clearly aspire.
Rated: 4/5

What should be a propulsive crime thriller never quite gels, and that starts with Black Rabbit's aggravating structure.

We get the feeling that Black Rabbit is going to be problematic and overstuffed as the series moves along, but Law and Bateman are so compelling as Jake and Vince, we’ll keep watching, just to see how far Vince pushes his brother’s goodwill.

You can never go wrong with anything Ozark-esque that Jason Bateman had a hand in.

Where to even start with this show.
It's all over the place.
There is just too much going on with the characters in the beginning that you don't care about them and you end up asking yourself, why are the non-main characters acting this way?
Let's start with just the first episode when you don't know what is going on.
The first scene is a party for something that you just don't know what's going to happen but the director and writer make it too chaotic and then there is an action sequence.
Then BAM!!
You don't know what happened to that first scene in the bar.
You can't tell if it's from the past or present and you don't hear about anything from it for a long time.
The next scene is like morning and they start off everything about this character "Anna" as if she's SO important that this restaurant can't function without her, MEANWHILE she looks like a druggie tattooed all over addict coming out of a bathroom.
You are given NO clues as to why she is the way that she is but the OWNER is freaking out over her not showing up to work.
LIKE REALLY!?
As a viewer, I'm really suppose to care in the beginning?
Oh, you don't find about about Anna's story until episode 3 but by then there is so much going on that you just don't care about her and the storyline that seems like it doesn't belong in the series.
This is where the next part of the series was going on a downfall.
Law, the owner of the restaurant, is being ran over by ALL his employees.
For instance, the main chef is a woman that is yelling and then threatening Law to go against his own family.
It's so unbelievable!
It's like the storyline tries to keep the chef as a part of the main storyline BUT there is no place for her.
She is a COOK and for some reason the story is making it a HUGE deal about her being some type of extraordinary cook when the storyline has nothing to do with her.
Who cares about her and the cooking abilities.
The story is about the two brother's and how they are in trouble.
The writer and the directors forgot about that along the line.
They are dragging the audience all over with these sideline stories that the viewer just doesn't care for.
While on episode 3, it felt like 6 episodes already past which isn't a good thing.
The only reason why it has 2-stars for this review if because of the main actors Law & Bateman.
They are great actors and when you are watching their stories unfold you remained interested.
No one cares about the Chef and Anna.
Heck, I don't even know the name of the chef and I only know Anna's name because that's all they talked about for the first two episodes and by the time they FINALLY tell her sob storyline, you really don't care and over it but then you get mad because the chef starts yelling at the owner as if she's the one in charge.
That's not reality tv in anyway.
It feels like the writer and director is trying to forcefully push an agenda to the audience which no one cares about anymore.
Wake up, just stick with the main characters (the brothers) arch and you'd have a hit show but as for right now, it's huge bust due to the writer/director and unbelievable side characters.
