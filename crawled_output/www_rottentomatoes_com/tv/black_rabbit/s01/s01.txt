Daniel Fienberg
The Hollywood Reporter
It makes the more morally righteous characters too boring and one-dimensional to count as heroes, and the less morally righteous characters too cartoonish to count as people.

Liam Mathews
TheWrap
Nothing on its own is enough to make the show unwatchable, but it all adds up to something that isn’t as good as it should be for the genre it’s working in and the level of budget and talent involved.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
It gets repetitive, but it doesn’t get to the core of their relationship. That’s a shame because some of the other storylines tied to the pair have illuminating possibilities.
Rated: 3/5

Abe Friedtanzer
Awards Buzz
In a landscape of so many crime series, this show doesn’t entirely stand out. Law and Bateman are both extremely watchable even if their characters don’t feel expressly unique.
Rated: 7/10

Exclaim!
While the ending is satisfying enough, it doesn't warrant pushing through the slow burn and put-upon varnish.

Screen Rant
Black Rabbit is darkly thrilling, technically brilliant, and tragically human. It's not Netflix's Ozark replacement; it's Ozark's worthy successor.
Rated: 9/10
