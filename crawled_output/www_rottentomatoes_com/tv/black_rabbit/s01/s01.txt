The Age (Australia)
It gets repetitive, but it doesn’t get to the core of their relationship. That’s a shame because some of the other storylines tied to the pair have illuminating possibilities.
Rated: 3/5

Globe and Mail
We writhe because we can see justice in the near distance, yet we cannot reach it. Black Rabbit makes your heart race. Until it breaks.

TIME Magazine
Black Rabbit is worth watching for its stylish direction, propulsive pace that mitigates some of the narrative wheel-spinning, and most of all Law and Bateman’s brilliantly cast brother act.

However, audiences will embrace Black Rabbit because it may stretch the boundaries of believability, but beneath all those distractions is something fundamentally human.
Rated: 9/10

RIOTUS
If there was ever a slow-burning Cain and Abel dynamic, it’s Vince and Jake. Their Black Rabbit-hole is a biblical case of mutually assured self-destruction, and the toxicity is high.

Black Rabbit is Netflix’s next prestige thriller—sharp, unsettling, and impossible to turn off.
Rated: 8/10
