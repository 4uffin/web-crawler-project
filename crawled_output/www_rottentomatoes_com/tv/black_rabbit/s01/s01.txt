Daniel Fienberg
The Hollywood Reporter
It makes the more morally righteous characters too boring and one-dimensional to count as heroes, and the less morally righteous characters too cartoonish to count as people.

Liam Mathews
TheWrap
Nothing on its own is enough to make the show unwatchable, but it all adds up to something that isn’t as good as it should be for the genre it’s working in and the level of budget and talent involved.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
It gets repetitive, but it doesn’t get to the core of their relationship. That’s a shame because some of the other storylines tied to the pair have illuminating possibilities.
Rated: 3/5

George M. Thomas
Akron Beacon Journal
"Jason]Bateman is grungy and manipulative and while audiences are used to seeing the latter in characters he portrays, the former is a revelation."
Rated: B+

Pedro Paunero
EscribiendoCine
The series presents itself as a contemporary tale which reveals that, beneath the facade of success and sophistication, the same destructive passions still beat within us - from yesterday, from today. From always. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 8/10

CBR
However, audiences will embrace Black Rabbit because it may stretch the boundaries of believability, but beneath all those distractions is something fundamentally human.
Rated: 9/10
