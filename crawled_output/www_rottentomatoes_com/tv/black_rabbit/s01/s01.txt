Roxana Hadadi
New York Magazine/Vulture
Rabbit’s core is the relationship between restaurant owner Jake and gambling and heroin addict Vince, two men who constantly disappoint and protect each other, and the unexpected richness of the Law-Bateman pairing complements and elevates everything.

The Times (UK)
We’re served up a story that sometimes flirts with the implausible, but add Law, Bateman and a glossy production and any rough edges can be forgiven.
Rated: 4/5

Slate
There’s so little variation in its eight-plus hours that its intensity becomes merely oppressive. The show keeps telling us it’s for real, but it’s writing checks that it can’t cash.

Inverse
Black Rabbit unfolds over a brutal eight hours, which often has the show treading water as it repeats familiar beats ad nauseum, and fills its dialogue with so many f-bombs that you start to wonder if the writers ran out of things to say.

Original Cin
A well-plotted, tense, engrossing thriller, populated by strongly drawn, richly interesting characters. Black Rabbit plays like an intense New York crime story, but doesn’t let down the personal stories.
Rated: A

NME (New Musical Express)
Proper, old-fashioned character work wrapped up in a sharp, no-nonsense thriller that bothers to take its time.

I’ll watch anything with Jason Bateman. He’s one of the most believable actors working today. This show is super edgy and gritty. Has a vibe like Ozark, which I loved.

This could’ve been knocked out in an hour. Eight hours worth of bs non-stop situations gets old. Jason Bateman’s character is highly annoying! His acting is overboard and he attempts too hard to be a cool guy loser that constantly burns down everything around and they just put up with it. Totally unrealistic and after a while it made me want to fast forward just to get to substance and the end.

Absolutely fantastic. Felt like a masterpiece to my wife and I. Loved the darker side of the ups and downs of life being portrayed. Felt much more alive and really dragged us in. Jude really popped off on this one. Especially the more emotional scenes. 10/10. Really sad to see such a low rating on what feels like such a breath of fresh air compared to other new releases. Thank you.

I am a huge JUDE LAW fan - gave up after one episode ... the litmus test, 'Do I want to know what happens, do I care what happens'? NO. Just felt disjointed, had no early on CORE ... have enjoyed plenty of similar stories in the genre, so why waste my relaxing time watching this.

Black Rabbit bursts out of Netflix’s streaming churn like a shot of dark espresso—thanks largely to its committed leads, tight pacing, and a visual style that feels fresh for the platform. Jude Law and Jason Bateman, as estranged brothers, deliver performances that feel raw, textured, and often surprising. Their chemistry is magnetic: Law’s sleek, brittle control plays off Bateman’s chaotic restlessness and snarky-ness in an epic way.
What sets Black Rabbit apart is how propulsive it is. From the cold open to the escalating debts, fractured loyalties, and deep family wounds, each episode pushes forward with urgency. There’s real momentum—too many shows drip-feed tension; this one keeps you leaning in, wondering what mess the brothers will dig themselves into next.
Visually, the series leans into moody atmospherics—dim, layered lighting, sharp compositions, and the kind of framing that makes New York feel both beautiful and foreboding. There’s texture here: in the worn-luxury of the restaurant décor, in the city backdrops, in the scarred edges of its characters. It looks and feels different from the usual glossy Netflix prestige fare—less about sweeping vistas and more about lurking shadows.
Some side plots meander—but overall, Black Rabbit stands out. It’s a binge-worthy thriller with enough grit, style, and emotional punch to keep you thoroughly entertained. If you’ve been worn down by polished but predictable streaming fodder, this one’s a satisfying break.
