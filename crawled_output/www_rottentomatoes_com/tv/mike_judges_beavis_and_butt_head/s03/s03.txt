Since the show is animated, the injury and destruction Beavis and Butt-Head experience plays out like Wile E. Coyote sketches.

I remember watching Beavis and Butthead on MTV back in the 1990s. The guys were funny then and they're still funny. I wish they go back to reviewing Heavy Metal videos again.
