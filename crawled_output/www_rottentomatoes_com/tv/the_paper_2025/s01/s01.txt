The Paper still has edits to be made but gets off to a promising start, establishing amusing dynamics and a genuine conviction for journalism that make for a potentially worthy successor to The Office.

These characters and actors will win you over quickly and completely, partly because the performances are so smart and partly because the writing is, too.

They don't do a lot of direct referencing of The Office...But...[the show is] in the middle. It's pleasant. It's fine.

The Paper dispels skepticism about its very existence as it progresses. A few growing pains and the inevitable pressure to live up to a certain hype aside, the show's energy feels infectious thanks to sharp performances, writing, and editing.
Rated: B+

This gentle, likable series has some big shoes to fill.

‘The Office’ spin-off can and should be enjoyed as its own beastie as it zips through its 10 episodes in a flurry of jokes that sometimes land, gentle drama, and acute observations

There's stuff and storylines and people that I like here, but they're all being used incorrectly, in my opinion. So I did laugh, but the laughs I even had felt out of sequence.

Sometimes A.
It needs a bit more of the sick humor of the original series.

I honestly expected The Paper to be a disappointment. But within the first six episodes, it completely won me over. The show starts off a bit slow, but it keeps getting better and better. By episode 6, I found myself laughing out loud in the same way I used to with The Office—something hardly any series has managed to do since. I really hope there will be many more seasons to come!

The Paper stands well on its own as a fun mockumentary on Journalism that is surprisingly investing.
Does follow particular formula but also has its own tone and fun ideas, even if isn't always laugh out loud funny. The overall character group doesn't feel that developed yet but Domhnall Gleeson's lead is so hilariously awkward and charming and will become one of the new iconic sit-com leads.
Unlike other first seasons, this finds rhythm quite soon and the finale was fantastic, genuinely looking forward to more.

It was so bad I couldn't even sit through 2 whole episodes. They were trying so hard to be The Office and tried to force every joke that it just wasn't funny. Some parts of it were just blatent copies of The Office, the Barry character is actually just ripoff Stanley, Nicole's first talking head had the exact same tone and was very similar to Jim's first talking head, and the only thing I was looking foward to (the reprisal of Oscar) was barely there. Also the Michael replacement WASN'T EVEN TRYING TO BE FUNNY. There was also an AD with more cameos. It was so bad I didn't even want to watch the real Office because it ruined it so much.

I have not laughed once, which I guess is ironically funny given it’s meant to be a comedy. Both the characters and storyline are so DULL I’m shocked no one realised while making this show that it was criminally unfunny.
