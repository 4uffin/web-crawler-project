These characters and actors will win you over quickly and completely, partly because the performances are so smart and partly because the writing is, too.

They don't do a lot of direct referencing of The Office...But...[the show is] in the middle. It's pleasant. It's fine.

The Paper dispels skepticism about its very existence as it progresses. A few growing pains and the inevitable pressure to live up to a certain hype aside, the show's energy feels infectious thanks to sharp performances, writing, and editing.

This gentle, likable series has some big shoes to fill.

‘The Office’ spin-off can and should be enjoyed as its own beastie as it zips through its 10 episodes in a flurry of jokes that sometimes land, gentle drama, and acute observations

There's stuff and storylines and people that I like here, but they're all being used incorrectly, in my opinion. So I did laugh, but the laughs I even had felt out of sequence.

Honestly this show is way funnier than it has a right to be. I went into it fully expecting a corny show trying to bring back the glory of an older sitcom, but
it really stands on its own. Obviously some of The Office vibes are there, but if people would stop comparing it to that I think they might enjoy it more. Also, I'm not sure what the people who hate Esmeralda are looking for in television- boring people who never do anything outside the norm? She's one of the funniest characters to me and I love how over the top she is.

The Paper definitely is a great step in the right direction. Just like season one of The Office, this first season establishes what is to come and I'm excited. It's funny, characters have direction and you can tell the cast is having fun. Definitely looking forward to season two!

Slow but thoughtful.
It’s comforting, easy to follow and funny without being ridiculous.

The 3, 4 and 5 stars have to be paid reviews.
There isn’t anything funny about this.
It’s torturously not funny or good or interesting.
It’s cringe humor trying not to offend anyone.
If I could give it’s a 0 I would.

I give it a 3.5, out of 10? No, out of 5. (If you know, you know) I saw another review referencing this show as gentle and likable. I would say that’s pretty accurate. It’s a comforting show that has likable characters that grow on you overtime. My critique is that the show felt like it played it safe and it gets boring and stale at moments. Perhaps that’s just the generation it was produced in and having to fill the shoes of The Office 20 years later while pandering the new age of a more sensitive viewing population? I like it! I don’t love it. It’s like riding in a safe reliable mid size suv.
