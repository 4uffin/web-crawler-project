These characters and actors will win you over quickly and completely, partly because the performances are so smart and partly because the writing is, too.

Pop Culture Happy Hour (NPR Podcast)
They don't do a lot of direct referencing of The Office...But...[the show is] in the middle. It's pleasant. It's fine.

The Paper dispels skepticism about its very existence as it progresses. A few growing pains and the inevitable pressure to live up to a certain hype aside, the show's energy feels infectious thanks to sharp performances, writing, and editing.
Rated: B+

Exclaim!
It may take a couple season for The Paper to truly find its groove, but it's off to a ripping start already.

It’s a shame that The Paper strains itself so hard to be silly because there’s things here that work to varying degrees. Ironically, it’s when the series is content with its moments of quiet hopefulness that its potential begins to shine.

Another overated
smug comedy. There's only one likable character.
I wish they would make the "4th wall" out of concrete.

Really enjoyed the show. It grew on me and now I can’t wait for season 2.
The only issue is Esmeralda who is just an annoying character. I can see the benefit of her character early on, having held back the company, but now she needs to go.
Maybe more backstory I’d needed on some of the side characters. The old guy is dull, one episode should be his retirement party.
Overall, far better than expected!

For its first season it was honestly amazing. It’s no The Office but it stands on its own enough that there’s no point in even comparing the two. I think in terms of vibes and tone it’s more comparable to Parks and Recreation than it is to The Office. I think a lot of the characters, especially supporting characters, are more interesting than the supporting characters in a lot of sit coms in their first seasons. My only complaint is that Oscar doesn’t really fit into this cast, he does in some ways but when he does he feels like a totally different character than the Oscar from The Office.
