Foundation — Season 3
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Foundation's narratively knotty third season doesn't quite measure up to its superb predecessor, but this sci-fi epic endures as a faithful and well-acted adaptation of Isaac Asimov's masterpiece.

Craig Mathieson
Sydney Morning Herald
[Pilou Asbaek's] demonstrations add an element of horror to Foundation, which also has a sly sense of humour sneaking through. Of the many fantastical elements manifesting here, influencer satire was the least expected.
Rated: 4/5

Ed Power
Daily Telegraph (UK)
Ludicrous, lavish and larkingly largely than life, it is one of the most bonkers TV shows ever made and all the richer for that lack of inhibition. Foundation is science fiction with rocket jets cranked to the max...

The Daily Beast
Continues to put the rest of its small-screen genre brethren to shame with its momentous, magnificent third season.

The Hindu
The juxtaposition of the mighty and the micro, supported by stunning production values, makes the war between Jared Harris’ psycho-historian, Lee Pace’s clone Empire, and Pilou Asbæk’s unpredictably charming Mule irresistible

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
This season swings for the fences hard, which is excellent. I wish the flight there hadn’t been quite so bumpy.

We’re watching multiple storylines unfold – from splintering the Cleonic dynasty to desperate maneuvering of the Foundation’s new leaders – and it’s all good, but also glacial.

I really tried and watched all season 3 but it will be my last.
Too many characters you don't care about as they are on screen a few moments, too confusing. I had no idea what was going on many times.
Finally episode was existing but previous nine were not.

Season 1 and 2 got me hooked. Season 3 is a flop, it is slow at times seems all over the place not coherent to the point I have lost interest and stopped watching. Not sure if they have new writers, budget cuts or what but they have ruined what started out as a great series.

First season was a little slow and I nearly didn't continue with the 2nd season but very glad I did. The show has kept growing and season 2 was great and then the 3rd season was the icing on the cake, 3rd season a 9.5/10 for me, cant wait for the 4th!!!
Season 1 - 6.8/10
Season 2 - 8/10
Season 3 - 9.5/10
My advice is stick with it, first season a little hard to follow but then it all starts making sense and its a great watch!

Season 3 was a bit up and down, but boy were the ups high and superb. Cannot wait to see how they move forward with that ending!

What an interesting season. The story was excellent. I love the risk they take in that series while keeping it grounded (if that can be said of a Scifi). Very good effects. The actors were simply amazing. They have good parts and makes the most of it. Production value is great. I give it 88%. It does setup a lot of questions at the end.

Not quite as sharp as seasons 1 and 2 and there's a bit too much made of Gaal Dornick and Pritcher. The interplay of Lady Demerzel and Day and Dusk is marvellous. Both Day and Dusk turn in riveting performances. Dusk as nearly insane evil, and Day as compassionate.
