Foundation — Season 3
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Foundation's narratively knotty third season doesn't quite measure up to its superb predecessor, but this sci-fi epic endures as a faithful and well-acted adaptation of Isaac Asimov's masterpiece.

Craig Mathieson
Sydney Morning Herald
[Pilou Asbaek's] demonstrations add an element of horror to Foundation, which also has a sly sense of humour sneaking through. Of the many fantastical elements manifesting here, influencer satire was the least expected.
Rated: 4/5

Daily Telegraph (UK)
Ludicrous, lavish and larkingly largely than life, it is one of the most bonkers TV shows ever made and all the richer for that lack of inhibition. Foundation is science fiction with rocket jets cranked to the max...

Continues to put the rest of its small-screen genre brethren to shame with its momentous, magnificent third season.

The juxtaposition of the mighty and the micro, supported by stunning production values, makes the war between Jared Harris’ psycho-historian, Lee Pace’s clone Empire, and Pilou Asbæk’s unpredictably charming Mule irresistible

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
This season swings for the fences hard, which is excellent. I wish the flight there hadn’t been quite so bumpy.

We’re watching multiple storylines unfold – from splintering the Cleonic dynasty to desperate maneuvering of the Foundation’s new leaders – and it’s all good, but also glacial.

What an interesting season. The story was excellent. I love the risk they take in that series while keeping it grounded (if that can be said of a Scifi). Very good effects. The actors were simply amazing. They have good parts and makes the most of it. Production value is great. I give it 88%. It does setup a lot of questions at the end.

Not quite as sharp as seasons 1 and 2 and there's a bit too much made of Gaal Dornick and Pritcher. The interplay of Lady Demerzel and Day and Dusk is marvellous. Both Day and Dusk turn in riveting performances. Dusk as nearly insane evil, and Day as compassionate.

Another good season of my favorite show to combine science and science fiction. Lee Pace does a great job showing a different side of Day and flexing his ability to play serious roles and ones less so. The rest of the story is very interesting.. up to episode 10.
Episode 10 single handedly removed a star from this rating and left the story in a bad place. Instead of building on the hype created by the first 9 episodes, the last episode tears away all the story and just kind of does what it wants. None of the foreshadowing for things to come is recognized, none of the work each character put in translates to anything of meaning and ultimately it flopped really hard. I hope the direction is made better in season 4, but as of right now it spells bad directing decisions which will lead to a lackluster continued series.

Frankly very badly executed and story way too convoluted. Few characters and actor of great quality (Day and Dusk, Seldon) but all the rest is frankly worthless. The setting is B movie at best, so cheap I couldn’t believe.
