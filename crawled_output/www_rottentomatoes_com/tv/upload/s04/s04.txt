Beyond criticizing how the technology industry could monetize mourning, Upload‚Äôs fourth season issues a sharp warning about the dangers of AI ‚Äì and the humans who control it.

Upload has taken us on a rollercoaster ride as it explored life after death, technology, capitalism & what truly makes us human in a poignant & comedic way. Paired with a cast that feels more like family, it‚Äôs bittersweet this show didn‚Äôt get to continue.

There‚Äôs definitely no shortage of shocking reveals, big laughs, and moving moments to come in Upload: Season 4, so it feels safe to say that if you‚Äôve invested in this show thus far, you absolutely will want to see how it all ends.

While some arcs are ended, the bigger, darker questions of rights and power are not addressed in the truncated yet charming concluding season

Clever, witty, and insightful, Greg Daniels and company find the heart of the matter and make the whole thing worthwhile, like life itself.
Rated: 7/10

Upload Season 4 is a serviceable sendoff, as in it does its job, but I wonder what it could've been if we had more time, a longer season, and a full plot.
Rated: 2.7/5

A s√©rie √© excelente, de verdade. Muitos t√≥picos s√£o discutidos: c√≥pias de consci√™ncia, manipula√ß√£o de personalidade e de realidade, limites √©ticos, reconhecimento identit√°rio, evolu√ß√£o da intelig√™ncia artificial e muitos outros. O final deixou em aberto algumas quest√µes que poderiam ser melhor exploradas, mas deu enfoque ao suspense que a s√©rie exala. Recomendo fortemente
