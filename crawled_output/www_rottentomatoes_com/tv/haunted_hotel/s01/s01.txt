Some of the synapses you associate with laughter will experience mild stimulus. If you don‚Äôt like this gag, another will be along in a minute, and although you probably also won‚Äôt like that one, you won‚Äôt strongly dislike it either.
Rated: 2/5

Anyone who likes horror movies will spot plenty of influences and Easter eggs, and the silliness of the show becomes one of its strongest aspects.
Rated: 8/10

Haunted Hotel seeks to be for horror what Rick and Morty is for sci-fi. It‚Äôs a hilarious evolution of the genre that doesn‚Äôt just breathe fresh life into a stagnant corpse, but turns it into a lively, brain-eating dynamo that runs laps around its peers.
Rated: 4/5

As a horror-comedy that cares about its characters, it‚Äôs bigger, funnier, and braver than its comparisons for all the risks it takes.

For anyone who remembers and loves gravity falls. This show is for you, a wonderful mashup of references, tropes and cryptids from all over the horror genre. Not overly adult but not overly childish either a very entertaining, couldn't stop watching.

So I‚Äôm only five episodes into this and I can definitely say I‚Äôve seen everything that this series has to offer.
When I first saw the trailer, I thought this looks kind of fun. Let me check it out.
Woke up this morning after getting my breakfast and exercise and sat down to watch it.
And it‚Äôs just been a OK ride ever since.
I‚Äôve seen a few other reviews and all of them have one thing in common. They all say the exact same thing about this show.
It‚Äôs bland.
And that‚Äôs the perfect description of the show it doesn‚Äôt try to be anything more than what it is.
It‚Äôs so middle of the road it‚Äôs forgettable. It‚Äôs something to put on the background while you‚Äôre doing other things because every time you look up to see something you will have nothing.
I can‚Äôt even talk much about the characters because they‚Äôre all archetypes of characters you‚Äôve seen before.
The mother is virtually the straight man of the just trying to keep things in order. The uncle and the teenage son are virtually the exact same character.
Embarrassing cringe is what I think this character archetype is.
And since there‚Äôs two of these characters, they‚Äôre so redundant of each other they just kind of blended into the background.
The sister reminds me of Louise from Bob‚Äôs Burgers and that‚Äôs about it.
She apparently knows black magic somehow but she barely use.
Abandon, the demon trapped in a little boy‚Äôs body is kind of funny, but like everything else it‚Äôs seen it been there done that got the T-shirt.
Even the hotel itself, which theory should be a character in and of itself really isn‚Äôt one.
Sometimes that ghost are there
their other times when you think it would be interesting to have them around they‚Äôre completely vacant from an episode.
There are apparently monsters in this hotel but again they pop in and out so frequently you forget that they‚Äôre there.
It‚Äôs just a lot of wasted potential and middle of the road writing that I can honestly see why Netflix green lit this because it would be something easy to throw out.
Just a show to throw in during a lighter month if it does well great if it doesn‚Äôt well, we didn‚Äôt lose much.
With only five episodes left to go while I will finish this I think like most people when I‚Äôm done with it I will have forgotten about it and never think about it again.
What do you think at the end of an episode though the uncle said to the kids that this hotel has a lot of stories to tell.
And all I could think of is dude you‚Äôll be lucky to get a second season,
So yeah, boring forgettable if you have nothing else to watch and you just want something on the background throw this on.
If you want something fun to laugh at or a good semi comedy horror style thing look up the movie, dead stream or something else because this hotel is not worth checking into.
