Eric Olson
Seattle Times
To paint a related picture, “Him” is a bit like the red-faced drunk next to you at the Seahawks game: loud, fun at first, wearing thin after a few drives — asleep by the end.
Rated: 1.5/4

Beatrice Loayza
New York Times
For too long, we're like players stuck in a dark stadium tunnel, retreading the same concepts and fending off opaque threats, when all we wanted was some action.

Slant Magazine
The film leaves you wishing that the aspirational way the sport is presented in real life had been read for filth.
Rated: 2/4

Brian Eggert
Deep Focus Review
While there’s an inspired performance by Marlon Wayans at the movie’s center, Tipping’s hyperactive, darkly surreal visuals and overactive montages prove less scary than chaotic, and ultimately annoying.
Rated: 1/4

Peter Sobczynski
Auteurist Class (Substack)
According to IMDb, the new sports-horror hybrid Him was at one point titled GOAT, though judging from the end results of this mind-numbing idiocy, ASS might have been more appropriate.

Collider
Him seemingly knows that there are deeper ideas that could be explored, but instead, Tipping’s film seems willing to skirt by with just saying, “Loving football is nuts, right??”
Rated: 4/10
