David Fear
Rolling Stone
HIM ultimately takes all of these elements and throws them rapidly downfield at what feels like the most unfocused attempt at a socially resonant, allegory-heavy genre movie in ages.

Sarah-Tai Black
Globe and Mail
The movie’s second half veers almost into the territory of music video, resting on free association of clumsily-utilized, symbolically charged imagery while losing complete grasp of its own internal narrative threads.

Amy Nicholson
Los Angeles Times
It wants to be “The Substance” with jockstraps: a Satanic-tinged, steroidal “Rosemary’s Baby.” The film is so stylishly done that I could accept it on those plain terms. Every shot is a stunner.

Marlon Wayans' dynamic performance is easily the highlight of Him, which otherwise never satisfactorily pays off its fun idea of mixing the world of football with a deal with the Devil horror story.

Joseph Neff
Spectrum Culture
Some of what made the script interesting is still here, but it’s all largely undermined by the choice to leave sports-horror specialness behind for a typically gory finale that goes hard but is mostly generic.

[HIM] leaves no room for introspection, no room for interpretation, it simply throws a messy spiral right at the audience’s face and expects them to catch it before it destroys the bridge of their nose.

A little bit slow all to realize in the end it is just for one huge buildup. Really didn’t like the movie until the end. I think the end was spectacular and just what it needed.
