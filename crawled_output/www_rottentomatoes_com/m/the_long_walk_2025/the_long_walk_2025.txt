What to Know
Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.

Stephen King has been adapted a lot, but this is the leanest, meanest adaptation of his work in a long time.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
...it’s not that [the film] doesn’t work (indeed, parts of it are rather good) but that it ultimately and fundamentally can’t, given what it actually is.
Rated: 2/5

Barry Hertz
Globe and Mail
While Lawrence keeps the momentum steady and ensures that every few minutes delivers some kind of violent jolt, there’s just not enough meat to this particular roadkill story to keep one cinematic foot in front of the other.

Eileen Jones
The Jacobin
But The Long Walk foregoes such narrative complexities. And unfortunately, the stripped-down concentration on a few key elements doesn’t help build drama — instead, we get a kind of numbing sameness.

Despite a number of narrative holes, The Long Walk succeeds largely on the strength of its performances.
Rated: 3/4

Inner East Review
Filmmaker Francis Lawrence keeps to that pace, or at least allows the pace the film's characters are forced to march at set an editing tempo, and the film maintains its momentum consistently.
Rated: 4/5

Great movie. Wasn’t a fan of the ending, but a great movie overall.

If I hadn't read the book then I would probably have thought it was better, but honestly it deviates so substantially from the book that I was disappointed.

It was worth seeing for sure and kept your interest.
I would recommend, but not one of those movies that I would watch a second time but I did like it.

The bond that forms between the boys was heartwarming and sad. Every time one of the boys died, you feel the pain and anguish from the ones remaining.

I’ve always been a fan of Stephen King, so when this movie adaptation of his book came out I was so excited! While there are some notable differences between the book and film adaptation, it definitely didn’t disappoint! The ending was especially surprising since they decided to go with a different approach from the book. All I can say is GO SEE IT! Even if you haven’t read the book, this story is absolutely incredible and heart-wrenching.
