What to Know
Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.

Stephen King has been adapted a lot, but this is the leanest, meanest adaptation of his work in a long time.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
...it’s not that [the film] doesn’t work (indeed, parts of it are rather good) but that it ultimately and fundamentally can’t, given what it actually is.
Rated: 2/5

Barry Hertz
Globe and Mail
While Lawrence keeps the momentum steady and ensures that every few minutes delivers some kind of violent jolt, there’s just not enough meat to this particular roadkill story to keep one cinematic foot in front of the other.

Ceases to be shocking or tragic almost immediately... like most bleak and depressingly timely films, The Long Walk also lands as a massive so what.

The Long Walk is a grim, bleak look at a fallen America. People are broke. Spirits are in the toilet and the government patrols the city streets. No, this is not based on a true story but it feels like it could be. An intense, well-acted film.

The Times of India
With democracies turning dictatorial and the world facing economic crises, this film’s relevance goes beyond the surface. Witnessing this journey, which is open to interpretation, is as gruelling and intense for the audience as it is for the participants.
Rated: 3.5/5

Horrible.
I can't believe that they consider this a movie.
Looks like the budget was $200.
