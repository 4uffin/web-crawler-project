The Long Walk
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.

Stephen King has been adapted a lot, but this is the leanest, meanest adaptation of his work in a long time.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
...it‚Äôs not that [the film] doesn‚Äôt work (indeed, parts of it are rather good) but that it ultimately and fundamentally can‚Äôt, given what it actually is.

Barry Hertz
Globe and Mail
While Lawrence keeps the momentum steady and ensures that every few minutes delivers some kind of violent jolt, there‚Äôs just not enough meat to this particular roadkill story to keep one cinematic foot in front of the other.

WBAL-TV (Baltimore)
As much as this film was horrifying and anxiety inducing, the film highlights how powerful and life changing friendship can be. Francis Lawrence is one of our all-time best directors.
Rated: 4/5

We trudge on, and we savor the moments, knowing that The Long Walk could just as easily be the best movie for next year, or the one after, or any other year our walk continues.

Substream Magazine
There‚Äôs a version where the outcome would be inspiring, even triumphant. However, Lawrence levies his blunt force reality in ‚ÄúThe Long Walk‚Äù that even the purest of souls might not escape being tainted.

A story with so much heart. I do think the outcome is easy to figure out from the start. I‚Äôm not sure why or how this movie classifies as horror when it‚Äôs truly a suspenseful drama. Props to the cast for their performances.

Although little heavy handed at one point, it turned out to be a good sadüòäüò≠‚úäÔ∏è. If Stand by Me had a baby with The Hunger Games.

Riveting performances all around. For a movie you mite think is just about walking it is definitely emotional and if you allow the movie to do its job you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs a glaring metaphor for life.
