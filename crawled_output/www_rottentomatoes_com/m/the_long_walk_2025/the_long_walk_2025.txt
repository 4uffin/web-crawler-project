Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.

...it’s not that [the film] doesn’t work (indeed, parts of it are rather good) but that it ultimately and fundamentally can’t, given what it actually is.
Rated: 2/5

Barry Hertz
Globe and Mail
While Lawrence keeps the momentum steady and ensures that every few minutes delivers some kind of violent jolt, there’s just not enough meat to this particular roadkill story to keep one cinematic foot in front of the other.

It makes a clear and decisive statement about how such a society kills the utopian impulse that would provide hope for the future and perpetrates the values of the game even when someone tries to stop it

Movies and Shakers
Hoffman and Jonsson’s acting transcends the incredulity of the roles they play in this impactful film about friendship and cruelty in a world we hope never exists. Stephen King’s mind bending twists in this painfully slow walk, don’t tread lightly.

Luke Y. Thompson
Mortal Cinema (Substack)
At the start of the walk, the movie feels like a drive-in style high-concept exploitation movie. By the end it's a bit more than that – a thesis on whether, in the face of darkness, it's best to put on a happy face as you keep going

It was what I expected for the most part.
Would have liked a little more backstory about the events that led to the current situationsimilar to Civil war in that way.
Was hoping for a better ending.

Hard to believe something like this movie made it to the big screen. If you want to see, soldiers put the tips of rifles to young mens heads and faces, and blow their brains out, then this is the picture to see. Very disturbing. If I were Stephen King, I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this movie.

For someone who promotes gun control, King sure does peddle in gun violence.

THE LONG WALK was pretty excellent. The way it pushes character development with such unique urgency combined with persistent tension punctuated with bursts of violence and mourning is a tricky balancing act it by and large lands. David Jonsson is just superb, even more excited to see where he goes after both this and ROMULUS, and man is this another performance from Cooper Hoffman I hope his dad is somehow able to be proud of.
Say what you will about Stephen King's storied career as an author across horror, thrillers, and much more, he knows how to give his characters and themes beating hearts, and this is reflected wonderfully here. One of the best films of the year and will easily be in my Top 15.
