Scott Tobias
The Reveal
Apart from anything else, Predators is a clinic in documentary ethics, but Osit’s intellect doesn’t mute his pain, sensitivity and outrage. It’s a film for the heart and the head.
Rated: 4.5/5

Liz Shannon Miller
Consequence
The core question Predators aims to explore isn't the motivations of the original men who were caught in Hansen's trap — it's why the show was fascinating viewing for so many people.
Rated: B

Derek Smith
Slant Magazine
David Osit’s trenchant documentary recognizes that To Catch a Predator sold humiliation as entertainment in the guise of legitimizing law-and-order punitivism.
Rated: 3.5/4

Jim Vorel
Paste Magazine
Predators interrogates what we’re getting out of supposed pursuits of justice. The vulnerable, of course, must be protected. But perhaps the route to doing so should be out of the hands of those seeking their own sick enjoyment, profit or entertainment.
Rated: 8.2/10
