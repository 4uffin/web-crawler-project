Critics Consensus
Like the original, The Toxic Avenger isn't for everyone -- but viewers seeking an extremely gory, extremely silly good time won't be disappointed.

Thelma Adams
AARP Movies for Grownups
This enthusiastic revival of the 1984 original ups the tech values and adds a recognizable cast without sacrificing the original’s ick factor... No learning, no hugs, just schlock and awe.
Rated: 4/5

Ultimately, this is a fan-made effort for fans, though we're sure it will be appreciated in different ways by fans. [Full review in Spanish]

Whether poking at superhero cliches (there’s a choice post-credit scene) or trying to be kill-clever, it’s all in dopey, gruesome fun.

Movie Madness Podcast
Mason Blair has a lot of fun refashioning the Troma original with a game villain in Kevin Bacon and another true hero turn by Peter Dinklage in a delightful performance who along with Jacob Tremblay deliver sympathy between the carnage.
Rated: 3/4

It's a gory good time that never lets up and once the toxins are in Winston, there's no delay to his crimson path of revenge.

Both compromised and sad. Both entertaining and sweet. It's blood without the gore. It's a fine roast without the sharp bite.

I remember the original in all its cheesy B-movie glory. A fun and ridiculous retelling.

funny af. don't want to spoil anything but if you're more than a few minutes into it and think the tone is weird, realize that it's a satire and is parodying superhero movies. I'm a huge toxie fan, and while this wasn't that, I loved it as an alternate version of that universe. can't wait to see it again and definitely buying it if it's put out physically.
