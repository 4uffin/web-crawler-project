Everything about â€˜The History of Sound' is restrained to a fault.
Rated: 2/4

Maxwell Rabb
Chicago Reader
The History of Sound is too tonally restrained to deliver the heart-wrenching love story it aspires to. A meandering narrative further undercuts its romantic potential, too assured in its soft tone to fully unravel its charactersâ€™ pain.

New York Times
The History of Sound doesnâ€™t trust its own gentleness, and the inertia of the filmmaking gives the whole affair a detached, try-hard feeling.

Discussing Film
Some might be left underwhelmed by the quiet, restrained forbidden romance at the center of The History of Sound, but the movie actually thrives off those untold feelings and emotions, especially when Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor are at their best.
Rated: 4/5

Cinemalogue
... understated to the point of frustration, with conflicts remaining largely internalized and its poignancy rarely resonating as deeply as intended.

Geek Vibes Nation
It isnâ€™t the most engrossing or even inviting take on romance, but there is a loveliness to find within the stillness.

Itâ€™s a quiet movie.
The film is beautifully shot and gives you insight into a time which is slower and serene. Well acted and moving performance by the two main leads.

Erin G
It feels like the director lost their religion half way through the film. The delicacies of nature in the audio was abundant early on then disappeared. The intimacy that was so striking to the character that it transformed his life was given more time in silence and distance than in exploration or anger. The character seems too distant from the memories the story hoped to explore, and therefore I, as an audience, felt distant and in waiting. The synesthesia element of Lionell's character was a world left unexplored not only in his story but also in his relationship with David. Folk music and vibrations in the hills of the country, of the air, and in your self is a beautiful poetry that was only briefly admired while it could have been embraced and danced with for the entire film. Italy seemed irrelevant. Too many scenes felt too short to be necessary for the story. Absolutely beautiful acting done by Josh O'Connor and Paul Mescal
