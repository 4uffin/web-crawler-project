The History of Sound
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Its drawn-out pacing and overly familiar trajectory undermine its potential to truly surprise, but The History of Sound nonetheless offers a visually stunning and well-acted journey through its melancholic exploration of human connection.

The History of Sound might not set the internet on fire, but it will leave a few embers burning in the hearts of any audience who takes the time to listen to its particular song.

Carla Meyer
San Francisco Chronicle
In the film’s second half, as Lionel and David return to their regular lives, it becomes clear that O’Connor’s and Mescal’s acting had been doing too much, and the script too little, of the heavy lifting.
Rated: 2/4

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
Mescal and O’Connor each have a natural ease and awkwardness that fits with the plight of their characters... Sound reminds us of the toll that’s taken when you can’t fully embrace your desires and loves.
Rated: 3.5/4

Armond White
National Review
Hermanus and Shattuck forget that the word “history” derives from the Greek term that means “learning or knowing by inquiry.” The History of Sound is so aesthetically arid that it embraces repression.

Josh O’Connor and Paul Mescal deliver gorgeously moving performances every time they’re on screen, making the entire film a wholeheartedly vulnerable showcase of humanity.

Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor had good chemistry, but the pacing was soooo slow and didn’t feel like the emotional payoff at the end was earned.

A little slow, but seems appropriate for the time its written. Space for contemplation, reflection and decision. Life seemed simpler then. Sweet love story.

It’s a quiet movie.
The film is beautifully shot and gives you insight into a time which is slower and serene. Well acted and moving performance by the two main leads.
