The History of Sound
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Its drawn-out pacing and overly familiar trajectory undermine its potential to truly surprise, but The History of Sound nonetheless offers a visually stunning and well-acted journey through its melancholic exploration of human connection.

Alison Willmore
New York Magazine/Vulture
Like Lionel, The History of Sound becomes stuck on its youthful interlude, a period that‚Äôs more alive than everything that comes next, and that‚Äôs also, less successfully, presented as a mystery to be solved.

Everything about ‚ÄòThe History of Sound' is restrained to a fault.
Rated: 2/4

Maxwell Rabb
Chicago Reader
The History of Sound is too tonally restrained to deliver the heart-wrenching love story it aspires to. A meandering narrative further undercuts its romantic potential, too assured in its soft tone to fully unravel its characters‚Äô pain.

The History of Sound is often plain and pitch-perfect; the notes it plays just tend to be staid when they could be stimulating.
Rated: B-

What happens if a movie skips the yearning entirely and just gets straight to the point? Unfortunately for Oliver Hermanus‚Äô The History of Sound, the answer to that question is, ‚ÄúNothing good.‚Äù

Discussing Film
Some might be left underwhelmed by the quiet, restrained forbidden romance at the center of The History of Sound, but the movie actually thrives off those untold feelings and emotions, especially when Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor are at their best.
Rated: 4/5

It‚Äôs a quiet movie.
The film is beautifully shot and gives you insight into a time which is slower and serene. Well acted and moving performance by the two main leads.
