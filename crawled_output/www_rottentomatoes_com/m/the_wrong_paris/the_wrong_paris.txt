Even with classic rivalries and storybook romance attempts, ‘The Wrong Paris’ just doesn’t scratch a genuine itch.
Rated: 1/4

The Wrong Paris, written by Nicole Henrich and directed by Janeen Damian, somehow serves the synthetic sugar of both The Bachelor and the Hallmark movie without any sweetness. The formula is there, but not the flavor.
Rated: 2/5

While the movie’s production design has considerable mojo, the anodyne writing reins in whatever satire one might have expected.

Yet, even with the chemistry of a couple, the twists and turns in a story, and a great happily ever after, the details can sometimes ruin the fantasy.

It’s cheeky and silly, but with strong bones, such as likeable characters, a strong narrative structure, and an original script.
Rated: 4/5

Netflix’s The Wrong Paris is surprisingly delightful and lighthearted fun, all thanks to its cast and writing.

This is a definite hallmark type movie where the acting feels cheap, the look of the movie is just weird, kind of blurry and super orange like it’s always “golden hour” adding to the cheap look of the movie. I’d almost recommend any other hallmark movie over this but because it has Miranda Cosgrove I thought it would be good, I was wrong and truly am disappointed in this movie.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I love country music and romcom’s so this was perfect. I’m not one to watch the Bachelor/Bachelorette but the trailer for this movie, sucked me in. Hoyt guy, cute girl on a farm. Miranda and Pierson were electric together. I enjoyed their alone moments the most. The scenery was beautiful!
I loved the character of Rachel rooting for them. The other ladies in the contest were equally enjoyable to watch.
The music was fabulous! Breland and Buck McCoy vocals and sings fit in perfectly. I find myself humming, Paris Texas Man. While the storyline is predictable, it was a nice way to escape reality for a few hours and see some happiness. Will watch again for music and chemistry.

if I could give it negative I would, the concept was there and had some redeeming characters, BUT the acting was NOT good.
