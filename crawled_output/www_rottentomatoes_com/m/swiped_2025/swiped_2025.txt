Inspired by the provocative real-life story of the visionary founder of online dating platform Bumble, "Swiped" introduces recent college grad Whitney Wolfe, played by Lily James, as she uses extraordinary grit and ingenuity to break into the male-dominated tech industry and launch an innovative, globally lauded dating app (two, actually), paving the way to becoming the youngest female self-made billionaire.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Glossy to a fault, Swiped packages its true events as a rote reenactment instead of delivering the feminist story it could have been.

Adrian Horton
Guardian
The history of how online dating went from deeply uncool to de rigueur is one worth telling, and Swipedâ€™s methods, corny and contrived as they can be, are proficient enough to do it.
Rated: 3/5

Alissa Wilkinson
New York Times
Swiped aims to explore the difficulties of being a woman in a manâ€™s world, from workplaces to the internet more widely. It does so in broad strokes with predictable characterization.

Kevin Maher
The Times (UK)
The director and co-writer Rachel Lee Goldenberg never fully attacks and instead shifts skittishly between a Devil Wears Prada-style you-go-girl success story and the tougher darker film that occasionally emerges.
Rated: 2/5

We're Watching What?!
We've seen too many better crafted founder biopics at this point and if there's anything exceptional about the subject aside from her gender the film fails to convey it. Though it does successfully capture a fraction of the horror of being a woman in tech
Rated: 2/5

The Straits Times (Singapore)
This shallow, legally sanitised biopic of a tech founder lacks depth and arrives too soon.

The Mary Sue
It isnâ€™t a perfect biopic and it isnâ€™t one of the more serious attempts at telling these stories but it is a fun and interesting look into how Bumble came to be.

I don't know how to feel after watching Swiped. 1st of all, it's not awful, I can see people having a fun time with it, but unfortunately what I thought was the best part of the movie was the acting and the strong performance, and I mean that because the movie literally starts by telling us that the performances aren't actually what they really went through, it's just to lightened the movie in total. That really left me disappointed in the end, because if you're going to make a biopic, don't tell us that, it automatically lowers people's expectations, and if you can't tell a biopic right, then don't make a movie out of it. If they didn't say that, then I would have had a better experience, but that's just my opinion, I hope that there will be some people who will enjoy Swiped, but for me, really disappointed

I felt the story was much less accurate then what really was going on. The movie is trying to be very optimistic in order to empower women tech capabilities, but reality was much more complicated, I can guess. I was very
