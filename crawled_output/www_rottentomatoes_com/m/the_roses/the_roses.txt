Life seems easy for picture-perfect couple Ivy (Olivia Colman) and Theo (Benedict Cumberbatch): successful careers, a loving marriage, great kids. But beneath the façade of their supposed ideal life, a storm is brewing -- as Theo's career nosedives while Ivy's own ambitions take off, a tinderbox of fierce competition and hidden resentment ignites. The Roses is a reimagining of the 1989 classic film The War of the Roses, based on the novel by Warren Adler.

The Roses
What to Know
Critics Consensus
The Roses' blend of broad comedy and dark satire makes for an uneasy marriage, although watching Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch trade barbs is a treat onto itself.

Stephen Romei
The Australian
The dazzling script is thespian heaven for the stars, Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch, who put a wicked British spin on this remake of Danny DeVito’s 1989 movie The War of the Roses...
Rated: 3.5/5

Chicago Reader
The pacing switches too suddenly between vigor and slackness, leaving the film without the propulsion its absurd premise demands, causing the conflict to drag on.

NPR
It's a throwback film, the kind they don't make anymore -- and given the sheer amount of Screenwriting 101 cliches that pile up -- you can't help thinking that might be a good thing.

A battle of the sexes for today with a brilliant satiric screenplay supported all the way with wonderful, relatable performances by all, especially th two lead actors

Mel Campbell
ABC Radio (Australia)
Blackly hilarious, in what comes across as a very British way … but I was surprised that it focused so much on the affection in this marriage. This is a story of two people who punish each other out of disappointment, because they both feel abandoned.

Movie Madness Podcast
There is something distinctly American about this story and utilizing a pair of our most charming English actors reduces 10% of the original’s bite. Jay Roach and the script reduce the other 90% of the dark satire resulting in a remake that is a true zero
Rated: 1/4
