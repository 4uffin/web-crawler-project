Life seems easy for picture-perfect couple Ivy (Olivia Colman) and Theo (Benedict Cumberbatch): successful careers, a loving marriage, great kids. But beneath the façade of their supposed ideal life, a storm is brewing -- as Theo's career nosedives while Ivy's own ambitions take off, a tinderbox of fierce competition and hidden resentment ignites. The Roses is a reimagining of the 1989 classic film The War of the Roses, based on the novel by Warren Adler.

The Roses
What to Know
Critics Consensus
The Roses' blend of broad comedy and dark satire makes for an uneasy marriage, although watching Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch trade barbs is a treat onto itself.

The Australian
The dazzling script is thespian heaven for the stars, Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch, who put a wicked British spin on this remake of Danny DeVito’s 1989 movie The War of the Roses...
Rated: 3.5/5

Chicago Reader
The pacing switches too suddenly between vigor and slackness, leaving the film without the propulsion its absurd premise demands, causing the conflict to drag on.

It's a throwback film, the kind they don't make anymore -- and given the sheer amount of Screenwriting 101 cliches that pile up -- you can't help thinking that might be a good thing.

Movie Madness Podcast
There is something distinctly American about this story and utilizing a pair of our most charming English actors reduces 10% of the original’s bite. Jay Roach and the script reduce the other 90% of the dark satire resulting in a remake that is a true zero
Rated: 1/4

National Review
None of the couple’s success, failure, or fame reflects the unsatisfying ups and downs of these times. Roach and McNamara cheat us of understanding ourselves. The Roses plays like a hoax. Hollywood can’t go on making movies like this.

The Roses is a very good movie, but what makes it exceptional are the two leads: Benedict Cumberbatch as Theo and Olivia Coleman as Ivy.

jesse v
watch as we see an array of emotions that Benedict cumberbatch can do when he's not dr strange. he's so much of a british intellect that the wife is just a gaslighting annoying wet sponge that would love to cook for the rest of her life. so much so that they attract a token/cliche group of friends, the kids get completely forgotten, and the writers keep adding American references and even MARVEL. WHY DID IT END LIKE THAT??

The movie has a slow start with a few parts that were hard to understand. Once the ball gets rolling though , thos is quite a funny movie. It has some genuinely well thought out comedy that most married couples can find to be believable. It's a must see.

Loved it. Quite funny, but defiantly not for kids or families due to language.
