A screw-turning psychological thriller made for the moment, LURKER is the razor-sharp directorial debut from The Bear and Beef writer-producer Alex Russell. When twenty-something Los Angeles retail clerk and loner Matthew (Théodore Pellerin) encounters rising pop star Oliver (Saltburn’s Archie Madekwe), he takes the opportunity to edge his way into the in-crowd. But staying there isn't easy. With an entire entourage (Bottoms' Havana Rose Liu, Abbott Elementary's Zack Fox, Y2K's Daniel Zolghadri, mid90s' Sunny Suljic) vying for attention, Matthew must prove himself to Oliver as more than just a follower. As their bond grows strained and mainstream fame appears within reach, access and proximity become a matter of life and death. Online fixation meets reality in this parasocial, paranoid cat-and-mouse film driven by star-making performances. With an incisive view to contemporary culture and a brilliant score from Kenny Beats (known for his work with Vince Staples), LURKER presents an exhilarating take on the music industry, the blurred line between friend and fan, and our universal search for validation.

The American Dream of being seen curdled into a nightmarish hall of mirrors.

Lurker feels less like a narrative thriller and more like a chilling, genuine document of how easy it’s become to manipulate those around us in a hyper-digital world, where the mere proximity to celebrity can be as powerful as celebrity itself.

Alison Willmore
New York Magazine/Vulture
It may be a sad reflection of an existence, but what Lurker wryly suggests is that Oliver himself couldn’t exist without people like Matthew around him, believing in his importance, proving themselves willing to say or do anything to stay nearby.

with a strong ensemble cast and an unhinged story, Russell earned enough grace from the audience not to lose moviegoers in the final act.

Style Weekly (Richmond, VA)
The film’s cynicism is creepy, then moving and wickedly amusing.

Not That Rob Thomas (Substack)
The fact that Russell clearly knows his way around the Los Angeles music scene, and the insulated ecosystem that both supports and feeds off a celebrity, gives “Lurker” a rich texture and absorbing tension.
Rated: 4/4

This film is an interesting ride. It does a good job at making you feel you’re experiencing the events in real time. I do feel there were several unanswered questions & missed opportunities. Overall, the story lacked & didn’t fully land for me.

The cringey power dynamic between the two lead characters almost made me walk out in the first 15 minutes but I'm glad I stayed. It was a fascinating study of neediness and power and control. It had a very satisfying payoff.
