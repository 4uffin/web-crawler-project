Kristy Puchko
Mashable
For all the atmosphere and the grounded yet disturbing performances, the movie fumbles its finale, delivering neither nerve-shredding scares nor a heart-filling nor heart-wrenching resolution.

Guardian
The story feels like a supernatural horror or a ghost story, and yet doesn’t conform to either... It’s an eerie, disquieting experience.
Rated: 4/5

Financial Times
The nerves are kept at a steady jangle, but the movie also hums with ideas. Too many for one story, some may say, though from where I’m sitting, better that than too few.
Rated: 4/5

That Shelf
Anchored by two commanding performances, The Man In My Basement is a film that lingers. It trades in suspense and philosophy rather than cheap thrills, offering an unsettling but rewarding experience for audiences willing to meet it on its own terms.

Dafoe is as reliable a presence as ever, but The Man in My Basement squanders its intriguing premise, bottoming out long before the picture ends.

The Curvy Film Critic
Although, The Man in the Basement suffers at times as a muddled psychological thriller whose subtext, in many instances takes over, it's the beautifully anchored performances by the  Dafoe and Hawkins, that make this adaptation worth the watch.

Interesting storytelling and solid acting w a decent build up that didnt end up revealing anything to the audience they dont already know, so the ending ends up half hearted.
