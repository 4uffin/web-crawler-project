If you have kids, take them to see The Light of the World. It’s a worthy and edifying cinematic experience—especially compared to the alternatives in pop culture today.

Mortal Cinema (Substack)
The problem is that Light of the World isn't much of a movie – it's a biblical tract for kids that makes sure characters always say their names out loud and repeat key scriptural points

While the story of Jesus has been told in many ways over the years with varying degrees of quality, this does the story justice with top-tier animation with its heart in the right place.
Rated: 9/10

The gorgeous animation alone is worth diving into this version, even if the story is fairly traditional.
Rated: 6/10

Despite the fact this production is hand-drawn 2D animation, every character has more depth than a lot of the live-action versions.

I wanted to really like this film since it is about my Lord and Savior. However, being an artist and animator and a believer myself, I can't in good conscious recommend this film. Not only was the animation subpar and "stiff-like". The dialogue was a bit childish. I know that this film was catered to kids, but you have to entice the parents as well. Also, one of the main reasons why I wouldn't recommend this film is the message at the end regarding salvation. This poetic prayer at the end with John and Zebedee in the film is very nice but it misses the point. It is not about a prayer it's simply believing in the Lord Jesus Christ to save you from your sins. Did the thief on the cross sight this prayer? No, he simply believed in Jesus and because he believed, Jesus saved him to be in His Kingdom forever.
