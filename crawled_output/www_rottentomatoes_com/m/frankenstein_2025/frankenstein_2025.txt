What to Know
Critics Consensus
Finding the humanity in one of cinema's most iconic monsters, Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein is a lavish epic that gets its most invigorating volts from Jacob Elordi's standout performance.

The Ringer
Frankenstein is elaborate and expensive but also weirdly muted beneath its color-coded production design; like Nightmare Alley, it’s immaculate and bland.

Guillermo del Toro delivers a moving masterpiece of horror and romance.

Wall Street Journal
Mr. Del Toro tells the story from the point of view of each lead character, but that merely makes this shaggy film twice as long as it should be. Like this Creature, it’s a marvel to look at but dead inside.

ScreenAnarchy
Frankenstein straddles the middle of a fine popcorn extravaganza, and a thoughtful gothic art film. ... An auteur operating in grand form well within a comfortable wheelhouse.

Terence Johnson
Le Noir Auteur
Through no fault of Jacob Elordi’s, whom I quite liked as the monster, the second half of the movie flattens out tremendously as many of the bigger swings del Toro attempts just end up not [ringing] true.

The brilliance of Del Toro’s film lies in its portrayal of the hypocrisy within the experiment, particularly regarding Victor.
Rated: 8/10
