Adam Nayman
The Ringer
On the one hand, casting a brand-name pro wrestler as a well-known mixed martial artist is completely on the (prosthetic) nose. What’s remarkable about his work in The Smashing Machine, though, is how little of the Rock comes out.

CBC Radio
Emily Blunt is the heavyweight performer delivering an electric charge to a somewhat dramatically flat answer to Raging Bull.

Peter Howell
Toronto Star
Supporting performances from real UFC legends and a Kerr cameo add to the palpable naturalism of this sweat fest, which aims for the heart rather than the head.

Joonatan Itkonen
Toisto.net
A tremendous piece of directing and acting working together to remind us that beyond the glamour and showmanship, Dwayne Johnson is a bonafide actor waiting to break out of his shell.
Rated: 4/5

That Shelf
A compelling work that often defies convention, The Smashing Machine is a revelation.

Ruben Peralta Rigaud
Cocalecas
one of the most honest films of the year. Because it dares to look at glory from the other side, to tell a story where muscle isn't enough, where strength doesn't save. [Full review in Spanish]
