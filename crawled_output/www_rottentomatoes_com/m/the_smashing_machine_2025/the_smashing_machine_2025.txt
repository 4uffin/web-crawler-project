What to Know
Critics Consensus
Dwayne Johnson goes the distance with his transformative turn as Mark Kerr in The Smashing Machine, a gritty biopic that sidesteps cliché even at the expense of narrative satisfaction while still landing the dramatic body blows that count.

Adam Nayman
The Ringer
On the one hand, casting a brand-name pro wrestler as a well-known mixed martial artist is completely on the (prosthetic) nose. What’s remarkable about his work in The Smashing Machine, though, is how little of the Rock comes out.

Emily Blunt is the heavyweight performer delivering an electric charge to a somewhat dramatically flat answer to Raging Bull.

Peter Howell
Toronto Star
Supporting performances from real UFC legends and a Kerr cameo add to the palpable naturalism of this sweat fest, which aims for the heart rather than the head.

Angelo Muredda
Film Freak Central
The problem is that outside of the acute depiction of opiate addiction and recovery and this amusingly incongruous portrait of a strong yet sensitive and soft-spoken man there’s too little here to justify the project.
Rated: 2/4

… a disappointing barrage of botches.

Hot Button (Substack)
It’s a frustrating thing when a movie gets so much right, but doesn’t quite find its way to come together in a fully satisfying way. That, I am afraid, was my experience of The Smashing Machine.
