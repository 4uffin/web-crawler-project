In Twinless, two young men meet in a twin support group and form an unlikely friendship. Roman (Dylan O'Brien) and Dennis (James Sweeney) both search for solace and an identity without their other halves and soon become inseparable outside the group. But when Roman meets Dennis' ebullient co-worker, Marcie (Aisling Franciosi), all is revealed to be not what it seems, as each man harbors secrets that could unravel everything.

Twinless isn’t what you might expect it to be. It’s much more normal, and therefore much more haunting, than that.

Los Angeles Times
Though O’Brien is flexing his emotional range here, his hunky sincerity lands in part because Sweeney remains steady in the opposite registry.

Just trust me when I say that it’s extremely clever and full of surprises, and reinforces that writer, director, and co-star James Sweeney is a bold and refreshing filmmaker to watch.
Rated: 3.5/4

Common Sense Media
Sweeney's dark dramedy navigates a delicate line between grief and absurdity and benefits from O'Brien's fabulous twin performances.

The movie's comedy was laugh out loud good. And the drama and emotions of all the characters were so strong that I felt all that they were feeling.
