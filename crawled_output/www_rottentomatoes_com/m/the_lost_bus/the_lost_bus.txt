The Lost Bus demonstrates how powerfully drama can illuminate a story we might have thought we knew.
Rated: 4/5

Mashable
The Lost Bus — despite its best efforts to celebrate an everyday hero — becomes a messy journey of rancid masculinity.

Greengrass doesn’t tell you how to feel, he’s practically screaming at you

Collider
The Lost Bus may not reach the heights of some of Greengrass' finest work, but that's a high bar to reach. The latest film from Apple TV+ rises above its shortcomings, resulting in a gripping docudrama that is worthy of your time.
Rated: 7/10

Matthew Creith
Matinee With Matt
Not since "Backdraft" has a movie focused on fires been so, pardon the pun, explosive. Paul Greengrass delves into the multifaceted challenges California faces regarding fires and the annual dangers they pose.

Jake Kring-Schreifels
The Film Stage
Paul Greengrass has such a natural feel for depicting disaster––the kind of kinetic, high-stakes action that keeps moving and escalating and pivoting––that it’s easy to forget how few directors get it right.
