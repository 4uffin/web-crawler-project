Helen O'Hara
Empire Magazine
The fire scenes are terrifying and may well sear themselves into your brain, but however well-intentioned, the human element is less involving than the disaster they must endure.
Rated: 3/5

Matt Donato
AV Club
Drama comes first, the script shoving guilt-ridden parental tropes down your throat, but Greengrass never allows it to snuff out the overwhelming environmental fury on display.
Rated: 3.5/5

Robbie Collin
Daily Telegraph (UK)
As well as a return to the style of Captain Phillips, The Lost Bus proves to be Greengrass’s finest film since: a story of human resilience in the direst of straits, with an unflinchingly human focus.
Rated: 5/5

Shadows on the Wall
Filmmaker Paul Greengrass adds a restless authenticity to this true-life thriller that makes it unusually gripping, putting the audience right in the middle of the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history.
Rated: 4/5

Shot cinema verité style, The Lost Bus’s story of heroism amid the burning inferno of the 2018 California Camp Fire is an intense, you-are-there experience.

Collider
The Lost Bus may not reach the heights of some of Greengrass' finest work, but that's a high bar to reach. The latest film from Apple TV+ rises above its shortcomings, resulting in a gripping docudrama that is worthy of your time.
Rated: 7/10

I recently watched The Lost Bus and decided to share my thoughts here on https://salalahoman22.com.
From the very beginning, the film pulls you into its mysterious atmosphere. The story blends suspense and psychological tension in a way that keeps you engaged, especially as the main character goes through a powerful journey from fear to confrontation.
Visually, the movie stands out with its dark tones, clever use of shadows, and tight camera angles that make you feel trapped inside the bus yourself. The soundtrack also adds a lot to the mood—sometimes quiet, sometimes intense, but always fitting.
On the downside, a few parts felt a little slow, and certain plot twists were somewhat predictable. Still, these moments didn’t take away too much from the overall experience.
In short, The Lost Bus is definitely worth watching if you enjoy mystery and psychological thrillers. I’d personally give it 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5. It’s not about nonstop action—it’s about atmosphere, tension, and a story that makes you think.
