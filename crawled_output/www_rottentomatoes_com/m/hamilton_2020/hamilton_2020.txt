Entertainment Weekly
On film, Hamilton feels every bit as fresh, invigorating, intoxicating, and revolutionary as it did when it premiered five years ago.

NOW Toronto
In a single song, Renee Elise Goldsberry shows off a range between Monica's vocals and Lauryn Hill's rhyme skills. Goldsberry drops the most exhilarating performance I've seen all year.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
The dramatic themes here are big and eternal, and the way history played them out gives them a powerful thump.
Rated: 5/5

I have rarely seen a recording of a stage musical capture the scale and electricity of a live performance, but “Hamilton” comes the closest.

All these ideas and issues are conveyed even more powerfully on film than watching it in a theater...

The phenomena that's been the topic of conversation for the past few years is a must watch. Friendly reminder on why Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.

I loved, loved, loved this movie. I am a Hamilton fan. I've seen the stage show twice at Playhouse Square, in 2015 and 2025. I saw it when it was released on Disney+. And now on the big screen. I feel this movie was my favorite. It was the original cast and was larger than life.

My daughter has loved Hamilton since she performed
It in 8th grade. Shes watched it on Disney+ numerous times. Unfortunately I could never afford to take her to an actual performance so this is the next best thing. And it being the 10th anniversary just made it better.

It was the next best thing to being in the ACTUAL room where it happened 10 years ago. Best time I’ve ever had at the movie theater in my entire life. The whole audience danced and sang and clapped. It was awesome. Thank you, Lin.
