Look around, look around at how beautifully Hamilton shines beyond Broadway - and at how marvelously Thomas Kail captures the stage show's infectious energy.

Entertainment Weekly
On film, Hamilton feels every bit as fresh, invigorating, intoxicating, and revolutionary as it did when it premiered five years ago.

In a single song, Renee Elise Goldsberry shows off a range between Monica's vocals and Lauryn Hill's rhyme skills. Goldsberry drops the most exhilarating performance I've seen all year.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
The dramatic themes here are big and eternal, and the way history played them out gives them a powerful thump.
Rated: 5/5

I have rarely seen a recording of a stage musical capture the scale and electricity of a live performance, but ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù comes the closest.

All these ideas and issues are conveyed even more powerfully on film than watching it in a theater...

The phenomena that's been the topic of conversation for the past few years is a must watch. Friendly reminder on why Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.

Best for younger generations who understand rap, etc. Tediously long and repetitious. Difficult to hear and understand singing. Excellent choreography, performances, and set design.
