Entertainment Weekly
On film, Hamilton feels every bit as fresh, invigorating, intoxicating, and revolutionary as it did when it premiered five years ago.

In a single song, Renee Elise Goldsberry shows off a range between Monica's vocals and Lauryn Hill's rhyme skills. Goldsberry drops the most exhilarating performance I've seen all year.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
The dramatic themes here are big and eternal, and the way history played them out gives them a powerful thump.
Rated: 5/5

I have rarely seen a recording of a stage musical capture the scale and electricity of a live performance, but “Hamilton” comes the closest.

All these ideas and issues are conveyed even more powerfully on film than watching it in a theater...

The phenomena that's been the topic of conversation for the past few years is a must watch. Friendly reminder on why Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.

This was just wonderful. Having seen the print play a number of times, it was still absolutely thrilling and in some ways better because you have the best seat in the house with this movie.

Hamilton was everything I thought it would be and so much more! I am glad it finally made it to the big screen so I could enjoy it in its entirety and be a part of the experience.

Loved it.
Great singing and dancing.
I saw it on Broadway with the original cast in 2015 so I was really excited to see it again.
