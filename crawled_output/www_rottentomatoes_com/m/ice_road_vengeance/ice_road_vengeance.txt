Clint Worthington

For being an ostensible sequel, “Ice Road: Vengeance” features zero ice roads. In fact, writer-director Jonathan Hensleigh’s follow-up barely stands apart from any of the other baker’s dozen punch-em-ups Neeson has led in the last decade.
Rated: 1.5/4

Destined to be quickly forgotten even by fans of its predecessor, Ice Road: Vengeance proves as generic as its title.

The film’s existence seems to rely on a bet that someone out there was dying to see a few more minutes of Gurty flashbacks. If that’s you, you’re in for a great weekend at the movies.

Ice Road: Vengeance is soooo great. What an amazing movie. It should win some Oscars. That’s Irish sarcasm.

The Times of India
The script is thin, the performances hover around average, and the CGI often looks unfinished. Yet, there’s a simplicity to it that works in spurts.

The film forces you to put logic aside and enjoy a parade of action scenes full of clichés. [Full review in Spanish]

Just Horrible... From how they fixed the axel on the broken bus, to the overall script. Someone actually read this script and gave $$$ to make it

It's just absolutely unbelievable.
Plot is right up there with porn scripts.

Generic as they come.
Save yourself the time unless you like making fun of movies.
The positive is the actors aren't at fault.
All do what they can, with what they are given, except one.
Another positive is there is bus intermission in the middle of the movie.
Go grab some snacks and hit the loo and the bus will be back up and running.
Unless you are a big MacGyver fan.

I can’t believe I wasted 1 hour 52 minutes of my time watching this piece of garbage. I had to write this review, I had never taken the time to write a review before, but I could not hold myself. I am actually amazed by whoever directed this piece of garbage approved it to be released. I know Liam has done some work that can be considered mediocre at best, but this is beyond.
