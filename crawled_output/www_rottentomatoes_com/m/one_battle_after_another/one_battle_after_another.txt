New York Post
“Battle” is simultaneously a marathon and a sprint. At the end I wasn’t tired -- I was out of breath.
Rated: 3.5/4

Time Out
From start to finish, One Battle After Another is a mighty 162 minutes of danger, comedy, excitement, love, sex and confusion.
Rated: 5/5

George Simpson
Daily Express (UK)
Accompanied by a fast-paced, scatty score from Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, with gorgeous VistaVision visuals, One Battle After Another is a solid, but not hugely accessible, outing from Anderson.
Rated: 4/5
