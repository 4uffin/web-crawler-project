At 59, Mike Flynt may be too old to be on a college football field, but not too old to feel the weight of unfinished business. After nearly four decades, he returns to his alma mater to take the hit that changed everything. Bruised, doubted, and nearly broken, he pushes for one more game, not for glory, but for the teammates he lost, the family he fractured, and the ending he still believes is possible.

The Hollywood Reporter
The familiar beats are hammered so skillfully you don’t mind the manipulation. And although you may be shocked, shocked, to learn that the film takes some liberties with the truth, they’re not so egregious as to diminish its overall impact.

Some opening narration in The Senior states that this story isn't actually about football, and screenwriter Robert Eisele wisely keeps that promise.

Offers a truly inspirational story that any male of a certain age – football fan or not – should appreciate.

Where “The Senior” earns its bona fides is with Chiklis’s ability to make us feel vested in Mike’s quest to banish the demons that have plagued him for far too long.

Reel Talk with Chuck and Pam
Competently rendered but containing nary a surprise, “The Senior” is the sort of family fare taken in on a weekend afternoon, one that will be generate positive feelings around the dinner table and a bit of inspiration for all.
Rated: 2/4

Except for Chickles, the acting was on par with a high school play. writing was also weak and predictable. This doesn't come even close to the classic "Rudy".
wait for it on VOD, when its $5.99...

Went with a work group for a lunch. However, I was as completely unprepared for the feelings that emerged while watching this film. The acting and directing gave me the feeling of being a part of the film itself. Taking the family to watch it again.

The Senior is an excellent sports movie starring Michael Chickalis as Mike Flynt who plays college football at the age of 59. Mary Stuart Masterton plays his wife and both Mike and Mary turn in very good performances. It's a very moving drama for the whole family.

Take your family and go see this! I was blown away. I loved the fact that this is a true story that inspires you to achieve anything - nothing is impossible. Chiklis is unstoppable and anchors a great ensemble.

BadNews R
The Senior is a movie about a 59-year-old man who wants to recapture his glory days after missing his senior year of college, returning to play football again alongside a younger generation. But there’s a catch: his wife gives him an ultimatum—if he goes back, he must also finish his degree.
This has all the markings of a typical Angel Studios film. Their projects usually land somewhere in the middle: heartfelt, well-intentioned, sometimes inspiring, but often lacking depth and cohesion. On the performance side, though, Michael Chiklis does an incredible job as Mr. Fliynt. He’s easily the heart of the film, bringing both grit and vulnerability to his role.
The movie sprinkles in flashbacks to give us glimpses of the life he lived and the struggles he endured. These are powerful at times, but they don’t dig deep enough. It’s the same with his son—there’s a lot of talk about how the son endured the same kind of mental abuse, and while the emotional disconnect is mentioned, we never actually see it play out in a way that feels fully fleshed out. The groundwork is there, but the follow-through is missing.
Angel Studios, as always, knows how to tug at heartstrings. They find just enough moments to make you tear up, even if the overall storytelling falls short. But here’s the recurring problem: their films are often marketed as faith-based or “Jesus-centered,” and The Senior barely touches that territory. There’s a Bible shown early on, picked up briefly by the wife as a memento of his father, and then it vanishes from the story completely. That’s it. Jesus is present for 1.2 seconds, and then gone. For a studio branded around Christian storytelling, it’s a major letdown and feels more like a marketing ploy than genuine faith integration.
Beyond that, the film leaves plot holes. Did he finish his degree? Did he reconcile with his son in any meaningful way beyond words? What about his other children, who appear suddenly at the end after the football game—did they experience the same dynamic, or were they spared? None of these questions are answered.
On a broader level, the film leans heavily into football to drive its energy, but even then it underdelivers. You see him on the field twice outside of practice sequences, which makes the payoff anticlimactic. The story wants to celebrate his return to the game, but the execution doesn’t give us enough football to feel it.
At the end of the day, The Senior is watchable and even enjoyable in bursts. It’s based on a true story, and you can respect that. But in terms of filmmaking, it’s uneven. It avoids the faith element almost entirely, leaves glaring holes in the family story, and doesn’t maximize the sports angle the way it should. People will gravitate to it because of football and Michael Chiklis’s strong performance—but it feels incomplete, like a film that wanted to be inspiring but never fully committed to its own themes.
Final Verdict: A heartfelt story with an excellent lead performance, but bogged down by missed opportunities, weak faith elements, and incomplete storytelling.
