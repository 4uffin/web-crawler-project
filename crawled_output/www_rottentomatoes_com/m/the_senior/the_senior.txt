At 59, Mike Flynt may be too old to be on a college football field, but not too old to feel the weight of unfinished business. After nearly four decades, he returns to his alma mater to take the hit that changed everything. Bruised, doubted, and nearly broken, he pushes for one more game, not for glory, but for the teammates he lost, the family he fractured, and the ending he still believes is possible.

No surprises here, but nobody really wants surprises in a fact-based underdog comeback story. What we want is stakes, a flawed but sympathetic hero, and maybe a bit of wish fulfillment for anyone who’d like a do-over. On those, it crosses the goal line.
Rated: 3/4

You can simply surrender yourself to the bland moral lessons of the movie, but even then, it’s hard not to feel like this was best left as a quirky human interest segment on a slow news day.

The Hollywood Reporter
The familiar beats are hammered so skillfully you don’t mind the manipulation. And although you may be shocked, shocked, to learn that the film takes some liberties with the truth, they’re not so egregious as to diminish its overall impact.

The Senior tells Mike Flynt's remarkable true story of overcoming significant personal failings and childhood trauma to become a man of devout Christian faith. His football journey reminds us that positive change is possible at any age.
Rated: 3/5

The Senior rests squarely on the shoulders of Michael Chiklis as Mike. The role is both physically and emotionally challenging, and Chiklis is up for the task.

Its an interesting story. I like football. Im about his age. I wish they had gone more into the relationship between him and his dad, but it was still a very good movie.

The movie was done very well. It was interesting and emotional. It explores family dysfunctionality.
