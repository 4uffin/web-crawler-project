At 59, Mike Flynt may be too old to be on a college football field, but not too old to feel the weight of unfinished business. After nearly four decades, he returns to his alma mater to take the hit that changed everything. Bruised, doubted, and nearly broken, he pushes for one more game, not for glory, but for the teammates he lost, the family he fractured, and the ending he still believes is possible.

The Hollywood Reporter
The familiar beats are hammered so skillfully you don’t mind the manipulation. And although you may be shocked, shocked, to learn that the film takes some liberties with the truth, they’re not so egregious as to diminish its overall impact.

Charles Koplinski
Reel Talk with Chuck and Pam
Competently rendered but containing nary a surprise, “The Senior” is the sort of family fare taken in on a weekend afternoon, one that will be generate positive feelings around the dinner table and a bit of inspiration for all.
Rated: 2/4

Pure cornball... and pure heart. This true story of a grandpa who returned to play college football is an old-fashioned sports flick with a touch of that old time religion.
Rated: 4/5

AMFM Magazine
Michael Chiklis is perfect casting as an almost dead ringer for Mike Flynt and really sells the part in an already unbelievable story. It’s the beginning of football season and a great way to kickoff the weekend with the whole family.
Rated: 8/10
