Everyone's favorite felons are back, and this time, they've got company. In the new action-packed chapter from DreamWorks Animation's acclaimed comedy smash about a crackerjack crew of animal outlaws, our now-reformed Bad Guys are trying (very, very hard) to be good, but instead find themselves hijacked into a high-stakes, globe-trotting heist, masterminded by a new team of criminals they never saw coming: The Bad Girls.

While it doesn’t quite recapture the spark of surprise that made the first outing such a pleasant detour from franchise fatigue, it still delivers where it counts.
Rated: 3/4

The Bad Guys 2 is no masterpiece — the filmmakers are more enamored with fart-in-a-spacesuit gags than even most kids are likely to be — but it is goofy fun.

Yes, it gets complicated, as these things do. But never so tangled that you lose the thread.

… focuses more on style over substance, the action is beautifully rendered, the characters are funnier than ever, and the way it balances mirth with legitimate kid-friendly thrills is impressive.

it’s a slick film that should appeal to the whole family, even if it is a bit overblown

A good, satisfying family movie. Definitely geared more towards a younger audience but still an enjoyable watch for all ages.

This was a really enjoyable, action packed animation that is great for adults and kids alike. The plot is interesting without being overly complicated and the characters are unforgettable. You'll be on the edge of your seat and almost cheering in the aisles.
