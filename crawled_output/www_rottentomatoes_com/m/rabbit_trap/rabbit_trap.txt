Darcy (Dev Patel) and Daphne (Rosy McEwen) Davenport are freshly decamped from London and taking up residence in an isolated cottage deep in the Welsh countryside in search of creative renewal and acoustic inspiration. When the couple set about exploring their new environs, recording instruments in tow, Darcy stumbles upon a "faerie circle" that emits a strange, unidentifiable frequency; this odd discovery is followed closely by the appearance of an otherworldly child (Jade Croot) who claims to live nearby and is eager to befriend the Davenports. Soon the child becomes a fixture in their household, alternately ingratiating himself and raising suspicions, and exposing unacknowledged rifts and unexamined secrets that threaten to wreak psychological and spiritual havoc in the lives of his makeshift adoptive parents.

There’s so little substance underlying the suspense that when you finally get your “aha” answers, you’re left wondering why you came into the woods in the first place.

It’s when the film plays in the gaps between sound and image that it’s most disturbing.

An immersive sensory experience with just enough atmosphere to gloss over the significant gaps in its storytelling.
Rated: 3/5

Even though Celtic folkore permeates the story, because the meaning of the metaphor is unclear, it is another case of unsatisfying psychological horror for those looking for a story as substantial as its visuals.

Common Sense Media
Focusing on acoustics and the world of natural (and supernatural) sounds, this British folk horror starts with great promise, but quickly loses its way in an atmosphere-soaked but blurry plot.
Rated: 2/5
