Critics Consensus
Animated with infectious energy and vibrant colors, KPop Demon Hunters is jaunty family entertainment with a terrific soundtrack to boot.

Sam Jennings
New Statesman
The most disturbing element of Demon Hunters is the subtle message that keeps poking through its bright, frenetic surface: that there’s nothing wrong, or even essentially exploitative, about contemporary fame.

Kelechi Ehenulo
Empire Magazine
An animated film showing you “how it’s done, done, done” — as HUNTR/X would put it — this is a stunning musical treat, a joy for all ages. Now warm up the vocal cords and bring on the sequel.
Rated: 4/5

Alonso Duralde
The Film Verdict
Probably the year’s funniest animated feature, from the interactions between the three distinct personalities of our heroines to the portrayal of over-the-top fandom.

Mel Campbell
ABC Radio (Australia)
Animation is better than live action at capturing that slick, intense, fetishistic glamour of Kpop, lingering on details like a fan's eye does … but then [the film] uses a looser comic style to express how unhinged the fans' big emotional reactions are.

Michael Medved
The Michael Medved Show
Despite all the acclaim, it's really not very good, with overwrought hammy vocal performances, bizarrely but artfully drawn characters, and a plot that combines predictability with some feeble attempts at profundity.
Rated: 2/4

It was quite enjoyable to see on the big screen my only irritation was that since people were saying the lines from the movie throughout most of the movie not just the songs. Other than that it was an enjoyable time
