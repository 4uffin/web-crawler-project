Kelechi Ehenulo
Empire Magazine
An animated film showing you ‚Äúhow it‚Äôs done, done, done‚Äù ‚Äî as HUNTR/X would put it ‚Äî this is a stunning musical treat, a joy for all ages. Now warm up the vocal cords and bring on the sequel.
Rated: 4/5

The Film Verdict
Probably the year‚Äôs funniest animated feature, from the interactions between the three distinct personalities of our heroines to the portrayal of over-the-top fandom.

Arizona Republic
Not everything will make perfect sense. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs supposed to. It isn‚Äôt the kind of movie where you nitpick the details. It‚Äôs the kind of movie where you float along from one scene to the next, buoyed by catchy hits.
Rated: 3.5/5

Michael Medved
The Michael Medved Show
Despite all the acclaim, it's really not very good, with overwrought hammy vocal performances, bizarrely but artfully drawn characters, and a plot that combines predictability with some feeble attempts at profundity.
Rated: 2/4

Dazzling animation, catchy tunes and a family-friendly message about self-acceptance? What more could you ask for?
