Sam Jennings
New Statesman
The most disturbing element of Demon Hunters is the subtle message that keeps poking through its bright, frenetic surface: that there‚Äôs nothing wrong, or even essentially exploitative, about contemporary fame.

Kelechi Ehenulo
Empire Magazine
An animated film showing you ‚Äúhow it‚Äôs done, done, done‚Äù ‚Äî as HUNTR/X would put it ‚Äî this is a stunning musical treat, a joy for all ages. Now warm up the vocal cords and bring on the sequel.
Rated: 4/5

Alonso Duralde
The Film Verdict
Probably the year‚Äôs funniest animated feature, from the interactions between the three distinct personalities of our heroines to the portrayal of over-the-top fandom.

Michael Medved
The Michael Medved Show
Despite all the acclaim, it's really not very good, with overwrought hammy vocal performances, bizarrely but artfully drawn characters, and a plot that combines predictability with some feeble attempts at profundity.
Rated: 2/4

Dazzling animation, catchy tunes and a family-friendly message about self-acceptance? What more could you ask for?
