Honey Don't!
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Disparate parts and desperate measures spell defeat for Ethan Coen this time around in a romp that tries to cast a wide net but will ultimately leave audiences saying, Honey Don't.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The visually striking and daring cast earns Honey, Don’t! a few watchability points -- even if it’s buried in a messy heap of stylish violence.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
One of those movies, like Super Bad, in which the title reviews the film.

Helen O'Hara
Empire Magazine
There are colourful characters and cool moments to keep you entertained on the road to nowhere, but they can’t disguise the fact that this is a shaggy-dog story with no real point.

Should have worked, but didn’t – that could be the tagline for “Honey Don’t!”

Casey's Movie Mania
Margaret Qualley's vibrant performance shines in Ethan Coen's uneven, though colourful vignette-style neo-noir comedy.

Coen has gone back to his happy place but this time he’s not taken the audience with him.

Mr. Hollywood
Pointless.
Seems like Coen instead of The Coen Brothers cant make a good movie alone. Back to back misfires. Not sure if its his fault or Tricia Cooke (his wife who wrote his last movie as well that wasnt good Drive Away Dolls) but its a definite skip.
He needs to stop working with your wife and go back to making movies with his brother!
