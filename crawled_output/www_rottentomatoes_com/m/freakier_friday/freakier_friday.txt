Freakier Friday
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Freakier Friday doesn't reinvent the original's story so much as it swaps the formula around for a frothy good time, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan easily slipping back into roles that fit them like mixed-and-matched gloves.

Audience Says
TGIFF! Steeped in nostalgia and bursting with good, clean fun, Freakier Friday is a heartfelt celebration of family, with Curtis and Lohan serving up all the cozy, freaky feels.

Girl Culture (Substack)
Far from a perfect movie and definitely a little overlong. But also so earnest and well-intentioned that it papered over a lot of the flaws.
Rated: B-

funny and charming ... a film that deserves to be seen with a crowd—and a friend, mom, or sister.

This setup provides a showcase for Curtis’ unique charm when she’s portraying a teenager trapped in the body of an older woman. The iconic actress gives voice to the horrors of aging ... and she’s having the time of her life doing it.

It’s the rare sequel that embraces three generations, updating the formula with wit, heart, and rhythm.

It was a fairly fun and innocent ride with people who were pretty easy to watch. I laughed out loud several times.

I thoroughly enjoy this movie. I love that it had 4 people who switched bodies instead of the traditional 2. Kudos to the great acting! Jamie you are still going strong!

The dialogue between the characters was quite amusing. But the acting was subpar by most of the cast and the storyline was completely predictable.
