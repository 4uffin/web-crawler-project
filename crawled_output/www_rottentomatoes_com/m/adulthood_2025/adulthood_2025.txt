Mashable
If you're seeking something funky, funny, and charmingly chaotic, Adulthood delivers.

Michael Rechtshaffen
The Hollywood Reporter
While Kaya Scodelario, Josh Gad and a cast of colorful characters keep it all reasonably engaging, the film... falls short of reaching its full potential.

It’s this continuous escalation of malfeasance that gives 'Adulthood' its wicked tempo and disquieting thrills.
Rated: 3/4

Jim Vorel
Paste Magazine
There are enough moments of either well-calculated gallows humor or generational commentary to keep things moving briskly along, and both Gad and Scodelario find room to have a new definition of maturity thrust upon them.
Rated: 6.9/10

Shawn Van Horn
Collider
Adulthood is a film with three-dimensional people who are good for some laughs due to their reactions, but the surrounding plot is high-stakes and filled with suspense.
Rated: 7/10

Jason Gorber
Next Best Picture
Who knows how “Adulthood” will age, but if you’re looking for a brisk bout of debauchery and family shenanigans, Alex Winter’s latest chilly tale may well be something to be warmed by.
Rated: 6/10
