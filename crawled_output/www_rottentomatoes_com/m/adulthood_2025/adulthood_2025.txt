If you're seeking something funky, funny, and charmingly chaotic, Adulthood delivers.

The Hollywood Reporter
While Kaya Scodelario, Josh Gad and a cast of colorful characters keep it all reasonably engaging, the film... falls short of reaching its full potential.

It’s this continuous escalation of malfeasance that gives 'Adulthood' its wicked tempo and disquieting thrills.
Rated: 3/4

Next Best Picture
Who knows how “Adulthood” will age, but if you’re looking for a brisk bout of debauchery and family shenanigans, Alex Winter’s latest chilly tale may well be something to be warmed by.
Rated: 6/10

Shelagh Rowan-Legg
ScreenAnarchy
Starting from a great premise and having two actors who make their characters and the relationship work is the key to Adulthood's dark humour and how an audience, especially those of us with siblings and elderly parents, can relate to them.
Rated: 3/5
