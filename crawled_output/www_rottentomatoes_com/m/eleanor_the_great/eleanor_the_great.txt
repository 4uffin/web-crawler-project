What to Know
Critics Consensus
Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut may have the pitfalls of an unsteady visionary, but this ultimately uneven caper is greatly amplified by June Squibb's exquisite performance.

Slant Magazine
Scarlett Johansson’s direction keeps things simple and intimate in a way that Tory Kamen’s overambitious screenplay doesn’t.
Rated: 2.5/4

The film never quite recovers from the moral issue at its center, Squibb’s lively performance makes it memorable.
Rated: 2.5/4

Kristen Lopez
The Film Maven
This was a heartfelt, emotionally resonant story about the power of our lives and the capacity of our stories lingering on long after we've left this world. Take someone you love and see it.
Rated: B

Nerdspin
At first glance, Eleanor the Great could be seen as a story of deception, but Johansson crafts something far more profound. It’s a meditation on grief, friendship, and the quiet ways people cope with unbearable loss.
Rated: A

Flickering Myth
Eleanor the Great is a poignant and moving film with Squibb giving one of the best performances of her long career.
Rated: 5/5

Film Festival Today
There’s nothing funny about betrayal of this magnitude, nor about cosplaying a victim of the Nazis.
Rated: 2.5/5
