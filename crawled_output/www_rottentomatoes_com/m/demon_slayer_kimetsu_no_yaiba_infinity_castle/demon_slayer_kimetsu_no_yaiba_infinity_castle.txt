Tanjiro Kamado -- a boy who joined an organization dedicated to hunting down demons called the Demon Slayer Corps after his younger sister Nezuko was turned into a demon. While growing stronger and deepening his friendships and bonds with fellow corps members, Tanjiro has battled many demons with his comrades -- Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Along the way, his journey has led him to fight alongside the Demon Slayer Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, the Hashira, including Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku aboard the Mugen Train, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui within the Entertainment District, as well as Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji at the Swordsmith Village. As the Demon Slayer Corps members and Hashira engaged in a group strength training program, the Hashira Training, in preparation for the forthcoming battle against the demons, Muzan Kibutsuji appears at the Ubuyashiki Mansion. With the head of the Demon Corps in danger, Tanjiro and the Hashira rush to the headquarters but are plunged into a deep descent to a mysterious space by the hands of Muzan Kibutsuji. The destination of where Tanjiro and Demon Slayer Corps have fallen is the demons' stronghold -- the Infinity Castle. And so, the battleground is set as the final battle between the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons ignites.

Variety
Beyond the sheer inventiveness of the movie’s made-up martial arts, that leaves the tragic elements, which can be disarmingly effective in giving audiences reason to feel invested in the battles -- battles that have only just begun.

While the plot is simple, the visual imagery and the emotions are complex.

From intricate backgrounds to propulsive fight choreography, everything is vividly rendered to perfection. Infinity Castle really looks like it belongs on the big screen. The problem is that it feels like it belongs on the small screen in some key aspects
Rated: B-

The Demon Slayer story is reaching its end with a film that feels more like several TV episodes coming together than anything else, making it a bit too long.

I am not an anime fan and only went to see the movie because of my 16 year old daughter. However, I do know the backstory of the characters and who they are. Even with my not liking anime, I enjoyed the movie. I do feel like the fight scenes were LONG but the story was really enthralling actually. It is definitely worth watching foe everyone but DEFINITELY if you are into anime even a little bit.

Great anime film following up the Hashira training arc in the Demon Slayer series. Great animation, and fight sequences. Although my one criticism was with the frequent (like every minute) there was a 10-20 second flash backs in the fight with the 2nd upper moon and 6th upper moon there was a need more concise direction for these two fights to avoid constant interruption of short flashbacks.

This is by far the most exciting and the most visually stunning installment of this whole story yet. Even though there are quite a few flashback scenes, they are all vital to moving the story forward.
It can be quite loud and visually chaotic at times, so the R rating is very true to form. Older children shouldnt have an issue viewing this film with parental supervision. Definitely a must see on the big screen. And, if you can stomach it, definitely something to see in IMAX.
