Tanjiro Kamado -- a boy who joined an organization dedicated to hunting down demons called the Demon Slayer Corps after his younger sister Nezuko was turned into a demon. While growing stronger and deepening his friendships and bonds with fellow corps members, Tanjiro has battled many demons with his comrades -- Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Along the way, his journey has led him to fight alongside the Demon Slayer Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, the Hashira, including Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku aboard the Mugen Train, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui within the Entertainment District, as well as Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji at the Swordsmith Village. As the Demon Slayer Corps members and Hashira engaged in a group strength training program, the Hashira Training, in preparation for the forthcoming battle against the demons, Muzan Kibutsuji appears at the Ubuyashiki Mansion. With the head of the Demon Corps in danger, Tanjiro and the Hashira rush to the headquarters but are plunged into a deep descent to a mysterious space by the hands of Muzan Kibutsuji. The destination of where Tanjiro and Demon Slayer Corps have fallen is the demons' stronghold -- the Infinity Castle. And so, the battleground is set as the final battle between the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons ignites.

Variety
Beyond the sheer inventiveness of the movieâ€™s made-up martial arts, that leaves the tragic elements, which can be disarmingly effective in giving audiences reason to feel invested in the battles -- battles that have only just begun.

While the plot is simple, the visual imagery and the emotions are complex.

From intricate backgrounds to propulsive fight choreography, everything is vividly rendered to perfection. Infinity Castle really looks like it belongs on the big screen. The problem is that it feels like it belongs on the small screen in some key aspects
Rated: B-

The Demon Slayer story is reaching its end with a film that feels more like several TV episodes coming together than anything else, making it a bit too long.

First and last time doing a 4DX movie until it improves 100x.
Demon Slayer was great but the flash backs mid fight really took away from the action. One of them being far to long! I do appreciate a good flash back to understand some backstory of characters but don't like it during an intense battle scene. I really hope the next movie puts them in at the correct time and limits the amount of time they have on the big screen.

I went to go see this movie on 9/17 so the last day at my location and my hopes were sky high, and when I went go see it my expectations were excited. the animation was fantastic, the fight scene's were everything I hoped for and more, and the backstory's were nice but sad, me personally I would give this movie a 9/10, the only think keep this movie a 10/10 in my opinion was the backstory's being a-bit too long, and don't get me wrong I understand a backstory is extremely important but they over stayed there welcome for me, but I could not recommend this movie enough, and I will definitely say I will be seeing the other two... when they come out.
