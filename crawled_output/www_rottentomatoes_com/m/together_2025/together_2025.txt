Together
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Given an extra sinew of authenticity by the metatextual casting of Alison Brie and Dave Franco at the top of their game, Together is a body horror that's as emotionally sticky as it is memorably gnarly.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Surging with chemistry from the leads, Together fuses the bizarre with the perturbed, crafting its own sort of alchemy that feels wholly original.

Sight & Sound
The metaphor of attachment finally isn’t just about visualising co-dependence; what gets under your skin is Tim and Millie’s fear that they’re forgetting how to be close at all.

Mashable
Because of all the Sundance buzz, even as I watched Together's supremely gruesome climax, I was a bit bereft, hungering for something more.

Kevin Maher
The Times (UK)
The beauty of the film and of the screenplay from... writer-director Michael Shanks is that it’s an unforgiving dissection of co-dependent romantic relationships as well as a giddy and frequently stomach-churning scream-at-the-screen body horror.
Rated: 4/5

The premise may sound rather ridiculous, whimsical, and arbitrary, but writer-director Shanks sustains it with equal doses of dark humor and terrifying visual effects. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 3.5/5

Paula Vázquez Prieto
La Nación (Argentina)
...there is no worse curse than literally joining another person...That seems to be the warning, in a somewhat unbalanced mix of horror and comedy that director Michael Shanks attempts in his playful exercise in body horror. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 3/5

Together is more for audiences who aren't addicted to horror. It's like an appetizer, a way to begin to understand its rules and then decide whether or not to embrace the genre. [Full review in Spanish]

Definitely a must-see movie.
The action and plot twists will keep you engaged from start to finish.
Really a roller-coaster of excitement with pretty good special effects and beautiful cinematography.

What a piece of poo poo. The movie stunk to high heaven. The editing sucked. The storyline sucked.
The best part of my adventure to the movies was stopping off at hooters
