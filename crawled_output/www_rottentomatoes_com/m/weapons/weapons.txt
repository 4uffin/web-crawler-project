Weapons
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Zach Cregger spins an expertly crafted yarn of terrifying mystery and thrilling intrigue in Weapons, a sophomore triumph that solidifies his status as a master of horror.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Loaded with bold elements that make it not just a great horror film, but a noteworthy film overall, Weapons is ultimately an impressive, genre-bending experience that’s original, entertaining, and satisfying despite its faint air of ambiguity.

Bill Goodykoontz
Arizona Republic
This is definitely a horror movie, increasingly by the minute. It’s also really funny — in places — and the finale combines horror and comedy in a way that doesn’t cheapen either one.
Rated: 4.5/5

Justin Chang
NPR
Zach Cregger's ingenious and exultant new horror film is like a Stephen King riff on The Pied Piper of Hamelin, and it has a wonderful campfire-tale spookiness.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
It's a smorgasbord. It is a full meal of stuff and it doesn't all work, but there is enough in there that is genuinely kind of 'Oh Gosh!'...

John Serba
Decider
Cregger treads oh-so-carefully when it means it most, drawing an exquisite, everything’s-not-quite-all-right kind of non-conclusion that feels like the stuff of a true story.

Over-exposition kills the movie magic. There's no mystery left. Cregger understands that.

Stefania Sarrubba
Screensphere
For a rule-bending mystery elevated by its performances, Weapons disappointingly ends up caving to a dollar-store trope in a rather traditional resolution.
Rated: 3/5

I loved the way the plot was organized and the pacing was outstanding. It felt like once the true mystery of the story was revealed about 3/4 through the movie or so, it stopped being scary. I wish that initial tension was maintained all the way through the rest of the film. 3.5/5
