Phil Walsh
Geek Vibes Nation
Splicing this together with a terrific creature-feature and a cosmic performance by Wilson -- Xeno is a heartwrenching spectacle that goes beyond the usual alien fodder into telling us a story that shows friendships extend beyond the bounds of Earth.
Rated: 8.5/10

There’s a lot here to like and even love, especially when the movie spends time with Croak and Renee, getting to the pure cinematic pleasures of a friendship that develops between inhabitants of different worlds.
Rated: B+

NYC Movie Guru
A mildly engaging and somewhat moving, but uninspired and unimaginative sci-fi adventure.

Alan Ng
Film Threat
Thanks to Lulu Wilson’s heartfelt and gritty performance, along with the chilling alien design from the Jim Henson Creature Shop, the film delivers a bold, engaging story of loss, survival, and an unlikely friendship.
Rated: 8/10
