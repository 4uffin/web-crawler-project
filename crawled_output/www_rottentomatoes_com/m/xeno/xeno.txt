Avi Offer
NYC Movie Guru
A mildly engaging and somewhat moving, but uninspired and unimaginative sci-fi adventure.

Alan Ng
Film Threat
Thanks to Lulu Wilson’s heartfelt and gritty performance, along with the chilling alien design from the Jim Henson Creature Shop, the film delivers a bold, engaging story of loss, survival, and an unlikely friendship.
Rated: 8/10
