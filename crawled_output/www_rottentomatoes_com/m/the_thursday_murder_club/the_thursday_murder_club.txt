Critics Consensus
Cozy as an undemanding beach reach and just as slight, this starry murder mystery leverages its terrific troupe of actors to nostalgic effect.

There is some shock value, but the film goes too far in evading the truth; it nearly forgets to establish an emotional tether between the audience and its suspects.

Sometimes all you need is a nice, safe, and utterly pleasant piece of cinematic diversion that doesn’t insult your intelligence and is made with sturdy, workmanlike competence.

After a charming setup with such a lovely cast it is remarkable just how little they factor in to putting the final pieces together of the mystery which is substantially underwhelming.
Rated: 2/4

The Saturday Evening Post
What could go wrong? Nothing. That doesn’t make (it) a particularly good film. But even in a middling movie, when absolutely everybody in a ridiculously talented company is clicking on all eight cylinders, you’d have to be criminally grouchy to nitpick.
Rated: 3/5

Despite the dazzling stars in good form and the industry heft behind the production, it's only
a moderately entertaining caper

(spoiler) She cuts a deal to let a human trafficker go free while driving her two friends to commit suicide. Awful movie.

Chris Columbus brings The Thursday Murder Club to life with a stacked cast that immediately had me sold—I’m always game for a murder mystery. It’s always a joy to see David Tennant pop up, and while the jokes got a few chuckles out of me, they never really landed hard. The film itself is… fine. Decent but forgettable, with zero real tension or stakes to pull you in. Instead, it plays like a cozy whodunit you half-watch on a lazy Sunday, more mindless entertainment than gripping mystery. Columbus directs with his usual steady hand, but this story probably would’ve been better suited as a miniseries where the characters and twists could actually breathe. Three stars for charm, not thrills.

Enjoyable movie with some laughs. No surprise it was well acted considering the cast. It is exactly what you would expect from this Netflix movie based on the book. Looking forward to a sequel.
