Set against the vibrant backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, Marvel Studios' "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" introduces Marvel's First Family--Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm/Invisible Woman (Vanessa Kirby), Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Joseph Quinn) and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) as they face their most daunting challenge yet. Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson) and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer (Julia Garner). And if Galactus' plan to devour the entire planet and everyone on it weren't bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal.

Audiences shouldn’t have to sacrifice eye-catching stunts and imagery for great writing and acting. They should have it all. Should but won’t in this case.

Fat Guys at the Movies
It’s still a superhero movie, and it connects to the next phase of Marvel crossover films. However, it taps into some real human elements.
Rated: 4/5

Four times the charm and this take on Marvel’ first family doesn’t disappoint. The cast was awesome, the story and setting was great, and the hidden cameo of Stan Lee & Jack Kirby was a nice touch.

It is pretty solid to enjoy a nice little watch, but as a person who grew up with the og fantastic 4. Silver surfer being a woman and galactis was no where near as intimidating as before idk. It was still a very great movie!
