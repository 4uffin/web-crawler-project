Set against the vibrant backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, Marvel Studios' "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" introduces Marvel's First Family--Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm/Invisible Woman (Vanessa Kirby), Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Joseph Quinn) and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) as they face their most daunting challenge yet. Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson) and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer (Julia Garner). And if Galactus' plan to devour the entire planet and everyone on it weren't bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal.

Audiences shouldn’t have to sacrifice eye-catching stunts and imagery for great writing and acting. They should have it all. Should but won’t in this case.

Fat Guys at the Movies
It’s still a superhero movie, and it connects to the next phase of Marvel crossover films. However, it taps into some real human elements.
Rated: 4/5

Watched with our 9 and 7 year olds. Only a couple of super duper tiny things Id prefer them to not see/hear. (And honestly, the didnt even pick up on them.)
Excellent movie! (Ugly cried near the end.)
And, spoiler alert: it all turns out okay.
