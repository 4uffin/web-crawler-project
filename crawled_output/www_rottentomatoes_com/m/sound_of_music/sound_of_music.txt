A tuneful, heartwarming story, it is based on the real life story of the Von Trapp Family singers, one of the world's best-known concert groups in the era immediately preceding World War II. Julie Andrews plays the role of Maria, the tomboyish postulant at an Austrian abbey who becomes a governess in the home of a widowed naval captain with seven children, and brings a new love of life and music into the home.

Critics Consensus
Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.

Whether you enjoy it as a fun family singalong or a moving true story, this classic still bounces along in a tremendously likeable fashion.

It is not a bold, adventuresome motion picture, nor does it advance the art of the film even a trifle. What it is, and this is what the producers must have intended, is tuneful, uncomplicated entertainment, expensively set before the viewer.

The last of the Rodgers-Hammer-stein collaborations, The Sound of Music is the best screen version of their works.

The movie hurts. It stings. Too many simply remember it as some happy-go-lucky singalong, but absolutely not. The Sound of Music breaks your heart.

The Sound of Music may be schmaltz, but it’s irresistible schmaltz.

Of course, it's well done for what it is: that is to say, those who made it are experts at manipulating responses. They're the Pavlovs of moviemaking: they turn us into dogs that salivate on signal.

The movie was fabulous!
It was great seeing it on the Big Screen you get to see details you miss on TV.
We all thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
The theater's atmosphere was great seats were comfortable and both the temperature and sound were just right.
