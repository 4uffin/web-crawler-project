The result is, as with many Netflix documentaries de nos jours, a film that feels, if not one-sided, then not exactly brimming with editorial independence.
Rated: 2/5

I’m sceptical, but then again I always am. If they’re happy, fair play to them. But one must consider the possibility that if they’re as satisfied as they claim, neither they nor we needed a documentary to convince us of it.

This is pure garbage, built on the egotistical views of the "Shaman" Durek.
It is disrespectful to everyone but themselves, and is ultimately a very one-sided story that should have been shelved when the Royal Family of Norway didn't want to participate.

A terrible documentary being a product of both Netflix and the couple trying make some easy money. Instead of going into details just belive me when I say "Skip it" . It's really not worth your valuable time.

Bjornis B
a one-sided and speculative Netflix documentary that lacks journalistic balance and credibility. Its portrayal of the Norwegian king is particularly problematic. he has, for years, consistently demonstrated an inclusive and respectful approach toward all citizens. Suggesting otherwise not only undermines well-documented public conduct, but also feels unjust and misleading. The documentary leans more toward insinuation than insight.

I have never felt so much pity for people as I felt for the two main characters in Rebel Royals. They are so wrapped up in their own world—and the fact that they even signed a contract to make this film is just heartbreaking. The directors left out many important aspects of the story, or perhaps they simply don’t know them; maybe being American directors, they lacked the contextual understanding of what actually happened in Norway. Either way, there’s a whole lot more to the story than what was presented here. Some of the major accusations made directly or indirectly miss the mark and end up being both disappointing and misleading. I had to turn it off with 40 minutes still remaining—it was just too full of nonsense.
