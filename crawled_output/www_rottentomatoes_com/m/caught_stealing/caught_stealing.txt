Hank Thompson (Austin Butler) was a high-school baseball phenom who can't play anymore, but everything else is going okay. He's got a great girl (Zoë Kravitz), tends bar at a New York dive, and his favorite team is making an underdog run at the pennant. When his punk-rock neighbor Russ (Matt Smith) asks him to take care of his cat for a few days, Hank suddenly finds himself caught in the middle of a motley crew of threatening gangsters. They all want a piece of him; the problem is he has no idea why. As Hank attempts to evade their ever-tightening grip, he's got to use all his hustle to stay alive long enough to find out....

What to Know
Critics Consensus
A freewheeling throwback, Caught Stealing splendidly showcases Austin Butler's movie star charisma while marking a surprisingly lighthearted gearshift for director Darren Aronofsky.

Audience Says
A diverting, pulpy caper with ‘90s flair, Caught Stealing is a gritty, violent ride fueled by the charisma of Austin Butler and Zoë Kravitz.

This is a straightforward, entertaining crime thriller.

AARP Movies for Grownups
Caught Stealing is the best movie from Darren Aronofsky... in years, a crazy After Hours-style yarn with a high body count and a buoyant, breathless pace.
Rated: 4/5

It’s Aronofsky near his best.

Film Ireland Magazine
The action suffers from being too slick to be gritty and too uneven to be truly funny. Still, the playful plot, strong performances and immersive sense of place are enough to enjoy.

Austin Butler takes the lead and runs with it. ... [The film is] diverting enough as a crime story but a more satisfying study of a character caught in the clutch.

Caught Stealing can be set present day or any other time in New York city's checkered history. Sure there's a talk of gentrification, Giuliani and Mets, but no one in the movie seems to be affected by them at all.

It was a blast. Had me in suspense of the grander plot the entire time and held constant tension with the feeling like the stakes just keep getting higher and higher throughout. Fantastic fast paced fun movie.

Wasn’t terrible but didn’t really understand the point of the movie. Overly violent too. Felt like a guy Ritchie knockoff. Attempted witty dialogue and bizarre characters felt contrived.
