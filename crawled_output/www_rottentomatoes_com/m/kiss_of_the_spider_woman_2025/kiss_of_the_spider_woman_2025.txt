Luna and Lopez are great, but this is Tonatiuh's movie -- he takes a role that could easily be a caricature of queer flamboyance and pathos, and grounds it with depth and soul.

Slant Magazine
The musical is lesser Kander and Ebb, to be sure, but it still contains a critique—of the use of art as a form of escapism—that’s barely visible in this adaptation.
Rated: 2/4

Some people will have a very personal response to “Spider Woman” that will smother any criticisms about its lack of visual language, but that doesn’t mean this musical couldn’t have been better.

This new Spider-Woman isn't afraid of visual excesses or theatrical artifice. Quite the contrary: it embraces them as aesthetics and as ideological statements. [Full review in Spanish]

"Kiss of the Spider Woman" will undoubtedly leave you with mixed feelings and a lot of nostalgia for the 1950s. [Full Review in Spanish]

A lively & wonderful film adaptation of the 90s Broadway musical. Diego Luna is fantastic, Tonatiuh is a revelation, and Jennifer Lopez shines brightly in what can only be described as the perfect role. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 3.5/5
