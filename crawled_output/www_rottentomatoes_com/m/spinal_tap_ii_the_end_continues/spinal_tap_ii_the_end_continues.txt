Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

Thankfully, nothing in “Spinal Tap II” will kill off the original’s legacy. It’s just a nostalgia lap you wish had more 11.

The core issue, however, is that it just isn’t very funny.

Spinal Tap II is more touching than it is laugh-out-loud funny.

Movie Madness Podcast
No small task following up one of the best comedies ever but there are still plenty of consistent laughs along with some fun new characters and just enough great cameos to make this reunion more than just another s**t sandwich sequel.
Rated: 3/4

An exercise in wasted potential... To put it in Spinal Tap terms, this one does not go up to eleven.

As far as legacy sequels go. I put Spinal Tap II: The End Continues right next to Happy Gilmore 2.
Take that however you would like.

Not as good as the original (of course!) but amusing nonetheless and the cameos were great!
If you liked the first one, go see this!
