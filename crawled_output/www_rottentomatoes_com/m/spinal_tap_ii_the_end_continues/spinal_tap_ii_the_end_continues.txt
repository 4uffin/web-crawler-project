Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

Boston Globe
It’s not as fall-down funny nor as fresh as the original, but there are enough chuckles and musical performances to make this sequel worth seeing.
Rated: 3/4

The Times (UK)
... it seemingly hopes that the sight of our beloved trio gathered together, mostly on chairs and improvising badly, will be enough in itself. The results, alas, are less The Majesty of Rock and more Shit Sandwich.
Rated: 2/5

Thankfully, nothing in “Spinal Tap II” will kill off the original’s legacy. It’s just a nostalgia lap you wish had more 11.

Reel Reviews
A hilarious encore that plays the hits, tries out a few new riffs, and never loses sight of the joke. It’s a reminder that Spinal Tap, much like rock itself, will never truly fade away—it’ll just keep turning things up to eleven.
Rated: 3/5

Maxance Vincent
The Cosmic Circus
Spinal Tap II is essentially a vehicle for Reiner to tell audiences, “Remember how great This Is Spinal Tap is? How about you watch that instead of wasting your time here!”
Rated: 2.5/5

Tom Shone
Sunday Times (UK)
It’s such a pleasure to be back in the company of Tufnel, Smalls and St Hubbins — older, whiter of whisker but as gormless as ever — that it may be a while before the thinness of the material dawns on you.
Rated: 3/5
