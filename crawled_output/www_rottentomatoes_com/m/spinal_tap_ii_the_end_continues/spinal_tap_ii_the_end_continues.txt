Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

Spinal Tap II is more touching than it is laugh-out-loud funny.

The End Continues feints at rich, elegiac emotions but never quite accesses them.

Slate
Though it never reaches the heights of the original—if that film went to 11, this one tops out at around 7.5—Spinal Tap II also never feels like a soulless cash grab or a betrayal of the first movie’s impish comic spirit.

Adam Sweeting
The Arts Desk
Where This Is… revelled in its role as a guileful satire on a sleazy, feckless rock business and the grotesque and ludicrous personalities that inhabited it, Tap 2 has a sad, autumnal feel, more like a requiem than a celebration or even a demolition.
Rated: 1/5

Shadows on the Wall
Fans of the 1984 original will be in heaven watching this 40-years-later followup, another blissfully dry mock-documentary tracing the contractual reunion concert of the iconic metal band.
Rated: 4.5/5

“Spinal Tap II” doesn’t quite crank it up to 11, but it lands at about, oh, a 6.5.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues might not reach the heights of the original, but it still serves as a fitting encore to the story and characters.

I didn’t think the sequel could come close to the first, but I was wrong. I was laughing out loud.

If youre a fan of the original, youll enjoy this movie. The banter between the three main characters is fun and I really enjoyed the cameos of Elton John and Paul McCartney.
