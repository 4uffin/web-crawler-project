Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

The Times (UK)
... it seemingly hopes that the sight of our beloved trio gathered together, mostly on chairs and improvising badly, will be enough in itself. The results, alas, are less The Majesty of Rock and more Shit Sandwich.

Thankfully, nothing in “Spinal Tap II” will kill off the original’s legacy. It’s just a nostalgia lap you wish had more 11.

The core issue, however, is that it just isn’t very funny.

Sunday Times (UK)
It’s such a pleasure to be back in the company of Tufnel, Smalls and St Hubbins — older, whiter of whisker but as gormless as ever — that it may be a while before the thinness of the material dawns on you.
Rated: 3/5

'Spinal Tap II' isn't uproariously funny, nor particularly edgy, and it will be entirely useless to anyone who is not already a fan, but darned if it isn't rather sweet and pleasant. That's not exactly a metal thing to say, but it's true.
Rated: 3/4

For all those who thoroughly enjoyed the first film, this release is a comedic gift with the same goofiness and irresistible humor that tens of millions previously enjoyed.

You need to have seen the first Spinal Tap movie (This Is Spinal Tap) to really appreciate the new Spinal Tap II: The End Continues. This movie really compliments the first movie and explains what has happened over the last 40 years. It's great to see it come together and keep the same edginess at the same time. All the stars from the first movie return (minus the previous drummers) along with a couple musical superstar icons!
