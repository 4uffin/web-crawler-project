'Looking Through Water' wants to tell us about the importance of uncluttered connections to the natural world and to each other, but too often it ignores its own advice.
Rated: 2.5/4

Collider
This elementary-level approach to stories about fractured families is all well and good if you just want 90 minutes of fluff, but often by design, such setups really require a more serious approach for any real depth to be reached.
Rated: 6/10

This drama has a solid story and will leave viewers who love gentle family stories satisfied enough.

A predictable drama, failing to capture the vulnerability and forgiveness that define better father‚Äìson stories.
Rated: 3/10

‚ÄúLooking Through Water‚Äù could use a bit more energy and intensity, but for those searching for something easy on the senses, the movie might work with its nonconfrontational ways.
Rated: B-

Looking Through Water speaks to the destructive power of holding on to old grudges and resentments as well as the need for open and honest communication in families. It also witnesses to the hope possible when healing is embraced.

Mr. Hollywood
Better than I thought it would be. Felt for the characters. We are all here for a small amount of time and no one is perfect, we all make mistakes that we regret. A film that explains this nicely and tries not to judge

Really enjoyed this well-made heartfelt movie.
It is a good story about family issues, which many can relate to.
David Morse, of course Michael Douglas and his son give great performances.
Generational conflicts as well as those with siblings are issues that make good movies.
It takes a really good film to get people into theaters these days, and this one is wel worth it.

This timely movie addresses the importance and impact of male roll models for boys and young men.
Not just fathers but grandfathers needed influence on younger generations. This film has all the needed elements to keep an audience engaged. Action,Drama, family issues, romance and
personal growth. I particularly loved the no nonsense conversations between the grandfather (Michael Douglas ) and his grandson ( Walker Scobell ) during their day long fishing adventure together. I highly recommend this film to all ages. Great film to watch with the whole family, on a date or alone.
