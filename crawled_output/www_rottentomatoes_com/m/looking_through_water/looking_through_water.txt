'Looking Through Water' wants to tell us about the importance of uncluttered connections to the natural world and to each other, but too often it ignores its own advice.

A predictable drama, failing to capture the vulnerability and forgiveness that define better father–son stories.
Rated: 3/10

“Looking Through Water” could use a bit more energy and intensity, but for those searching for something easy on the senses, the movie might work with its nonconfrontational ways.
Rated: B-

Looking Through Water speaks to the destructive power of holding on to old grudges and resentments as well as the need for open and honest communication in families. It also witnesses to the hope possible when healing is embraced.

An honest, wise and tender emotional journey well worth taking.
Looking Through Water is as powerful, poetic and engrossing as On Golden Pond.

Water’ll teach you things if you let it. Patience. Respect. Fear, too. I’ve spent enough time staring at it to know it doesn’t lie — it shows you who you are when you’d rather not look. That’s what Looking Through Water gets right. It’s not just a story, it’s a mirror. Watching it, I felt the same knots in my gut I’ve felt on long days at sea, when the quiet gets louder than the waves. Now I’ve got to read Bob Rich’s book. If it cuts half as deep as the film, I’m in for something real. This one isn’t just about fishing or family — it’s about finding yourself out there, with nothing but water staring back.

Excellent movie, best use of flashbacks I've seen in a while. All the actors gave strong performances, particularly David Morse and Michael Douglas. Beautiful tropical scenery. An understated elegiac tone. My only quibble would be the teen boy was too abrasive and unrealistically articulate at the outset. Sullen probably would have worked better.

Great movie!
Fantastic scenery, fishing, entertaining, well known actors, take you through sharing family drama in a way to reconnect with those you need most in your life.
With so many of us glued to our electronics these days, we need to be reminded, how a little bit of time and effort can change your whole perspective on your family dynamics.

Beautifully written and produced. Loved the personal interaction between the characters. There was action and
drama and an exciting display of the art of fly fishing. A true tribute to the sport and sportsmanship. Emotionally embracing, I even shed a tear.
Home run on all accounts.
