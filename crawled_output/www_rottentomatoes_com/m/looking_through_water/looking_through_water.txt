'Looking Through Water' wants to tell us about the importance of uncluttered connections to the natural world and to each other, but too often it ignores its own advice.

A predictable drama, failing to capture the vulnerability and forgiveness that define better father–son stories.
Rated: 3/10

“Looking Through Water” could use a bit more energy and intensity, but for those searching for something easy on the senses, the movie might work with its nonconfrontational ways.
Rated: B-

Looking Through Water speaks to the destructive power of holding on to old grudges and resentments as well as the need for open and honest communication in families. It also witnesses to the hope possible when healing is embraced.

An honest, wise and tender emotional journey well worth taking.
Looking Through Water is as powerful, poetic and engrossing as On Golden Pond.

The movie is perfectly cast, the actors all did a great job, David Morse was terrific. Looking Through Water delivers a touching relatable story that takes us through the challenges of family communication, the results of estrangement, and rewards of re-connection and self-discovery. The cinematography is very nice and the direction and editing superb, giving this solid story a good non-labored pace against an attractive backdrop of beautiful authentic locations.

Beautifully filmed. The varied locations support the
storytelling
& dysfunction of the main characters.
The intimacy of the characters sheds light on the
state
of the relationships.
The casting was terrific. The tension btw them was excellent. Filming on water locations is tough but they made it look easy!

A treat for all that love to fish and in this case fly fishing in the blue waters of Belize. The importance of family and the possibility of reconnecting sends a message of hope. Michael Douglas is spot on and the dynasty continues with his son Cameron. Definitely check this one out.
