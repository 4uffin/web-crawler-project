Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale transports you to a time and place that seems so much more glamorous than our own, and to see it all splashed out on the big screen is almost overwhelming. It’s a genteel fantasy worth leaving the couch for.

The main appeal here is the chance to spend time in the company of superb actors who all wear their characters as comfortably as an old silk robe.

"The Grand Finale" goes out not with a bang, but also not with a whimper, but rather a polite wave goodbye.

It seems appropriate that this movie might indeed be the fond heartwarming sendoff it purports to be, content with not overstaying its welcome, to the sad sobbing resignation of its legions of devotees.

This cosy insularity was probably predictable, and It may be what devoted fans want, but I didn’t believe a word of it.
