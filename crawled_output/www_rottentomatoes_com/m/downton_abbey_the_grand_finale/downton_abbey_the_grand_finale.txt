The main appeal here is the chance to spend time in the company of superb actors who all wear their characters as comfortably as an old silk robe.

"The Grand Finale" goes out not with a bang, but also not with a whimper, but rather a polite wave goodbye.
Rated: B-

Globe and Mail
Returning director Simon Curtis still doesn’t solve the television pacing and plotting problem of making a two-hour fan film that doesn’t feel like episodes tacked together, but at least gives each of the extensive beloved cast an arc and some closure.

Films with explosions and a lot of machinations pale in comparison to seemingly sedate storylines that will be exciting to those in the know.

Should I See It
As a casual fan of Downton Abbey, and someone who has seen all three films and worked my way through the series a few years back, I found plenty to enjoy.
Rated: 3.5/5

...this is a comfort-food platter for longtime devotees, like whatever the adult equivalent is of Chickie Nuggies and Choccy Milk served on a silver platter with Grey Poupon and a bouillon spoon.
