Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale transports you to a time and place that seems so much more glamorous than our own, and to see it all splashed out on the big screen is almost overwhelming. It’s a genteel fantasy worth leaving the couch for.

The main appeal here is the chance to spend time in the company of superb actors who all wear their characters as comfortably as an old silk robe.

"The Grand Finale" goes out not with a bang, but also not with a whimper, but rather a polite wave goodbye.
Rated: B-

The film is gorgeous to look at and occasionally touching, but for people who are new to this series, the identity of the characters and their relationships can be occasionally confusing.
Rated: 3/4

While unlikely to win over new viewers, this cinematic farewell succeeds in doing exactly what it sets out to do: provide long-time fans with emotional closure, familiar comforts, and a glorious final bow for a sprawling cast of characters.

Bay Area Reporter
It seems appropriate that this movie might indeed be the fond heartwarming sendoff it purports to be, content with not overstaying its welcome, to the sad sobbing resignation of its legions of devotees.

This was a joy to watch. All the story lines were completed and the characters were lovingly seen to the next chapter of their lives. Truly heartwarming and indeed a grand finale to years of following life at Downton Abbey. If you hadn't watched the years prior you wouldn't enjoy this finale as much.

It was fun to see all the cast from before all grown up.
But the story was the real hit. If youre 70 or over, or retired like I am, you can relate well with the struggles of the older characters who had to pass things on to a younger generation. Then add the culture changes and its hard to change, but change they (and we) must.

My girlfriend fell asleep during the movie!
It was too drawn out. Hurried themes and then at the end it went on and on about them leaving.
Pretty disappointed.
