Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
With its mix of old characters and new, worldly upheaval and small-town drama, Fellowes illustrates what “Downton” has always done best, which is a social examination of how much things have changed and how they haven’t changed at all.

I smiled, I laughed, and I maybe even wiped away a couple of tears, and that’s exactly as it should be.

With a profound embrace of the changing times and clever winks at Downton devotees, writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis deliver a heart-swelling conclusion.

Loyal audiences would watch this ensemble perform the phone book, and Fellowes gives them a good bit more to work with than The Yellow Pages.

Watching this lovely company of actors take their final bows as these beloved characters is a treat, whether the film is perfect or not. This is cinema as comfort food, a cozy blanket for trying times.

It was an apt send off for all the characters we grew to know and love. A little too long (and we hated the half hour of ads and previews ahead of time). But the movie was just what we wanted.

I loved getting to see those who became good friends during the years Downton Abbey was on TV. I never used to miss one of the Sunday night programs.
The Finale was like a reunion for me.

Better than I expected. I've not watched the TV show or other Downton movies, so wasn't sure what to expect but went to make my wife happy and it wasn't bad. :)

Absolutely BRILLIANT!!
I have never had every emotion pulled out of me in a few hours like this movie accomplished.
Script, acting, direction, cinematography, set, everything combined to deliver a faaaaaaaanTAStic experience especially for those who watched the entire series from the very beginning prior to seeing this finale movie.
