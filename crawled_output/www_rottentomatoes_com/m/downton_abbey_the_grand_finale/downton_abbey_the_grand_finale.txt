The main appeal here is the chance to spend time in the company of superb actors who all wear their characters as comfortably as an old silk robe.

"The Grand Finale" goes out not with a bang, but also not with a whimper, but rather a polite wave goodbye.
Rated: B-

Globe and Mail
Returning director Simon Curtis still doesn’t solve the television pacing and plotting problem of making a two-hour fan film that doesn’t feel like episodes tacked together, but at least gives each of the extensive beloved cast an arc and some closure.

Films with explosions and a lot of machinations pale in comparison to seemingly sedate storylines that will be exciting to those in the know.

Should I See It
As a casual fan of Downton Abbey, and someone who has seen all three films and worked my way through the series a few years back, I found plenty to enjoy.
Rated: 3.5/5

...this is a comfort-food platter for longtime devotees, like whatever the adult equivalent is of Chickie Nuggies and Choccy Milk served on a silver platter with Grey Poupon and a bouillon spoon.

Walt
For fans of Downton Abbey, this is a must see.
Very much a return to all the incredible subtlety and fun English norms of the original series.
This was by far our favorite of the 3 movies made from the series, since it really felt like a return to what we loved about it.
The cast never missed a beat, and seemed to click just like when they were doing the show.
Amazing!
My only caution for someone reading this review would be that if you are not familiar with the show and the characters, I think it would be nearly impossible to understand the movie and it's endless subtle nods.
But this was a wonderful night out, to a movie that impossibly raised the bar on the original material!
