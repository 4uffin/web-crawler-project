With a profound embrace of the changing times and clever winks at Downton devotees, writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis deliver a heart-swelling conclusion.

TIME Magazine
Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale transports you to a time and place that seems so much more glamorous than our own, and to see it all splashed out on the big screen is almost overwhelming. It’s a genteel fantasy worth leaving the couch for.

The main appeal here is the chance to spend time in the company of superb actors who all wear their characters as comfortably as an old silk robe.
Rated: 3/4

Metro Times (Detroit, MI)
Watching this lovely company of actors take their final bows as these beloved characters is a treat, whether the film is perfect or not. This is cinema as comfort food, a cozy blanket for trying times.
Rated: B

Less Hat, Moorhead
This Grand Finale doesn't feel particularly grand; as with the two earlier films, it's a relaxing, undemanding holiday, not only from our time and circumstances, but from any judgements we might have about what we're seeing.

Mel Campbell
ABC Radio (Australia)
The overarching theme here is not being able to let go of the past – and it applies just as much to the show's own soothing nostalgia as it does to the former staff who can't stop popping back into the kitchen for a cup of tea, or to polish the silver.

I have watched all of the TV episodes and all of the movies so this was bittersweet to see the ending. It was a great movie done well and they tied it all up with a happy ending. I dont personally like a couple of the storylines but I love the main characters and it was great to see all of them one more time!

The movie was great. The sound in the theater was horrible. I had to ask to have it turned up. For what we pay for a movie it should be stellar.
