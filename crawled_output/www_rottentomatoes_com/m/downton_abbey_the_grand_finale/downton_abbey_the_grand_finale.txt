Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale transports you to a time and place that seems so much more glamorous than our own, and to see it all splashed out on the big screen is almost overwhelming. It’s a genteel fantasy worth leaving the couch for.

The main appeal here is the chance to spend time in the company of superb actors who all wear their characters as comfortably as an old silk robe.

"The Grand Finale" goes out not with a bang, but also not with a whimper, but rather a polite wave goodbye.

Boasts more than a couple of moments that should prove to be priceless for longtime fans and, more importantly, a final few emotions-stirring minutes.
Rated: 3/4

A stunning conclusion for all of our beloved characters in the Crawley family and the Downton estate. Downton Abbey will go down as one of the most influential television shows and film trologies of our time.
Rated: 4.5/5

The film is gorgeous to look at and occasionally touching, but for people who are new to this series, the identity of the characters and their relationships can be occasionally confusing.

Im not much of an entertainment critic, but I throughly enjoyed this final installment of the Downton Abby saga! The acting is superb and the story authentic to the cannon. The homage at
the end was very fitting and help to add closure to the entire series. The writers and actors can take a well deserved bowand maybe pickup the series anew with Lady Mary leading the next generation.

Loved seeing so many familiar faces. Michelle Dockery was incredible. Loved the storyline highlighting the social isolation of divorced women.
Creative storyline introducing Noel Coward to society to re-establish Mary's position.
Able to empathize with the Earl of Grantham as he gives up control and leaves the house he loves. Pleased that they focused on the legacy issue and did not blame the transfer of control to cognitive issues.

After experiencing years of ups and downs of the Grantham family, as well as the servants,
this was a perfect ending!
It gave credit to the past and actions of the older generation, while placing hopes on the younger generation to bring change and growth.
Perfect!
