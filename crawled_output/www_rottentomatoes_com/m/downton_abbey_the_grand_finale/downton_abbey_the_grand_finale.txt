Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale transports you to a time and place that seems so much more glamorous than our own, and to see it all splashed out on the big screen is almost overwhelming. It’s a genteel fantasy worth leaving the couch for.

The main appeal here is the chance to spend time in the company of superb actors who all wear their characters as comfortably as an old silk robe.

"The Grand Finale" goes out not with a bang, but also not with a whimper, but rather a polite wave goodbye.
Rated: B-

Boasts more than a couple of moments that should prove to be priceless for longtime fans and, more importantly, a final few emotions-stirring minutes.
Rated: 3/4

A stunning conclusion for all of our beloved characters in the Crawley family and the Downton estate. Downton Abbey will go down as one of the most influential television shows and film trologies of our time.
Rated: 4.5/5

The Michael Medved Show
The film is gorgeous to look at and occasionally touching, but for people who are new to this series, the identity of the characters and their relationships can be occasionally confusing.

I liked the transition to modern life and the passage to the younger generation. I was most amused at one of the later comments that they would have to cook their own meals!

Downtown Abbey The Grand Finale was one of the best movies Ive seen.
It was very well done.
It started out GRAND and did not disappoint at all.
We loved it, and hope there will be another Downton Abbey series start with Lady Mary being at the helm of Downton Abby!!

Brought me to tears.
Lady Mary at her best, Lady Edith at strength, and Lord Grantham his usual stubborn and uncertainty.
A wonderful tribute to Dame Maggie Smith and the entire franchise.
