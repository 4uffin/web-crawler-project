Set in the mid-90s, Steve is a reimagining of Max Porter's Sunday Times bestseller Shy. The film follows a pivotal day in the life of headteacher Steve and his students at a last-chance reform school amidst a world that has forsaken them. As Steve fights to protect the school's integrity and impending closure, we witness him grappling with his own mental health. In parallel to Steve's struggles, we meet Shy, a troubled teen caught between his past and what lies ahead as he tries to reconcile his inner fragility with his impulse for self-destruction and violence.

The resulting film is an emotional roller coaster and a call to action, demanding its audience rethink their views of such schools and those within them.

The Hollywood Reporter
[Cillian Murphy] gives a riveting performance, with searing pain fighting against the self-control and measured disposition he requires to do the job.

So much of ’Steve' feels designed to get a response from the viewer on the other side of the glass when a better movie would give us the feeling we’re actually in the same room.
Rated: 2.5/4

Le Noir Auteur
It’s a harrowing watch (it does get smidge too silly at times) but its worth it just be engaged in all the drama.

Collider
While Steve might be familiar to anyone who has seen similar films about troubled kids in a school unprepared to give them the help they deserve, it does once more show Mielants’ gift for extracting yet another strong performance from Cillian Murphy.
Rated: 6/10

Movies For The Rest Of Us
So intimate is the filming style, and so lifelike are the performances, you’ll keep forgetting this is, as they say, only a movie. Director Tim Mielants has assembled a young cast who seem to forget there’s a camera running.
Rated: 3/5
