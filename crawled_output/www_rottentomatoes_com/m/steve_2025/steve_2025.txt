Set in the mid-90s, Steve is a reimagining of Max Porter's Sunday Times bestseller Shy. The film follows a pivotal day in the life of headteacher Steve and his students at a last-chance reform school amidst a world that has forsaken them. As Steve fights to protect the school's integrity and impending closure, we witness him grappling with his own mental health. In parallel to Steve's struggles, we meet Shy, a troubled teen caught between his past and what lies ahead as he tries to reconcile his inner fragility with his impulse for self-destruction and violence.

David Jenkins
Little White Lies
Porter tries to sell us the notion that these types of institutions have some sort of implicit or therapeutic value, but is never serious in talking about the genuine pressures and obstacles that make their maintenance so difficult.
Rated: 2/5

Ty Burr
Washington Post
The film ends with a plea for viewers suffering from depression and other mental health issues to reach out for help. “Steve” is a deeply compassionate drama of why they should.
Rated: 3/4

Miriam Balanescu
Empire Magazine
Making full use of Cillian Murphy’s emotional range, Steve is a rallying, railing portrayal of a broken education system — and contemporary cinema’s worthy answer to Dead Poets Society.
Rated: 4/5

Shadows on the Wall
This is an ambitiously inventive film that takes very big swings as it propels the audience into the mindset of both teachers and students who are feeling the pressure. Thankfully, there's some strong humour accompanying the big emotions.
Rated: 4/5

Tori Brazier
Metro
It will take viewers back to their own school days in the most evocative and eye-opening of ways... Steve quietly grabs you at the throat and doesn’t let go for a stressful, sometimes funny, and often poignant 92 minutes, thanks to its outstanding cast.
Rated: 4/5
