The Conjuring: Last Rites
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Purportedly Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson's final outing as the Warrens, Last Rites underwhelms as a climactic chapter for The Conjuring but solidly upholds the franchise's spooky standards.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The performances still possess in The Conjuring, and while Last Rites maintains its signature eerie atmosphere, this conclusion falls short of the scare power of earlier installments.

Bill Goodykoontz
Arizona Republic
Thanks to Wilson and Farmiga, who know the exact register of intensity to play these characters, it’s easy to remain invested in Ed and Lorraine, their work and their love slightly out of time.
Rated: 3/5

Maxwell Rabb
Chicago Reader
It might not conjure something phenomenal, but, for longtime fans, it’s a mostly fitting curtain call for a franchise that always believed in its own ghosts.

Ed Potton
The Times (UK)
Such subtlety has largely vanished by the final reel, sadly, but this is still a suitably shiver-inducing farewell to the Warrens.
Rated: 4/5

The Cosmic Circus
This “life’s like a chapter; there’s nothing wrong when one ends and another begins” aspect of The Conjuring: Last Rites is where the movie actively works in its favor, even if it contains none of the hallmarks that paying audiences want to see.
Rated: 3/5

Dexerto
The Conjuring series concludes with a solid entry that isn’t as exciting or scary as previous efforts, but delivers effective drama, and a touching finale.

Was solid but disappointing compared to the rest of the movies in the series. Felt unbalanced with the horror, feels like you go through so much action and scary stuff, then they try to scare you with something that wouldn’t even remotely scare you sfter what you had just saw
