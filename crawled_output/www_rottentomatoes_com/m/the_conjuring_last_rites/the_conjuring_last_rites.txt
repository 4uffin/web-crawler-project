The Conjuring: Last Rites
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Purportedly Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson's final outing as the Warrens, Last Rites underwhelms as a climactic chapter for The Conjuring but solidly upholds the franchise's spooky standards.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The performances still possess in The Conjuring, and while Last Rites maintains its signature eerie atmosphere, this conclusion falls short of the scare power of earlier installments.

Maxwell Rabb
Chicago Reader
It might not conjure something phenomenal, but, for longtime fans, it’s a mostly fitting curtain call for a franchise that always believed in its own ghosts.

The Times (UK)
Such subtlety has largely vanished by the final reel, sadly, but this is still a suitably shiver-inducing farewell to the Warrens.
Rated: 4/5

IndieWire
“Last Rites” has a sense of humor and that’s worth watching if you’re up for a laugh instead of a scream.
Rated: C+

FandomWire
While it's got good scares, the story in The Conjuring: Last Rites falls unbelievably short. The result is an uneven, and sometimes boring movie.
Rated: 5/10

Carla Hay
Culture Mix
The Conjuring: Last Rites is a jumbled horror movie that has too many plot holes and too many over-used clichés. This bland story (about a haunted mirror and demon possession) is a mix of dull family scenes and unimaginative terror scenes.

El estímulo
'The Conjuring: Last Rites' blends nostalgia, strong acting, and intense moments, though it falls short with its villain and a pace that doesn't live up to the legacy. [Full Review in Spanish]

Was looking forward to more scale and more scares from this one, but underdelivered on both. There are worthwhile scares, but this felt like a middle-of-the-franchise film, not the magnum opus I was expecting.

I think the movie was overall probably good but I had the single worse movie going experience seeing this film. Nothing against the film but everyone was talking and taking phone calls and being overall disrespectful.
