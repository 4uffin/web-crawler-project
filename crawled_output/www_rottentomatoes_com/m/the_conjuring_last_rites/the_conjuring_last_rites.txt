The Conjuring: Last Rites
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Purportedly Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson's final outing as the Warrens, Last Rites underwhelms as a climactic chapter for The Conjuring but solidly upholds the franchise's spooky standards.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The performances still possess in The Conjuring, and while Last Rites maintains its signature eerie atmosphere, this conclusion falls short of the scare power of earlier installments.

Chicago Reader
It might not conjure something phenomenal, but, for longtime fans, it’s a mostly fitting curtain call for a franchise that always believed in its own ghosts.

The Times (UK)
Such subtlety has largely vanished by the final reel, sadly, but this is still a suitably shiver-inducing farewell to the Warrens.
Rated: 4/5

“Last Rites” has a sense of humor and that’s worth watching if you’re up for a laugh instead of a scream.
Rated: C+

Bloody Good Horror (Podcast)
The Conjuring: Last Rites is not aggressively bad; it's just aggressively middle of the road.

Trace Thurman
Horror Queers Podcast
While it flubs in the horror department, offering rehashes of the same old scares from previous films, 'Last Rites' nails the emotional component, serving as a touching send-off for this fictionalized version of the Warrens.
Rated: 3/5

While the heights of the first two Conjuring films are never reached by Last Rites this is still a solid, entertaining bounce back from the disappointing third installment. This film gives a satisfying ending to the Conjuring Universe

The movie was engaging and well-crafted. While it wasn’t particularly scary, it maintained a suspenseful atmosphere throughout. As the final installment in the series, it wrapped up the storyline effectively, providing satisfying conclusions to the characters’ arcs and tying up loose ends in a compelling way.
