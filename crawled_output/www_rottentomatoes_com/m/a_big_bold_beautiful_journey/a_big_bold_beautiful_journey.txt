Some doors bring you to your past. Some doors lead you to your future. And some doors change everything. Sarah (Margot Robbie) and David (Colin Farrell) are single strangers who meet at a mutual friend's wedding and soon, through a surprising twist of fate, find themselves on A Big Bold Beautiful Journey -- a funny, fantastical, sweeping adventure together where they get to re-live important moments from their respective pasts, illuminating how they got to where they are in the present... and possibly getting a chance to alter their futures.

Brandon Yu
New York Times
You would think that for a movie with such a title there’d be a bit more big lights and conventional grandiosity, but there’s a formal limpness to the way it tugs at one’s heartstrings.

Ty Burr
Washington Post
Like many long-shot rolls of the dice, it’s a movie that sometimes cuts to the core of human feeling and sometimes has an audience cringing at its achingly whimsical pretensions.
Rated: 2/4

New York Magazine/Vulture
Farrell and Robbie are adrift, but then Kline and Waller-Bridge (doing a broad German accent) never figure out the right tone for the touch of the surreal they represent.

For those willing to give themselves over to a slightly bizarre romance, A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is a film that hits all the right marks.

I mean this in the best possible way, but A Big Bold Beautiful Journey has what people like to call “big theatre kid energy.”
Rated: 7/10

Denerstein Unleashed
Theatrical but lifeless, Beautiful Journey plays like a series of scenes lifted from an acting class. Put another way, the movie feels self-conscious and contrived. Too often, Kogonada's fantasy flatlines.
