David Fear
Rolling Stone
Excuse the cynicism, but this is the sort of combination of touchy-feely button-pushing and self-conscious peculiarity that’s meant to seem significant and profound that will bring out your inner rom-com Grinch.

Richard Brody
The New Yorker
The refinement of Kogonada’s direction is never in question, but, paradoxically, it may make things worse. A less deft or more vulgar filmmaker might have endowed the formulaic emotions with an element of camp.

The film is most enjoyable as a testament to the charisma and skills of Robbie and Farrell.
Rated: 2.5/4

The Pitch
As much as the movie is really a pile of sentiment wrapped up in some nice cinematography, there are themes about pursuing happiness over contentment, grief and disappointment that do contain some striking universal truths.

Even though their chemistry is not always entirely convincing, audiences are sure to be rooting for this romance because Margot and Colin are so good.
Rated: 3/5

Margot Robbie & Colin Farrell are Awesome in this movie.
Whomever wrote the Screenplay should be praised
for making people think about Choices, mistakes, phobias, pre-concieved notions in their head, expectations met (or not) affecting the paths theyve chosen to take be it good or bad.

Won’t own it, probably won’t watch it again, but enjoyed it! The language was unnecessary and added nothing, but was a good illustration of settling your past & moving forward!
