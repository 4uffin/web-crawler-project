Some doors bring you to your past. Some doors lead you to your future. And some doors change everything. Sarah (Margot Robbie) and David (Colin Farrell) are single strangers who meet at a mutual friend's wedding and soon, through a surprising twist of fate, find themselves on A Big Bold Beautiful Journey -- a funny, fantastical, sweeping adventure together where they get to re-live important moments from their respective pasts, illuminating how they got to where they are in the present... and possibly getting a chance to alter their futures.

Alonso Duralde
The Film Verdict
Unpacks a great deal of style to say very little, but style quickly turns grating when there’s no substance to back it up. Beautiful it may be, but Bold? Hardly.

Nell Minow
Movie Mom
The story’s encouragement for those who have the courage to take a risk and change old patterns has a quiet optimism that may send some of us to open a few bold and beautiful doors ourselves.
Rated: B+

I admire you for trying to make it work, 'A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,' but I think we should both see other films.

Reeling Reviews
This 'big, bold, beautiful' journey took a serious wrong turn.
Rated: C-

Conor O'Donnell
The Film Stage
As a sweeping, romantic fantasy, A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is less grounded than the quiet modernist backdrops of Columbus or the pragmatic futurism of After Yang, but its blueprint is not wholly dissimilar.

The News-Herald (Willoughby, OH)
A Big Bold Beautiful Journey all but insists you to think back to paths not taken — or, to use its metaphorical framing, doors not opened.
Rated: 3.5/4
