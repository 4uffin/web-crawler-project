I think this is the bill https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-f...It still annoys me to no end that MSM refuses to link to the original source.Here's the quote> Authorizes the State Department to revoke passports to any individual who been charged, convicted, or determined to have knowingly aided, assisted, abetted, or otherwise provided material support to a foreign terrorist organization.replybrazukadev 22 minutes ago

Isn't this directly violating the Constitution?replyTheFreim 7 hours ago

I can see particular applications of the law being unconstitutional, i.e. improper rationale for designating a group as being a foreign terrorist organization, but generally speaking I don't expect there would be any constitutional issue with preventing people charged with materially supporting terrorism from being able to flee the country using a passport.Is there any section of the constitution that you think would be violated by the letter of the law?replysniffers 7 hours ago

I'm not sure the constitution matters that much to the party in charge at the moment.replycoderatlarge 7 hours ago

if nothing else, one has to give the ruling coalition credit for debugging the vaunted constitutional system.
maybe the winning argument for the opposition will be to amend away all the vulnerabilities that were just exploited.replyburnt-resistor 3 minutes ago

The US political system isn't code, it's rich vs. poor. It only pretended to be democratic and moral for 250 years, but now it's a tin pot dictatorship because of slowly increased corruption due to uncorrected weakness even Kurt Gödel identified that were never addressed because the rich/powerful benefited from them.It's also wishful thinking to suppose a corrupt, weak Congress would ever do anything to limit their own corruption. John McCain discovered there was zero appetite for reform.replywryoak 31 minutes ago

The SCOTUS majority has largely put their hands in their pockets and granted Trump more equal than others status so I'm not sure it would matter.reply
