I think this is the bill https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/news/press-releases/house-f...It still annoys me to no end that MSM refuses to link to the original source.Here's the quote> Authorizes the State Department to revoke passports to any individual who been charged, convicted, or determined to have knowingly aided, assisted, abetted, or otherwise provided material support to a foreign terrorist organization.triage8004 6 hours ago

Isn't this directly violating the Constitution?TheFreim 6 hours ago

I can see particular applications of the law being unconstitutional, i.e. improper rationale for designating a group as being a foreign terrorist organization, but generally speaking I don't expect there would be any constitutional issue with preventing people charged with materially supporting terrorism from being able to flee the country using a passport.Is there any section of the constitution that you think would be violated by the letter of the law?sniffers 6 hours ago

if nothing else, one has to give the ruling coalition credit for debugging the vaunted constitutional system.
maybe the winning argument for the opposition will be to amend away all the vulnerabilities that were just exploited.duxup 6 hours ago

The SCOTUS majority has largely put their hands in their pockets and granted Trump more equal than others status so I'm not sure it would matter.
