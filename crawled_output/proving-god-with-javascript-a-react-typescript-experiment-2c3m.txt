Exploring God Proofs Through Code - A React & TypeScript Experiment
#webdev
#javascript
#typescript
#discuss
Have you ever wondered if it's possible to simulate philosophical arguments using code? That's exactly what inspired me to build GodSim — an interactive simulator of classical and modern arguments for the existence of God, all implemented with React and TypeScript. Each argument is accompanied by a code simulation, showing the logic behind the proof. Each proof simulates a philosophical argument programmatically. The simulator demonstrates logical reasoning, not empirical proof.
I wanted to create a fun, hands-on way to explore deep philosophical concepts while practicing modern web development techniques. GodSim lets you experiment with 11 different proofs, see their results in real-time, and even inspect the underlying JavaScript logic behind each argument.
Whether you're a developer curious about philosophy, or someone interested in computational simulations, GodSim combines reasoning, probability, and interactivity in one project.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React, TypeScript, MUI, Vite
Code Highlighting: react-syntax-highlighter
CI/CD: GitHub Actions (build + deploy to GitHub Pages)
Features
Simulates 11 different proofs of God's existence:
Ontological Argument
Cosmological Argument
Fine-Tuning Argument
Moral Argument
Design Argument
Beauty / Aesthetics Argument
Reason / Logic Argument
Contingency Argument
Sustainer Argument
Infinite Regress Argument
First Cause Argument
Interactive simulations with adjustable parameters.
Code snippets displayed with syntax highlighting using react-syntax-highlighter.
Built with modern stack: Vite + React + TypeScript + MUI.
Deploys automatically to GitHub Pages via CI/CD.
Live Demo

How It Works
Each proof simulates a philosophical argument programmatically. For example:
1. Ontological Argument
Argument: God, defined as the greatest conceivable being, must exist in reality because existence is a necessary attribute of greatness
Simulation: A Being class is used to compare conceptual and actual existence
class Being {
constructor(existsInReality = false) {
this.existsInReality = existsInReality
}
}
function simulateOntological() {
const god = new Being(false)
const maximalBeing = new Being(true)
if (maximalBeing.existsInReality && !god.existsInReality) god.existsInReality = true
return god.existsInReality
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Cosmological Argument
Argument: Everything that exists has a cause. To avoid infinite regress, there must be a first uncaused cause, which is God.
Simulation: A chain of causes is created
class Cause {
constructor(causedBy = null) {
this.causedBy = causedBy
}
}
function findFirstCause(entity) {
while (entity.causedBy !== null) entity = entity.causedBy
return entity
}
function simulateCosmological(depth = 3) {
if (depth < 1) depth = 1
let universe = new Cause(null)
for (let i = 1; i < depth; i++) {
universe = new Cause(universe)
}
const firstCause = findFirstCause(universe)
return firstCause !== null
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
3. Fine-Tuning Argument
Argument: The physical constants of the universe are extremely unlikely to allow life by chance alone, suggesting a designer
Simulation: Randomly simulate universes to see if one “supports life”
function universeExists(probability = 1e-4) {
return Math.random() < probability
}
function simulateFineTuning(count = 100000) {
const results = Array.from({ length: count }, () => universeExists())
return results.includes(true)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
4. Moral Argument
Argument: Objective moral values exist and require a moral lawgiver, identified as God.
Simulation: A simple Being class models knowledge of good and evil
function simulateMoral() {
class Being {
knowsGood = true
knowsEvil = true
}
const creature = new Being()
return creature.knowsGood && creature.knowsEvil
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
5. Design Argument
Argument: Observing order, complexity, and purpose in nature suggests the existence of an intelligent designer.
Simulation: Random patterns are generated to represent natural design
function simulateDesign() {
const patterns = Array.from({ length: 10 }, () => Math.random())
const sum = patterns.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
return sum > 0
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
6. Beauty / Aesthetics Argument
Argument: The existence of beauty and order in the universe points toward a transcendent source.
Simulation: Random patterns are scored for beauty
function simulateBeauty() {
const patterns = Array.from({ length: 5 }, () => Math.random())
const beautyScore = patterns.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
return beautyScore > 0
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
7. Reason / Logic Argument
Argument: Humans can reason and the universe is logically intelligible, suggesting a rational foundation (God).
Simulation: Reasoning is assumed always possible
function simulateReason() {
return true
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
8. Contingency Argument
Argument: Everything contingent depends on a necessary being for its existence.
Simulation: Check all contingent things exist
function simulateContingency() {
const contingentThings = Array(10).fill(true)
return contingentThings.every(Boolean)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
9. Sustainer Argument
Argument: Contingent things exist because they are sustained. God is the necessary, self-sustaining being.
Simulation: Model contingent things and God sustaining them
function simulateSustainer() {
const contingentThings = ['Earth', 'Sun', 'Stars', 'Creatures']
const allSustained = contingentThings.every(() => true)
const godExists = true
const godSelfSustaining = true
return allSustained && godExists && godSelfSustaining
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
10. Infinite Regress Argument
Argument: Infinite regress of causes is impossible; a first uncaused cause must exist.
Simulation: Build a chain of entities, return false to indicate impossibility
function simulateInfiniteRegress(chainDepth = 1000) {
class Entity {
causedBy = null
constructor(causedBy = null) {
this.causedBy = causedBy
}
}
let current = null
for (let i = 0; i < chainDepth; i++) {
current = new Entity(current)
}
return false
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
11. First Cause Argument
Argument: Every effect has causes. Infinite regress is impossible, so a first uncaused cause exists (God).
Simulation: Build a tree of causes, check for cycles
function simulateFirstCause(chainDepth = 10, branches = 3) {
class Entity {
causedBy = []
constructor(parents = []) {
this.causedBy = parents
}
}
function buildTree(depth, branchFactor, parentEntities = []) {
if (depth <= 0) return []
const entities = []
for (let i = 0; i < branchFactor; i++) {
const newEntity = new Entity(parentEntities)
entities.push(newEntity)
entities.push(...buildTree(depth - 1, branchFactor, [newEntity]))
}
return entities
}
const universe = buildTree(chainDepth, branches)
const visited = new Set()
function hasCycle(entity) {
if (visited.has(entity)) return true
visited.add(entity)
for (const parent of entity.causedBy) {
if (hasCycle(parent)) return true
}
visited.delete(entity)
return false
}
const infiniteRegress = universe.some(e => hasCycle(e))
const firstCauseExists = !infiniteRegress && universe.length > 0
return firstCauseExists
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Feel free to try out GodSim and experiment with the simulations yourself!
That's it! I hope you enjoyed reading.
