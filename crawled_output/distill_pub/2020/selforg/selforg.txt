Self-organisation is omnipresent on all scales of biological life. From complex interactions between molecules
forming structures such as proteins, to cell colonies achieving global goals like exploration by means of the
individual cells collaborating and communicating, to humans forming collectives in society such as tribes,
governments or countries. The old adage “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”, often ascribed to
Aristotle, rings true everywhere we look.
The articles in this thread focus on practical ways of designing self-organizing systems. In particular we use
Differentiable Programming (optimization) to learn agent-level policies that satisfy system-level objectives. The
cross-disciplinary nature of this thread aims to facilitate ideas exchange between ML and developmental biology
communities.
Articles & Comments
Distill has invited several researchers to publish a “thread” of short articles exploring differentiable
self-organizing systems,
interspersed with critical commentary from several experts in adjacent fields.
The thread will be a living document, with new articles added over time.
Articles and comments are presented below in chronological order:

Building their own bodies is the very first skill all living creatures possess. How can we design systems that
grow, maintain and repair themselves by regenerating damages? This work investigates morphogenesis, the
process by which living creatures self-assemble their bodies. It proposes a differentiable, Cellular Automata
model of morphogenesis and shows how such a model learns a robust and persistent set of dynamics to grow any
arbitrary structure starting from a single cell.

This work presents a follow up to Growing Neural CAs, using a similar computational model for the goal of
digit “self-classification”. The authors show how neural CAs can self-classify the MNIST digit they form. The
resulting CAs can be interacted with by dynamically changing the underlying digit. The CAs respond to
perturbations with a learned self-correcting classification behaviour.

Here the authors apply Neural Cellular Automata to a new domain: texture synthesis. They begin by training NCA
to mimic a series of textures taken from template images. Then, taking inspiration from adversarial
camouflages which appear in nature, they use NCA to create textures which maximally excite neurons in a
pretrained vision model. These results reveal that a simple model combined with well-known objectives can lead
to robust and unexpected behaviors.

This work takes existing Neural CA models and shows how they can be adversarially reprogrammed to perform novel tasks.
MNIST CA can be deceived into outputting incorrect classifications and the patterns in Growing CA can be made to have their shape and colour altered.

Get Involved
The Self-Organizing systems thread is open to articles exploring differentiable self-organizing sytems.
Critical
commentary and discussion of existing articles is also welcome. The thread
is organized through the open #selforg channel on the
Distill slack. Articles can be
suggested there, and will be included at the discretion of previous
authors in the thread, or in the case of disagreement by an uninvolved
editor.
If you would like get involved but don’t know where to start, small
projects may be available if you ask in the channel.
About the Thread Format
Part of Distill’s mandate is to experiment with new forms of scientific
publishing. We believe that that reconciling faster and more continuous
approaches to publication with review and discussion is an important open
problem in scientific publishing.
Threads are collections of short articles, experiments, and critical
commentary around a narrow or unusual research topic, along with a slack
channel for real time discussion and collaboration. They are intended to
be earlier stage than a full Distill paper, and allow for more fluid
publishing, feedback and discussion. We also hope they’ll allow for wider
participation. Think of a cross between a Twitter thread, an academic
workshop, and a book of collected essays.
Threads are very much an experiment. We think it’s possible they’re a
great format, and also possible they’re terrible. We plan to trial two
such threads and then re-evaluate our thought on the format.
Editorial Note
Part of Distill’s mandate is to experiment with new forms of scientific publishing.
We believe something along the lines of this “thread” format might be promising,
but see it very much as an experiment.
We plan to trial two such threads and then re-evaluate our thought on the format.
