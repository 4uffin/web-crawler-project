Company that owns Gucci, Balenciaga, other brands confirms hack
Kering confirmed a data breach affecting customers of its luxury brands Gucci, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, Yves Saint Lauren, and others, on Monday.
Hackers stole sensitive customer data such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and the total amount of money they spent in stores all over the world. The BBC first reported the breach.
Kering said the hackers did not steal credit card numbers and that it has contacted the customers whose data is part of the breach, without saying how many were affected.
The BBC said the hackers behind the hack are an infamous group called ShinyHunters, who claimed to have stolen data linked to 7.4 million email addresses.
