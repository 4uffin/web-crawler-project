HBO Max is going to get more expensive, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO says
Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has stated that HBO Max will become more expensive, while also making it harder to share passwords, as first reported by The Hollywood Reporter. Zaslav spoke about the future of the streaming service at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference.
“The fact that this is quality — and that’s true across our company, motion picture, TV production, and streaming quality — we all think that gives us a chance to raise price,” he said. “We think we’re way underpriced.”
Zaslav also said that the streaming service’s crackdown on passwords will be coming in the future.
“We haven’t been pushing on the password sharing and the economics yet,” he said. “People are really starting to love HBO Max. That’s the key. We want them to fall in love with our content, with our series, with the differentiated offering outside of the U.S. It’s all tricky with the password sharing. We’re going to begin to push on that.”
Currently, a Basic with Ads plan costs $9.99 per month, a Standard plan costs $16.99 per month, and a Premium plan costs $20.99 per month.
