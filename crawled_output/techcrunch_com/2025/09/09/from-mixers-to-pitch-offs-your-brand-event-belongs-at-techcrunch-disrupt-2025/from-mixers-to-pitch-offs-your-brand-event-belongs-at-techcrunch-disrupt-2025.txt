From mixers to pitch-offs — your brand event belongs at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
3:40 PM PDT · September 9, 2025
Last year’s TechCrunch Disrupt Side Events drew hundreds of founders, investors, and operators after hours — from intimate roundtables to lively happy hours to full-on pitch competitions. Each event unlocked new opportunities for the hosts: investor deal flow, talent connections, and brand exposure with the startup community.
This year, you can do the same. As a Side Event host during “Disrupt Week” (October 25–31), you’ll tap into an audience of 10,000+ attendees, plus the broader Bay Area tech community.
Why host a Side Event?
Visibility: Your brand featured in Disrupt 2025 Side Event listings on the event site, event app, and TechCrunch.com.
Connections: Meet startup leaders and investors in your own environment.
Flexibility: From panels to parties, it’s your format, your brand.
Applications are free — and spots are limited. Submit your Side Event before applications close this Friday, September 12.
