Vibe coding? Meet vibe security

Sep 10, 2025
As AI evolves at breakneck speed, attackers are evolving right alongside it. Vibe coding, AI agents, and prompt-based attacks are opening enterprises up to new vulnerabilities daily. The pressure is on for cybersecurity tools to keep pace, and startups are seizing the moment. Few have grown as rapidly as Wiz, which Google is acquiring for $32 billion in its largest-ever purchase.
On today’s episode of Equity, Wiz co-founder and chief technologist Ami Luttwak joined Rebecca Bellan to discuss how AI is fundamentally reshaping cybersecurity threats, from supply chain attacks that leverage vibe coding to hackers targeting the AI agents that developers rely on daily. His message is clear: while AI tools help developers build faster, they’re also creating more vulnerable code by default, and attackers are already exploiting these weaknesses at scale.
Listen to the full episode to hear:
Why recent attacks affecting thousands of companies show AI security threats are here now
How vibe coding creates less secure applications and what developers can do about it
Why even a five-person AI startup needs a CISO from day one to win enterprise customers
How AI startups can access customer data without compromising security
Where Luttwak sees the biggest opportunities for innovation across the cybersecurity landscape
