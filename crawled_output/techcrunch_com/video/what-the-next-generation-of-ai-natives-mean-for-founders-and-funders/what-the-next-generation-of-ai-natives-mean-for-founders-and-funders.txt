What the next generation of AI natives mean for founders and funders

4:43 PM PDT · June 20, 2025
Ali Partovi has helped launch the careers of a generation of elite founders through Neo. Russell Kaplan is building Cognition, the AI-native company behind Devin, the so-called “AI software engineer.”
Together, they unpack what it means to build and back technical talent in the AI age, what young founders often get wrong, and why this moment feels different from past tech waves.
Partovi and Kaplan joined TechCrunch at our StrictlyVC Menlo Park event in June 2025, among several other speakers whose discussions you can find here: https://bit.ly/4kZETuQ
