Get a look at the real-time translation the new AirPods Pro 3 bring to your ears, which you can prompt through a gesture. Powered by Apple Intelligence, it uses noise cancellation to reduce the volume of the speaker to elevate the provided translation to the user. It came as one of several updates to the newly revealed AirPods Pro 3, which made their debut at Apple’s iPhone 17 launch event.
