Why Robinhood’s co-founder is betting on solar power from space
TC Video
4:43 PM PDT · June 19, 2025
As the co-founder of Robinhood, Baiju Bhatt helped redefine how millions of people interact with trading and investing. Now he’s setting his sights even higher — literally — with Aetherflux, a new venture aiming to harness solar power in space.
In this chat, Bhatt talks about what drew him to one of the most audacious bets in tech, how building in hard science compares to fintech, and why big risks still matter.
Bhatt joined TechCrunch at our StrictlyVC Menlo Park event in June 2025, among several other speakers whose discussions you can find here.
