How we do it will change more over the next decade than it has in the last century. Legacy automakers, like Ford and GM, are scrambling to become technology-savvy companies, and the tech industry is trying to cash in on the change. New players, like Rivian and Tesla, are disrupting the industry and sometimes stumbling. We look at how self-driving hardware and software make the automobile better or, in some cases, deeply flawed. We cut through the hype and empty promises to tell you what’s really happening and what we think is coming. Verge Transportation cares about all moving machines and the place they have in the future.RELATED /BikesCloseBikesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All BikesStellantis cancels Ram 1500 REV as electric truck demand dimsThe automaker is keeping the “REV” name and giving it to the range-extended version of the truckAndrew J.
