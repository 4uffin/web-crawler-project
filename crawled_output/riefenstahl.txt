Filmmaker and Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl is considered one of the most controversial women of the 20th century. Her films Triumph of the Will and Olympia are defined by their fascist aesthetics, perfectly-staged body worship, and the celebration of all that is "superior" and victorious, simultaneously projecting contempt for the imperfect and weak. But Riefenstahl -- who first broke into the German film industry as an actress -- spent decades after the war denying her association with Nazi ideology, and claiming ignorance of the Holocaust. How did she become the Reich's preeminent filmmaker if she was just a hired hand? Riefenstahl examines this question using never-before-seen documents from Leni Riefenstahl's estate, including private films, photos, recordings and letters, uncovering fragments of her biography and placing them in an extended historical context. During her long life after the fall of Nazism, she remained unapologetic, managing to control and shape her legacy; in personal documents, she mourns her "murdered ideals." Meanwhile, her work would experience a renaissance, gaining esteem for its masterful technical skill. Today, Riefenstahl's aesthetics are more present than ever. Is that also true for their message? In an era where fascism is on the rise again, fake news is prevalent, and the meaning of political imagery is constantly dissected and debated, Andres Veiel's mesmerizing new film shows that Leni Reifenstahl is more relevant than ever.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Organizing a treasure trove of archival materials with impressive intellectual rigor, director Andres Veiel's documentary methodically dismantles Leni Riefenstahl's self-mythologizing to offer an historically clear-eyed assessment of her legacy.

Where Veiel's film locks itself into a loop of attempting to show just how much of a Nazi Leni Riefenstahl was, it falls short. However what is revealed beyond that is much more disturbing.

Wall Street Journal
Mr. Veiel has performed a remarkable feat of archival spelunking, piecing together a documentary portrait that is measured in tone and damning in effect.

New York Times
In his coolly damning documentary “Riefenstahl,” the German filmmaker Andres Veiel joins a persistent cohort of skeptics and detractors who have long challenged Riefenstahl’s self-serving identity as an innocent artist.

It’s difficult to say what Andres Veiel’s film really serves to prove beyond making a case against Leni Riefenstahl that has been presented by seemingly everyone for decades.

The art reveals the artist, and Leni Riefenstahl’s art reveals that her attraction to fascist ideals was a lifelong one. While there is certainly stunning imagery in her films, perhaps now we can finally leave her where she belongs, in history’s dust bin.
