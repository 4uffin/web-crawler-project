Dubbed "the greatest that never was," Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was FORMULA 1's most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, he's a nomadic racer-for-hire when he's approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling FORMULA 1 team that is on the verge of collapse. Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to FORMULA 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world. He'll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace. But as the engines roar, Sonny's past catches up with him and he finds that in FORMULA 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition--and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone.

F1 The Movie
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Driven by Brad Pitt's laidback magnetism and sporting a souped-up engine courtesy of Joseph Kosinski's kinetic direction, F1 The Movie brings vintage cool across the finish line.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Fueled by Brad Pitt’s effortless charisma, F1 The Movie, is a velociously loud and exceedingly exciting motion picture that deserves to be experienced on the biggest screen possible.

Kosinski has done things so well that he's managed to break down my—until now—impregnable defenses. [Full review in Spanish]

F1: The Movie has the formula for success. It’s got the fuel.
Cruise must be smiling as Pitt takes the checkered flag.
Rated: 3/4

F1: The Movie is not just a movie, it's a film constructed to look like entertainment, with all of the bells and whistles ringing so loudly you'll forget that what you're watching has very little in the way of actual story.

The adrenaline-pumping overtake all weaker elements and demands full investment in whatever the latest crisis is. The cast and crew elevate this again even further.

F1: the movie is a blast, burning rubber from start to finish. A wonderful team of Kosinski, Bruckheimer, Pitt, and Zimmer have teamed to formulate a thunderous experience that is among the years very best films.
Rated: 89/100

It all ends in a visual noise that, while it exploits our emotion, all it does is drag on. [Full review in Spanish]
