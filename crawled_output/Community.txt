Code of conduct
By participating in and contributing to any of our projects in-person or online, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines (CPG).
General support
We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing web ecosystem.
Unfortunately, we can't help with general support questions, such as troubleshooting code.
If you're learning, the Learn web development section is a great start, and you can post coding questions or search for answers on Stack Overflow.
Issues, discussions, or pull requests on MDN repositories asking for general support will be directed here and may be closed and locked.
