Tanjiro Kamado -- a boy who joined an organization dedicated to hunting down demons called the Demon Slayer Corps after his younger sister Nezuko was turned into a demon. While growing stronger and deepening his friendships and bonds with fellow corps members, Tanjiro has battled many demons with his comrades -- Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Along the way, his journey has led him to fight alongside the Demon Slayer Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, the Hashira, including Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku aboard the Mugen Train, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui within the Entertainment District, as well as Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji at the Swordsmith Village. As the Demon Slayer Corps members and Hashira engaged in a group strength training program, the Hashira Training, in preparation for the forthcoming battle against the demons, Muzan Kibutsuji appears at the Ubuyashiki Mansion. With the head of the Demon Corps in danger, Tanjiro and the Hashira rush to the headquarters but are plunged into a deep descent to a mysterious space by the hands of Muzan Kibutsuji. The destination of where Tanjiro and Demon Slayer Corps have fallen is the demons' stronghold -- the Infinity Castle. And so, the battleground is set as the final battle between the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons ignites.

Variety
Beyond the sheer inventiveness of the movie‚Äôs made-up martial arts, that leaves the tragic elements, which can be disarmingly effective in giving audiences reason to feel invested in the battles -- battles that have only just begun.

While the plot is simple, the visual imagery and the emotions are complex.
Rated: 3/4

From intricate backgrounds to propulsive fight choreography, everything is vividly rendered to perfection. Infinity Castle really looks like it belongs on the big screen. The problem is that it feels like it belongs on the small screen in some key aspects

Bounding Into Comics
Infinity Castle is one of the most action-packed and gorgeously animated films of the year. The film has an absorbing story, vastly interesting characters, and a finale that closes one exciting chapter while teasing the next and possibly bloodier one.
Rated: 4/5

Animation was great and the music during sequences were on-point. The half star off was because the flashbacks felt like they interrupted the flow of the fight scenes. Like just as your getting into it bam sad backstory. (Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like learning more about character‚Äôs pasts but‚Ä¶) Considering how much they are trying to pack in 2.5 hrs I get why they did it the way they did.

The fight scenes were amazing, animation was crisp with all the fine details. Others complained of being taken out of the fight scenes by flashbacks. I feel it helped with the backstory of all characters involved and didn't mess up the pacing of the overall story.
