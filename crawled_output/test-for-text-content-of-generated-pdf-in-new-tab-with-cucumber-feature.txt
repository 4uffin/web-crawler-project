I have a web application in Ruby on Rails which uses the wicked_pdf gem to render a PDF. A week ago the PDF rendering failed and my test suite running didn't show because a test was missing. The opened PDF above opens in a new tab so I want to test the PDF opening itself to be correctly rendering.
I actually am able to run cucumber tests for the click on the PDF link (which renders in a new tab) and double check that on the initial page shows a certain phrase. But if I want to check Then I should see "string_on_pdf" this fails. Probably the test suite is running the code not in the new tab with the PDF opened.
So my questions:
Is there a way in cucumber integration test to switch tabs to the PDF?
Can I then test for content with Then I should see on the PDF?

most pdf that are viewed are outside the rendering screen area only the sandboxed pixels are viewed so you would need a false pdf viewer like Firefox to allow reading the HTML false contents of a remote encoded PDF.
