How to effectively present a Kaggle loan approval prediction project with multiple graphs and model evaluation?

I trained machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) on the Kaggle Loan Approval Prediction dataset.
The Jupyter Notebook runs fine, and I already:
Performed EDA (distribution plots of applicant income, loan amount, assets, etc.)
Preprocessed data (handled missing values, label encoding, scaling)
Trained models and compared them with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Visualized results using a confusion matrix and classification reports
Now I’d like to present this project (to classmates and in my portfolio). My notebook generates a lot of graphs (asset value distributions, confusion matrix, etc.), but I’m not sure about the best way to structure the presentation.
What I’ve tried
Exported plots into a PowerPoint manually → works, but feels static.
Considered turning the Jupyter Notebook into a PDF → not very engaging.
Looked into Streamlit → could make it interactive, but I’m not sure how to structure it.
What I expected
I’d like advice on the best practices for presenting this kind of project. Should I:
Use PowerPoint (with code snippets, plots, and explanations)?
Build a small web app (e.g., with Streamlit)?
Stick with a polished Jupyter Notebook (Markdown + outputs)?
Basically: What’s the most effective way to present a machine learning project with many visualizations and evaluation metrics to different audiences?
