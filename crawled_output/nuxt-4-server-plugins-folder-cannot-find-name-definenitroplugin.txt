after upgrading to Nuxt 4 I get this Error.
Cannot find name 'defineNitroPlugin'
server/plugins/01.appInit.ts
export default defineNitroPlugin(async () => {...})
The code works fine but the typescript whispering doesn't.
Even If I want to import via aliases which work in other folders (even in other server folders) It doesn't work...
