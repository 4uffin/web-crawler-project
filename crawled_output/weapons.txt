Weapons
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Zach Cregger spins an expertly crafted yarn of terrifying mystery and thrilling intrigue in Weapons, a sophomore triumph that solidifies his status as a master of horror.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Loaded with bold elements that make it not just a great horror film, but a noteworthy film overall, Weapons is ultimately an impressive, genre-bending experience that’s original, entertaining, and satisfying despite its faint air of ambiguity.

Arizona Republic
This is definitely a horror movie, increasingly by the minute. It’s also really funny — in places — and the finale combines horror and comedy in a way that doesn’t cheapen either one.
Rated: 4.5/5

Justin Chang
NPR
Zach Cregger's ingenious and exultant new horror film is like a Stephen King riff on The Pied Piper of Hamelin, and it has a wonderful campfire-tale spookiness.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
It's a smorgasbord. It is a full meal of stuff and it doesn't all work, but there is enough in there that is genuinely kind of 'Oh Gosh!'...

John Serba
Decider
Cregger treads oh-so-carefully when it means it most, drawing an exquisite, everything’s-not-quite-all-right kind of non-conclusion that feels like the stuff of a true story.

Over-exposition kills the movie magic. There's no mystery left. Cregger understands that.

Stefania Sarrubba
Screensphere
For a rule-bending mystery elevated by its performances, Weapons disappointingly ends up caving to a dollar-store trope in a rather traditional resolution.
Rated: 3/5

It was difficult to say as there were 2 couples sitting next to us who didn’t shut up the whole movie. And when we politely asked them to be quiet they were extremely rude.
Also there was someone definitely vaporing weed during the movie.
You could smell it.
