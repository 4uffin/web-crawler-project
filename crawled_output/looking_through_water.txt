A predictable drama, failing to capture the vulnerability and forgiveness that define better father–son stories.
Rated: 3/10

“Looking Through Water” could use a bit more energy and intensity, but for those searching for something easy on the senses, the movie might work with its nonconfrontational ways.
Rated: B-

Looking Through Water speaks to the destructive power of holding on to old grudges and resentments as well as the need for open and honest communication in families. It also witnesses to the hope possible when healing is embraced.

An honest, wise and tender emotional journey well worth taking.
Looking Through Water is as powerful, poetic and engrossing as On Golden Pond.

‘…there’s always been a dynamism in the Douglas family performances, from Kirk to Michael and now to Cameron, and Looking Through Water harnesses that precious quality to power a fine, thoughtful drama about family love…'

Great movie!
Fantastic scenery, fishing, entertaining, well known actors, take you through sharing family drama in a way to reconnect with those you need most in your life.
With so many of us glued to our electronics these days, we need to be reminded, how a little bit of time and effort can change your whole perspective on your family dynamics.

Beautifully written and produced. Loved the personal interaction between the characters. There was action and
drama and an exciting display of the art of fly fishing. A true tribute to the sport and sportsmanship. Emotionally embracing, I even shed a tear.
Home run on all accounts.
