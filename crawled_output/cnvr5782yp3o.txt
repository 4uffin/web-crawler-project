"I thought that they were slightly incomprehensible comments that were totally inappropriate", the minister said.The tech billionaire also referred to massive uncontrolled migration and called for a change of government in the UK.Who is Tommy Robinson?Dozens of officers injured as up to 150,000 join Tommy Robinson rally'People are angry': Behind the wave of asylum hotel protestsSpeaking about Saturday's protests, Kyle said moments like these were "klaxon calls" for those in power to redouble their efforts to address the big concerns people have, including on immigration."What worries me most is the divisions in our society and other societies and other democratic societies ... it's not even the left and the right at the moment, " he told the programme.Figures like Robinson were able to "touch into a sense of disquiet and grievance in the community in our society", he said."A lot of it goes back to its roots in the financial crisis and the impact that had on communities around the country, and we haven't been able to bring our communities back together again since," Kyle continued.Met Police officers clash with protesters at Tommy Robinson rallyA huge policing operation was in place in London on Saturday, with the Met deploying 1,000 officers and drafting in help from other forces across England.Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said officers said: "There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence."Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, addressed the crowds where he criticised politicians for "parroting" his ideas.He also claimed UK courts had decided the rights of undocumented migrants superseded those of the "local community".Last month, the Court of Appeal overturned an injunction blocking asylum seekers being housed at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex.Robinson was released from prison earlier this year after being jailed in October for ignoring an order not to repeat false claims about a Syrian refugee, who had successfully sued him for libel.British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
