Why do I see a space between two columns with images and i cant reduce the space between columns?

I want my 6 images to be in two columns and 3 images in one column and 3 images in another column, but when I order them by columns there is a space between the two columns and when you move them, the space gets bigger. I am a beginner and im building my portfolio and i encounter this problem.
First i wrote the img inside of the container.
<div class="skill-pictures">
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/HTML.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/CSS.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/JavaScript.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/Github.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/API.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/PowerBi.png" alt="" />
</div>
Then, I used grid and grid-template-columns to define two columns with three images each. I assigned them size and height and used the block to remove the extra space between the images.
.skill-pictures {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 3fr);
gap: 10px;
justify-content: center;
}
.skill-pictures img {
width: 150px;
height: auto;
display: block;
margin-left: 70%;
}
I've tried reducing the width, but it only reduces the size of the images. What I want is for the two columns to be next to each other on the right side.
I'm not uploading an image because last time I was denied due to an image, but I hope you understand my problem.
