I want my 6 images to be in two columns and 3 images in one column and 3 images in another column, but when I order them by columns there is a space between the two columns and when you move them, the space gets bigger. I am a beginner and im building my portfolio and i encounter this problem.
First i wrote the img inside of the container.
<div class="skill-pictures">
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/HTML.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/CSS.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/JavaScript.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/Github.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/API.png" alt="" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/PowerBi.png" alt="" />
</div>
Then, I used grid and grid-template-columns to define two columns with three images each. I assigned them size and height and used the block to remove the extra space between the images.
.skill-pictures {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 3fr);
gap: 10px;
justify-content: center;
}
.skill-pictures img {
width: 150px;
height: auto;
display: block;
margin-left: 70%;
}
I've tried reducing the width, but it only reduces the size of the images. What I want is for the two columns to be next to each other on the right side.
I'm not uploading an image because last time I was denied due to an image, but I hope you understand my problem.

Using margin-left: 70% on the images causes each image to shift to the right within its own column. Since there are two columns, the second column also moves to the right by the same amount, which increases the space between the columns. Instead of applying margin-left to the images, it's better to align the entire container to the right using justify-content: end or justify-content: flex-end, and leave the images without any specific margin.

Please don’t present “answers” in the form of a game of spot-the-difference. Explain how to solve the problem using English.
