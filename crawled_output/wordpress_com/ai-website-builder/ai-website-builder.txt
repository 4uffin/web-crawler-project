What are the benefits of the AI website builder?
The AI website builder saves you time and effort by handling the technical and design aspects of website creation. It gives you a professional, personalized site without the need for coding skills or hiring a developer.
What kinds of sites can I create with an AI website builder?
Our AI-powered website builder can generate a wide range of websites — from personal blogs and professional portfolios to service pages and a site for your business. With AI tools guiding the process, you can quickly create a mobile-friendly, SEO-friendly website that matches your goals.
How is an AI website builder different from a regular web page builder?
While traditional web page builders often require manual design work, an AI-powered website builder generates a complete site — layouts, images, and text — for you based on your input. You can then fine-tune the design and content to get a professional website with AI efficiency.
How does AI help with website design?
AI for website design speeds up the process of creating professional, mobile-friendly, and SEO-friendly layouts. It suggests styles, color palettes, and even generates text, so you can focus on fine-tuning and launching your site faster.
How long does it take to create a website with AI?
You can create a functional website in just minutes, as the AI website builder handles the design and content setup for you. With minimal input, you’ll have a polished site ready to go in no time.
How does the AI website builder work?
The builder asks you a few simple questions about your website’s purpose and design preferences. Using this input, it generates a complete website with layouts, images, and text, which you can further refine as needed.
Can I still customize my site?
Yes, the AI provides a solid foundation, but you have full control to tweak layouts, colors, fonts, and content. This flexibility ensures your website perfectly matches your vision and brand.
Can I generate a website with AI for free?
Yes. Our AI website builder offers a free tier that lets you create an AI-generated website using 30 prompts at no cost. You can explore different website designs, test AI tools, and build the foundation of your website. Get unlimited prompts and launch your site with a Premium or Business plan.
Do AI website builders support ecommerce functionalities?
At launch, the AI website builder is focused on creating blogs, portfolios, and service-based websites. Ecommerce functionality will not be available initially, but future updates may expand its capabilities. In the meantime, you can add ecommerce features by installing a plugin — available with the WordPress.com Business plan.
Can I connect a custom domain to my AI-built website?
Yes, you can link your custom domain to your website, giving it a professional and branded web address. This feature helps establish credibility and makes it easier for your audience to find you.
What happens after I launch my website?
You can continue to update, edit, and add content whenever you need. The AI website builder grows with your vision.
