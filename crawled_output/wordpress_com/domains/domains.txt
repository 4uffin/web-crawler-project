Everything you need to know
Learn more about custom domains with WordPress.com.
What is a domain name?
A domain name is the human-friendly address people type into their browsers when they’re trying to get to your website, like my-website.com.
Websites rely on the domain name system (DNS), which uses numeric addresses to route traffic all over the world wide web. Domain names are assigned to those numeric addresses to make it easier for humans to remember and locate individual websites.
Can I use a domain purchased through WordPress.com with other hosts?
Absolutely. With our robust DNS service and easy to use tools you can host your site anywhere you like. You can even host your domain at one host and your email at another.
Can I transfer a domain I already own to WordPress.com?
Sure! Once you’ve created an account you can transfer as many eligible domains as you’d like to WordPress.com. And remember: you don’t need to host your site here just to transfer your domain to us.
What’s the difference between a domain and a website?
They work together but are two distinct things. Think of your domain name as your address or location on a map, and your website as your home or store, where you keep your things.
Can I have more than one domain for the same site?
Many experts recommend that you do. Whether for personal or business needs, if your online identity is important to you then you want to have alternate spellings or common typographical errors. Do you have unique products or services? Grab the domain name for them!
How can I find a great business name as a domain name?
You can use our advanced Business Name Generator to find the best fit for your business. It generates multiple names for you to choose from, and once you settle on a name, you can claim it for your business. Don’t forget to also claim social handles for your business so your customers can find you everywhere.
