How does Automattic for Agencies handle different agency sizes and specializations?
Automattic for Agencies recognizes the diversity in agency sizes and specializations and is planning to handle this by offering a tiered program that caters to various levels of agency development and needs with:

These tools are geared towards helping them further develop their skills and manage sites more efficiently. This level of support ensures that smaller agencies are not disadvantaged and can grow their capabilities in tandem with their client base.
Advancement within the Program: As an agency supports more sites and influences more revenue at Automattic, effectively indicating growth and a larger book of business, they can move up within the program. This advancement comes with additional benefits, including the potential for access to a dedicated partner manager, sales support, advanced training, and more resources.
