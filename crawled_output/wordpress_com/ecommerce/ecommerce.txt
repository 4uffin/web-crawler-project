Everything youneed to know
What’s included in the WordPress.com Commerce plan?
Simply put: Everything you need to create a powerful, profitable website to sell products and/or services. Here’s a full list of extensions and features included in the plan.
What is Hosted Woo?
Hosted Woo is an all-in-one, cloud-based service that takes care of the technical side of running a WooCommerce store — so you can focus on selling.It includes website hosting, automatic updates, and built-in tools for everything from payment processing and inventory management to customer tracking and sales analytics. Hosted Woo provides the flexibility of WooCommerce without the complexity of managing servers and maintaining software.Whether you’re launching your first product or scaling an established brand, Hosted Woo gives you the power of WooCommerce — fully managed and optimized for performance, security, and ease of use.
Can I create a website in another language?
Absolutely. You can change your site’s language for visitors, set a different language for your dashboard, and write in any language you like.
Will I have to pay for a custom domain?
Your free website includes a subdomain (sitename.wordpress.com). You can register a new custom domain or transfer an existing one to your free site, but you’ll need a paid WordPress.com plan to use it as your site’s main address. Without a plan, your custom domain will simply redirect visitors to your free subdomain.
Can I get an email account?
Yes! Try Professional Email free for three months or choose the Google Workspace productivity and collaboration suite.
Will I be able to sell online?
You can sell individual items on your site using your PayPal account. For more opportunities to monetize, upgrade to the WordPress.com Premium plan to sell products and services using the Simple Payment button. For more ecommerce features, like an online store, consider starting with a WordPress.com Business plan.
Can I import content from another platform?
It is possible to import your blog content from a variety of other blogging platforms, including Blogger, LiveJournal, Movable Type, Tumblr, Wix, Typepad, Xanga, and more. You can also import your content from a self‑hosted WordPress site.
Where can I learn more?
Please visit our support site for tutorials and additional information.
