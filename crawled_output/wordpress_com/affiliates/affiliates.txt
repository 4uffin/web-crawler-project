What is an affiliate program, and who is it for?
An affiliate program is a partnership that allows for individuals or brands (affiliates) to earn commissions by promoting another company’s products or services. Becoming an affiliate is a great option for anyone interested in making money online through promotion, including bloggers, influencers, business owners, and more.
How does the WordPress.com Affiliate Program work?
WordPress.com products are a part of the Automattic Affiliate Program. Join the program right from this page and your details will be verified by our team as soon as possible. Once you’re approved, you can start creating affiliate campaigns across all of Automattic’s products, including WordPress.com—all from one dashboard.
What makes WordPress.com and the Automattic Affiliate Program unique?
WordPress.com offers a number of products and services that you can promote and earn from, including domains, website hosting, our professional website design service, Pressable, and WP Jobs Manager.
And because WordPress.com is a part of Automattic, you’ll be able to use the same affiliate account and dashboard to promote open-source, trustworthy, profitable brands like WooCommerce Marketplace, Jetpack, and Akismet.
How much can I get paid?
Your earnings are only limited by the number of products you choose to promote and how much affiliate traffic you drive to them. You can review the full-term details for each brand after signing up.
How will I get paid?
Once you’ve set up your details, you’ll automatically receive regular payments based on the performance of your campaigns.
You can track your success with any of the products you’re promoting from a single dashboard, so you’ll always know what to expect.
What’s the difference between the Automattic Affiliate Program and the Automattic for Agencies Program? Can I join both?
The Automattic Affiliate Program provides an opportunity for content creators, influencers, educators, businesses, or anyone with an audience to earn additional income by promoting Automattic products, including WordPress.com, WooCommerce Marketplace, Pressable, Sensei, WP Job Manager, Jetpack, and more. The program is designed for those creating content to easily generate commissions and earn one-time, lump-sum payments for every referral.
Automattic for Agencies, on the other hand, is designed for agencies who sell custom, 1:1 solutions based on a client’s unique needs. This would typically involve recommending, implementing, and managing Automattic products—including WordPress.com, WooCommerce, WordPress VIP, Pressable, and Jetpack—on behalf of their clients. The program has been set up to offer a suite of tools and services that streamline the website management process for multi-user teams and expand revenue opportunities through profit sharing and bulk discounts.
It’s certainly possible to join both programs, taking advantage of the benefits of each one to target different audiences, but members will need to make sure they’re following the respective guidelines. Agencies in particular should note that if they’re hosting a client’s site through their Automattic for Agencies account, they can’t simultaneously receive affiliate commissions for that same client. We recommend taking a look at the terms of service for more details.
Where can Automattic affiliates find support resources?
Check out the Automattic Affiliate Program’s Knowledge Base for all the support and guidance you need. Whether you’re just starting out with affiliate marketing or looking for detailed product information and promotional strategies, you’ll find everything to help you succeed.
Who can I talk to for help with other questions?
We’re here for it. If you have any questions, email us at affiliates@automattic.com, and we’d be happy to help.
