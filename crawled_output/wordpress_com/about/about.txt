About Us
At WordPress.com, our mission is to democratize publishing and ecommerce one website at a time.
We’re a hosted version of the open source software, WordPress. Because when you have the freedom to create, express yourself, and earn money online, the impossible becomes business as usual.
What We Believe
Anyone can have an idea. We want you to have the power and support to get it online.
Better products for a better web.
We’re trying to create a better web. An internet you can feel good about using. A place where people and ideas come together freely and openly.
Everyone has a voice.
Ideas don’t belong behind high walls. Software and your posts shouldn’t either. We’re here to help you express yourself.
Real support from real people.
Customer service isn’t something we offer. It’s who we are. We call it Happiness—real support delivered by real human beings.
Freedom and ownership.
Whether it’s a blog, store, portfolio, or something entirely different, you have the freedom to create a site that fits you, and own all of your content and data too.
You can make something that matters.
With simple tools for designing and building your site, securely hosting it, and finding your audience, you can have a website that grows with you.
Who We Are
We’re as diverse as the websites our customers create.
We work on improving WordPress.com and developing products that help our customers find new ways to do things online. At Automattic, we roll out updates almost every day and offer other services—from WooCommerce and Jetpack to Gravatar, Simplenote, and WordPress VIP—all to enhance your experience on the web.
Our Network
WordPress.com is part of a community of creators, bloggers, business owners, community organizers, our supportive people, and customers like you.
