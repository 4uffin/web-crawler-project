Finding the right name
Keep it simple
Imagine you’re telling someone your business name in a noisy cafe. Are they going to ask you to repeat or spell it three times?
Make it memorable
You have only seconds to stand out. Think about a name that captures or plays with the personality, purpose, or kind of products you sell.
Step up and own it
A great name carries a lot more weight when you own the domain. Tighten up your shortlist by checking what’s available.
Build your brand
A name’s just the start. Seal the deal with a custom domain name, logo, and professional email address

How can I come up with a good name?
Inspiration is everywhere. Jot down a bunch of ideas and whittle down from there. From memorably simple to pithy and descriptive, the best ideas appear when we’ve rattled off the worst ideas.
What if a business name I like is already taken?
If you really love the name, you could try tracking down the current owner to see if you can buy the domain name from them, but if that’s not an option, explore new names with the generator to find something more unique and set your business apart.
I’ve decided on a business name, what’s next?
Seal the deal with a custom domain name—a unique address for your website that puts your stamp on it in seconds
If you don’t already have a website, you can easily build a beautiful site on WordPress.com and connect it right up to your new domain with any paid plan
Now you’ve laid claim to your domain, grab your username on social media, so customers can find you everywhere
