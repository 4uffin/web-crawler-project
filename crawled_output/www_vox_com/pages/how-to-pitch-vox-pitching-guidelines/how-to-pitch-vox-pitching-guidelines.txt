Our mission is help you understand what really matters.Our staff of journalists and subject-matter experts research, report and produce articles, videos, and podcasts that make complex ideas accessible. Whether it’s politics, policy, culture, democracy, animal welfare, biodiversity, artificial intelligence, the climate crisis, or how to live a better life, we give context to what’s happening today.Freelance pitches for written pieces are accepted by many of our sections; pitch guidelines and contact information can be found below. All accepted stories go through a collaborative editorial process and are paid at competitive rates, which are based on the amount and type of work.Submission guidelinesA good pitch consists of a concise description of the piece you would like to write; aim for a couple of paragraphs here. We are looking for pieces with strong, unique angles. Specifics are important! Tell us the whats of the story, but also the whys: why this story is important to cover now, and why you should be the one to write it. Please add information on any pre-reporting you’ve done and source access you have; diverse sourcing is of paramount importance to Vox. A proposed headline and word count should also be included.In addition to your pitch description, please tell us a bit about yourself and your work (just a line or so will suffice!), and provide links to pieces you’ve previously published that are similar to your pitch in subject and/or form.Put all of this in the body of your email — no attachments, please — and remember that how you write your pitch gives editors insight into the quality and style of your writing. We rarely accept already-written pieces, as we like to work with writers on shaping their stories from start to finish.We are not looking for:Q&As, unless you have access to a hard-to-get subject and a compelling reason to use the Q&A formatTraditional reviews of books, TV shows, movies, albums, or other cultural productsShopping roundupsManuscripts or academic papersWhat are we looking for? Read on for section-by-section instructions. Please note that many sections are not currently taking freelance pitches, but that we update this page regularly.Future Perfect Future Perfect covers the world’s biggest, most neglected moral and technological problems, and the philosophical debates around how to do the most good. Its work is animated by a baseline question: What would we write about if our only job was to cover the most important and yet oddly neglected stories in the world? Future Perfect’s core coverage areas include:Global poverty and public healthThe catastrophic and existential threats, both natural and technological, that humanity facesAnimal welfare, factory farming, and the future of meatThe growth of progress studies and evidence-based ideas that can boost sustainable growth for allThe frontiers of artificial intelligence and biotechnologyThe philosophies and practices surrounding philanthropy and altruism Moral philosophy and the ethical questions that underpin individual and policy choices Future Perfect welcomes freelance contributions. Most stories run between 1,500 and 2,500 words, and pitches can be sent to futureperfectfreelance@vox.com.ClimateAt Vox’s climate section, we’re looking for stories that offer clarity and understanding of the climate crisis so we can empower readers as we learn to live with, adapt to, and fight against climate change and its often devastating impacts. We’re hungry for brave and surprising angles that clarify the causes, impacts, and stakes of a changing climate, and give audiences more agency.We want stories that embrace nuance and explain. And we want you to interpret those ideas broadly to encompass anything from powerful service journalism to explainers that unpack complicated policy or show how extreme weather phenomena connect to the bigger picture. We’re also interested in gorgeous narratives of community resilience and stories that inspire hope for or awe of the natural world.Right now, we’re especially interested in climate stories that explore the intersection of biodiversity and traditional ecological knowledge; labor, daily life, and housing; coexistence and new frameworks for conservation; the green energy transition; politics; and solutions, adaptation, and resilience. Story assignments range from 800 to 2,500 words and encompass many formats. If you think you’ve got an idea that will resonate with our readers, send your pitch to climate@vox.com.How we’ll work togetherIf we’re interested in your pitch, we’ll discuss rates, deadlines, scope, kill fees (if applicable), and other expectations with you upfront.
