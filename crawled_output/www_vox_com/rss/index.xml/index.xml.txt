<p class="has-text-align-none">Jimmy Kimmel wasn’t suspended because of poor ratings. He wasn’t suspended because he crossed some ethical red line. He was suspended because the president of the United States decided to make an example of him.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The supposed justification came on Kimmel’s Monday night show. “We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said in his monologue. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There was little evidence at the time to think the shooter was a MAGA supporter, as Kimmel’s comment seemed to imply, and nothing we’ve learned since suggests otherwise. If anything, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/us/kirk-shooting-suspect-ideology-partner.html">evidence points in the opposite direction</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But democracies are supposed to absorb careless speech. Bad jokes, bad takes, even vile remarks are the price of a free society. And the whole point of the First Amendment is to take the government out of the business of deciding what we can and can’t hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjhoMGxra29nNmkiLCJwIjoiL3BvbGl0aWNzLzQ2MTg4Ny9qaW1teS1raW1tZWwtc3VzcGVuc2lvbi1haXItYWJjLWNoYXJsaWUta2lyay1uZXhzdGFyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5MzczNTQzLCJpYXQiOjE3NTgxNjM5NDN9.YM3GMYWJWySd9trlimPmYwiNoO-8KQ_Sth7eMJ9pICM&amp;utm_medium=gift-link&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_campaign=SSSCOTUSTrumpsTeam&amp;ueid=10b3a670165430d31fdd98f5af631883&amp;utm_term=Highly%20engaged%20non-contribs">Zack Beauchamp</a> argued, Kimmel’s suspension represents a remarkably brazen attack on free speech. And if it succeeds in setting the precedent that presidents can use regulators to muzzle their enemies, we’re in a political emergency. Because free expression is more than a democratic value. It’s the foundation that makes every other value possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But none of what’s happening should surprise us. The same openness that allows dissent and satire is also what makes democratic societies vulnerable to demagogues who can exploit them — what my co-author Zac Gershberg and I called in our book on the subject the “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo146792768.html">paradox of democracy</a>.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So there will always be moments when a culture that prides itself on tolerating every kind of speech will eventually have to decide whether it also tolerates efforts to silence speech. This is one of those moments.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How democratic spaces can give way to antidemocratic forces</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What we’re seeing in the Kimmel case has precedents that go all the way back to the dawn of democracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Athens, the open legal forum that allowed Socrates to question authority also gave his enemies the power to put him on trial for “corrupting the youth.” The very openness that made debate possible also created the space for repressive forces to weaponize the system against him.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Weimar Germany, the explosion of film, radio, and print paved the way for new art and progressive ideas, but those same media were quickly turned into tools of mass propaganda by Joseph Goebbels, drowning democratic culture in authoritarian messaging.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the US today, the regulatory framework designed to safeguard open broadcasting is being wielded to punish a critic of the president. And more broadly, the same wide-open information environment that underpins free expression has made it possible for MAGA and its allies to increasingly dominate the public square — amplifying conspiracy theories, overwhelming fact-based journalism, and eroding the very conditions for shared reality.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Steve Bannon openly bragged about “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation">flooding the zone with shit</a>,” exploiting the sheer volume of the open information environment to break the press. President Donald Trump’s continual <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/26/13417532/donald-trump-lies">torrent of lies</a> works the same way. And hostile actors abroad — from <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/12/17/18145075/russia-facebook-twitter-internet-research-agency-race">Russia’s troll farms</a> wading into the 2016 US election to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/11/china-is-using-tiktok-for-influence-campaigns-odni-says-00146336">Chinese disinformation campaigns</a> on TikTok sowing division today — have learned to infiltrate these same open channels to destabilize democracies.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of us celebrated the collapse of media gatekeepers and the rise of a free-for-all, digital public square in the 21st century. In its early days, the internet was hailed as a democratizing force. But the same qualities that made it feel liberating — openness, access, immediacy — also made it ripe for exploitation.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no easy way to resolve this tension. Free expression is both democracy’s strength and its weakness.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How much do Americans truly value free expression?</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the liberal imagination, free speech is a neutral principle that guarantees a fair contest of ideas, protecting all sides equally. The post-liberal right and MAGA Republicans treat it like a weapon. Speech is power, and judging by their rhetoric and actions this past week, they’re happy to police it when it serves their side.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">From their perspective, this is all fair game. Liberals, they say, aren’t really committed to free speech either. They sat by as their allies on the left brought the hammer of repression on “incorrect” beliefs for the last decade or more. They feel justified in using state power the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s truth in this critique. The left has its own illiberal reflexes. Cancel campaigns, deplatforming, disinvitations — from <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/03/middlebury-students-shout-down-lecture-charles-murray">Middlebury students</a> shouting down Charles Murray to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/media/new-york-times-tom-cotton-op-ed">New York Times staffers</a> revolting over an op-ed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/us/hamline-university-islam-prophet-muhammad.html">Hamline University</a> dismissing an art-history professor for showing images of the Prophet Muhammad — the left has had its turn at enforcing orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the difference is that the right now wields the machinery of government to enforce their reflexes in ways Democratic administrations have not done in any comparable way. We’re not talking about sophomores at Wesleyan storming the quad for Palestine.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the crucial distinction, and how we’ve arrived at this juncture, where institutions powerful enough to shape the public square are giving way to political pressure.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s what happened here. Nexstar — which owns roughly 200 stations across the country — and ABC didn’t even attempt to defend their own autonomy. They apparently calculated that fighting the government was too costly, especially with billions in merger approvals on the line. So they surrendered. And when institutions with that much power fold, it sends a message to everyone else: Don’t push too far, don’t mock the wrong person, don’t risk your future. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Which is why you don’t have to care about Jimmy Kimmel to care about what just happened. The point isn’t whether you think his monologue was funny or offensive or worse. The point is whether you’re comfortable with the president of the United States using regulatory threats to remove a critic from national television. If the government can do it to Kimmel, it can — and eventually will — do it to anyone who stumbles over the wrong line.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump got to where he is because he saw a vulnerability in our system. In a media environment like this, shamelessness is a superpower. You can push the bounds of polite discourse and flood the zone with bullshit as long as you have no scruples. And now, having benefited from the openness of our public square, he&#8217;s slamming the gates shut behind him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar">Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension</a> — the direct result of an FCC threat to pull the licenses of networks that aired him —&nbsp;has shown us how authoritarianism can come to America.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I mean this literally. The specific threats that Federal Communications Commission head Brendan Carr made against networks, involving a little-used doctrine called “<a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/fcc-chair-brendan-carr-abc-jimmy-kimmel/">news distortion</a>,” show how easy it is to weaponize vaguely worded statutes and the executive’s discretionary powers against the president’s enemies. Such tools can also be used to reward friends — to provide regulatory favors, like merger approvals and exemptions from tariffs — who  toe a politically correct line.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is how authoritarianism has taken root in other democracies, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump">most notably Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán</a>. And from the get-go, President Donald Trump’s second term had been <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/398068/trump-musk-power-grab-hungary-orban">moving the United States down this road</a>. But for much of the time his efforts appeared <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/410966/trump-democracy-100-days-losing">too haphazard and poorly planned</a> to produce a <em>consolidated</em> authoritarian regime — meaning one that could durably compromise the basic ability of its opponents to contest elections under reasonably fair conditions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But in the past few weeks, a series of developments —&nbsp;most notably, but not exclusively, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/on-the-right-newsletter/461722/charlie-kirk-killing-trump-vance-miller-free-speech-cancel">authoritarian energies unleashed</a> after Charlie Kirk’s death — have revealed a disturbingly credible policy pathway to power consolidation. We can now see how American Orbánism could take full root before the 2028 elections. We now know what a Trump-led authoritarian state in America would look like — and how we would get there from here.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a future would unfold in roughly four parts.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, using hiring and firing powers to purge career civil servants from key agencies, like the Justice Department, and erode the traditional barriers preventing undue political influence on law enforcement and regulatory decisions. We saw this in the DOGE cuts, in the appointment of political hacks like Carr and Pam Bondi to top positions, and (most recently) Trump’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-poised-fire-us-attorney-resisting-effort-charge/story?id=125700904">move to fire a federal prosecutor</a> who refused to file politically motivated charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, using the power of these newly Trumpified agencies to target dissent in civil society — a broadening of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/421954/columbia-brown-harvard-trump-settlement-antisemitism">assaults on Ivy League universities</a>. This would include following through on threats to use <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/politics/trump-rico-liberal-groups">racketeering charges</a> against liberal NGOs and going after other prominent critics the way they went after Kimmel.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Third, bullying and bribing large corporations until significant economic power is concentrated in the hands of regime allies dependent on the president’s goodwill for their survival. To a degree, this is already happening —  see Trump’s habits of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-tariffs-exemptions-pet-lobbyists-asbestos-confusion-secrecy">granted tariff exemptions to connected companies</a> or using the <a href="https://www.promarket.org/2025/08/11/trump-is-weaponizing-antitrust-and-regulation-us-consumers-will-suffer/">threat of antitrust enforcement</a> to bend CBS to its will. In an authoritarian America, such politicization would be expanded and deepened to the point where any corporation that crossed the White House would expect to pay a crippling financial cost.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Fourth, turn this accumulated power against the political opposition — turning elections into facially free contests where, in fact, Democrats face enormously unfair hurdles (and would likely be unable to govern even if they managed to succeed). This began with a nationwide push for <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/422532/texas-redistricting-mid-decade-gerrymander-abbott-democrat-trump-explained">mid-cycle redistricting</a>, but would require further steps (like turning the Justice Department <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-actblue-democratic-fundraising-9f990e668572709ce0e3260bbdb6f61b">investigation into the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue</a> into actual criminal charges).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point in the Trump administration, only the first has been accomplished to any significant degree. The efforts in other areas have been of limited effectiveness, stymied both by the courts and the Trump team’s incompetence.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But recently, and especially in the immediate wake of Kirk’s death, the administration has taken startling new swings in the second and third areas. If these efforts succeed, the fourth will become a live possibility: That is, we could be living in a country whose elections are no longer free and fair in any meaningful sense.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There is still plenty of time to prevent this future. Much depends on whether the Trump administration can get better at the nuts and bolts of lawfare, developing tactics that avoid legal hurdles or provoking a potent backlash. Acts of courage in Congress, the courts, the streets, and even corporate boardrooms could stymie Trump until at least the midterms.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the risk of authoritarian consolidation is real and growing. Now that the endgame is clear, it’s time for all of us to start thinking about how to stop it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The anatomy of American authoritarianism</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The kind of authoritarianism I fear is emerging in the United States, which political scientists call “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/6/15/22522504/republicans-authoritarianism-trump-competitive">competitive authoritarianism</a>,” doesn’t involve the outright criminalization of the opposition or formal martial law. Instead, it depends on perverting the law, modifying and twisting it with the intent of incrementally undermining the opposition’s ability to compete fairly in elections.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a government can be constructed along the lines of what Princeton University’s Kim Lane Scheppele calls a “<a href="https://www.democratic-erosion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Scheppele-2013.pdf">Frankenstate</a>:” that is, “an abusive form of rule, created by combining the bits and pieces of perfectly reasonable democratic institutions in monstrous ways. … No one part is objectionable; the horror emerges from the combinations.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It is probably necessary, for example, to give the president a degree of discretion when it comes to policy areas that affect national security. It is also true that tariffs are often just taxes, not a tool for authoritarian control.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But when you combine those two things — creating <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/guide-trumps-section-232-tariffs-nine-maps">a situation</a> where the president has wide latitude to raise tariffs and provide exemptions to them on vague national security grounds —&nbsp;you create a situation where it’s all too easy for the president to weaponize his powers against corporations that cross his administration politically.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Frankenstate targets opposition parties through burdensome tax audits, dubious criminal investigations, and uneven application of campaign finance regulations. It also focuses on attacking the civil <em>foundations</em> of the opposition —&nbsp;meaning attacking the donors who might fund them, the activist groups who might stand up for their rights, and the free media they depend on to get their message out.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Silence or coopt enough of these voices, and the ruling party doesn’t actually have to outlaw political opposition or stuff ballot boxes. The opposition will simply be weak enough that letting them compete poses little threat.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So what would this look like in the United States?</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/gettyimages-2217852566.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0.0063243106501432,0,99.9873513787,100" alt="In the Oval Office, Trump sits at his desk with Elon Musk beside him" title="In the Oval Office, Trump sits at his desk with Elon Musk beside him" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Elon Musk speaks alongside President Donald Trump to reporters in the Oval Office on May 30, 2025. | Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In this America, corporations depend on the goodwill of the White House to remain profitable&nbsp;— depending on White House tariff exemptions and staying in the good graces of policitized regulators to avoid crippling punishments. Liberal billionaires like George Soros, Warren Buffett, and Mark Cuban would be made into examples:&nbsp;their corporate interests targeted by antitrust regulators and tax enforcement, while corrupt Justice Department attorneys would launch selective civil and even criminal charges against them personally. The rest of the billionaire class, getting the message, would largely avoid funding liberal causes, let alone the Democratic Party.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In this America, the press would be owned —&nbsp;in large part, though not entirely — by the regime’s favored and trusted oligarchs. These individuals would be able to control what enough Americans see to swing several percentage points of marginal voters from the “persuadable” to “solid R” column, putting Democrats at a severe disadvantage.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And in this America, what remains of the independent media and liberal activist class would be subject to the same kind of harassment directed at left-leaning billionaires. Fighting back would drain valuable resources Democrats would require to overcome their other financial and attentional disadvantages, creating near-insurmountable barriers to national viability.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a future may sound impossible. But recently, the Trump administration has taken specific actions that could —&nbsp;left unchecked — would bring us far too close to comfort.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How we get there from here</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First is a pursuit of media control, which goes well beyond censoring Kimmel. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced that it had struck a deal with China that would <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/tiktok-buyers-group-to-include-oracle-silver-lake-andreessen">spin off TikTok USA</a> as a separate entity. Eighty percent would be owned by three US firms — two of which, Andreessen Horowitz and Oracle, are themselves controlled by Trump-aligned billionaires.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Oracle’s owner, Larry Ellison, is partnering with his son David to build a broader media empire. David owns CBS; he is reportedly about to buy Bari Weiss’ the Free Press and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cbs-news-david-ellison-bari-weiss-b2827230.html">put the anti-woke conservative</a> in charge of CBS as well. The Ellisons are also in serious discussion to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/opinion/larry-ellison-paramount-cbs-tiktok.html">purchase Warner Bros. Discovery</a> — which operates, among other properties, CNN and HBO.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Two independent journalistic voices, CBS News and CNN, could soon be combined into something potentially almost unrecognizable, something way too close to what is served up on a daily basis by the Murdochs,” the business journalist William D. Cohan writes in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/opinion/larry-ellison-paramount-cbs-tiktok.html">the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Imagine all of this together not just with the Murdoch network, but Jeff Bezos’ right-wing remaking of the Washington Post, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5279570/meta-trump-settlement-facebook-instagram-suspensions">Mark Zuckerberg’s pro-Trump turn</a>, and Elon Musk’s control over X.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The government and its allies would have control over a massive portion of the informational landscape for young and old Americans — encompassing unprecedented portions of television, digital, and social media, plus what remains of print. The vast nature of their empires would make them dependent on the goodwill of increasingly politicized regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, meaning that they would have powerful incentives to ensure their audiences were getting Trump-friendly content.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This would matter a great deal. High-quality political science research has <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~sdellavi/wp/FoxVoteQJEAug07.pdf">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160812">demonstrated</a> that Fox News significantly increased the GOP’s vote share, the effect large enough to swing presidential elections. Now imagine not one Fox, but several — spreading regime-friendly propaganda across new and old media.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats might try to compensate by leaning on activists and donors. But the Trump administration has long signaled an intent to attack those: In April, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/investigation-into-unlawful-straw-donor-and-foreign-contributions-in-american-elections/">opened an sketchy investigation into ActBlue</a>, by far the most important Democratic platform for political donations in the country. The investigation will issue a report next month; it is possible some attempt at charges will follow.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2232068201.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="US Attorney General Pam Bondi speaking in front of a DOJ podium." title="US Attorney General Pam Bondi speaking in front of a DOJ podium." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US Attorney General Pam Bondi. | Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The ActBlue investigation began before Kirk’s death. Since then, the Trump administration has engaged in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461254/charlie-kirk-shooting-trump-radical-left-violence">campaign of incitement</a> against liberal activists and donors — alleging, with absolutely no evidence, that they played some role in radicalizing Kirk’s killer. Now Stephen Miller, perhaps the most important White House policy official, is vowing to wield the power of the state to crush them.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The last message that Charlie sent me was…that we need to have an organized strategy to go after the left-wing organizations that are promoting violence in this country. And I will write those words on my heart and I will carry them out,” <a href="https://x.com/theblaze/status/1967629142318285005">Miller said</a> during a podcast taping with Vice President JD Vance. “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have to [at] the DOJ, DHS, and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks. It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie’s name.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Defiance, <em>collective</em> defiance, can make a big difference.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During that taping, Vance specifically named two large liberal organizations — the Open Society Foundation, funded by billionaire George Soros, and the Ford Foundation — as potential targets of Trump’s wrath. Now, the administration is preparing specific plans to go after these organizations. The Wall Street Journal reports that they are planning to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/charlie-kirk-shooting-death-republican-reaction-456d6237?mod=politics_lead_story">strip liberal groups of their tax-exempt status</a>; Trump is openly talking about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/politics/trump-rico-liberal-groups">prosecuting Soros under the RICO Act</a>, an anti-racketeering law primarily used against organized crime.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration does not need to win in court for such cases to end up as strategic victories. If they can impose steep litigation costs, or successfully inhibit the operation of liberal groups during the process of litigation, they will have <em>already</em> weakened the opposition. They would then put their opponents in a no-win situation: either have their resources tied up in court while trying to vindicate their rights, or else choose to fold and negotiate a surrender package.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the playbook that they ran against universities, with real and continuing success.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Harvard, the principal institution fighting back, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html">suffered severely</a> <em>even though</em> it keeps winning in court. Despite its pushback, the school has still given the White House some of what it wants and has been widely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/23/us/harvard-changes-academic-freedom-trump-deal.html">reported to be negotiating</a> a broader settlement. Meanwhile, the first institution to capitulate — Columbia — has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/nyregion/columbia-trump-settlement-what-to-know.html">surrendered both money and institutional autonomy</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This “heads I win, tails you lose” dynamic shows how Trumpian lawfare could, if applied as aggressively as the administration has been threatening since Kirk’s death, end up starving the Democratic Party of vital resources ahead of the 2028 presidential election. The tactic could even be used to punish the independent press, as we’ve seen with Trump’s recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5543030/donald-trump-nytimes-lawsuit">lawsuits targeting the New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5482955/trump-epstein-murdoch-deposition-lawsuit">the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether all this would be enough to tip America over into a full-blown competitive authoritarian regime like Hungary’s is tough to say. But that’s by design: In such a Frankenstate, the entire government system is built such that each individual action can seem democratic (at least, on a surface level). The Trump regime would need this to give room for GOP partisans, who do not see themselves as authoritarian, to rationalize what’s happening in democratic terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Without clear benchmarks like the abolition of elections, it’s impossible to tell precisely when democracy has been lost.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to fight back</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s easy to read all this and think the fight for democracy is already lost. The Supreme Court is controlled by a 6-3 conservative majority <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/460270/supreme-court-republican-partisan-hacks-donald-trump">in thrall to Trump</a>, and Democrats are a minority in both houses of Congress until <em>at least</em> the 2026 midterms. Aren’t we just cooked?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To which I say: No! This attitude is part of the problem.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The slide toward competitive authoritarianism in America depends, crucially, on acquiescence — on the idea that people are unwilling to bear the costs of standing up to each individual attack on liberty before they can combine into true authoritarian control over society.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even <a href="https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/the-authoritarian-checklist">the most pessimistic assessments</a> would say we’re not there yet: that Trump can’t pull something like what he did with Kimmel and expect to avoid mass pushback. That doesn’t mean a wave of popular and media protest will soon win Kimmel back his job. But Trump is <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/trump-approval-tracker">immensely unpopular</a>, and Republicans are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-history-tells-us-about-the-2026-midterm-elections/">likely to lose at least one house of Congress</a> in the midterms — which could significantly limit his ability to silence other prominent voices. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s approach also depends on a tactic that political scientists call “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/asian-journal-of-comparative-law/article/when-the-first-brick-falls-of-the-fortress-of-democracy-dealing-with-the-first-slice-of-the-salami-tactic-for-eroding-democracy/624544D27E8D494E449062C2BE4A66AF">salami slicing</a>”: cutting off one little bit of democracy at a time by targeting one specific person or group, thus avoiding a sense that the collective needs to stand up for shared rights. That’s why we’ve seen not an attempt to criminalize dissent per se, but a series of discrete individual efforts like the Kimmel threats and the New York Times lawsuit.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Defiance, <em>collective</em> defiance, can make a big difference. The more that people across sectors take public and coordinated action —&nbsp;Congress, the media, the business world, even ordinary civil society — the more they can puncture Trump’s sense of inevitability, by fighting against and delaying his power grabs until 2027, when Democrats could hold real power to stop and hold him accountable for them.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This means, specifically, that we need more senators <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3lz354ik44c26">talking about democracy the way Chris Murphy does</a>. It means more business organizations <a href="https://apnews.com/article/costco-shareholder-proposal-diversity-dei-0330f448741b35f2f788a36948ff3f95">refusing to implement Trump’s directives</a> and working with <a href="https://www.leadershipnowproject.org/">pro-democracy organizations like Leadership Now</a> to demand nonpartisan regulatory policy. It means donors making a show of putting more money, not less, toward anti-Trump causes in general and toward the legal funds of targeted institutions in particular. It means media refusing to cow to Trump, and providing relentless coverage of situations like Kimmel’s.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And it means individual citizens attending protests and volunteering with the organizations under threat, as well as with political campaigns that could change things in 2026.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We are where Hungarians were in 2010, where Russians were in 2000, and where Germans were in 1933. Those places’ futures were not inevitable; had elites and even ordinary people made different choices, catastrophes could have been avoided.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ours still can be too.</p>

The Trump administration is openly coercing media organizations into suppressing speech that it does not like.&#160; On Monday night, late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel (irresponsibly) seemed to suggest that Charlie Kirk’s killer had conservative sympathies, before making several unrelated jokes at Donald Trump’s expense.  Two days later, FCC chair Brendan Carr warned broadcasters that if they [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar">openly coercing</a> media organizations into suppressing speech that it does not like.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday night, late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o">irresponsibly</a>) seemed to suggest that Charlie Kirk’s killer had conservative sympathies, before making several unrelated jokes at Donald Trump’s expense. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Two days later, FCC chair Brendan Carr <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1968392506711613526">warned broadcasters</a> that if they continued to disseminate Kimmel’s program, the government might fine them or revoke their licenses. Within hours, ABC had indefinitely suspended Kimmel.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This has posed a dilemma to many conservative commentators. On the one hand, right-wing pundits spent much of the past decade decrying the left’s censoriousness and insisting on the vital importance of free speech. On the other hand, they tend to think that Jimmy Kimmel is bad and that Donald Trump is good.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To their credit, some conservatives have registered <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/jawboning-and-jimmy-kimmel-free-speech-censorship">their objections</a> to Trump’s embrace of state sanctions on speech. But others have chosen to rationalize the administration’s behavior.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As they tell it, the Biden administration perpetrated <a href="https://x.com/Heminator/status/1968663796756480116">more severe and illegitimate</a> attacks on the First Amendment than Trump ever has. Liberal <a href="https://x.com/politicalmath/status/1968503233627746368">complaints</a> about Kimmel’s suspension are therefore <a href="https://x.com/Breaking911/status/1968460247653040148">hypocritical</a> and hyperbolic.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It is worth noting that this claim would not justify the Trump administration’s behavior, even if it were true. An attack on free speech does not need to be historically severe or unprecedented to be worthy of condemnation.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In any case, the right’s apologia for Trump’s FCC isn’t merely irrelevant but false. The president has now trammeled free speech rights far more blatantly and profoundly than his predecessor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why the right believes that liberals are getting a taste of their own medicine</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Right-wing defenses of the Trump FCC tend to center on one fundamental grievance: During the COVID pandemic, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/biden-administration-circumvents-first-amendment-bullying-private-actors#:~:text=vaccine%20misinformation,run%20around%20the%20First%20Amendment">pressured</a> social media companies to deplatform conservative critiques of public health policy. Republicans believe that this was a violation of the First Amendment. And they therefore see hypocrisy in liberal protestations against Kimmel’s suspension: If the left truly opposed government suppression of speech, it would have stood up for anti-vaxxers in 2021. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, in the view of <a href="https://x.com/Heminator/status/1968663796756480116">right-wing writer Mark Hemingway</a>, Biden’s actions were much more lawless than Trump’s: The FCC has the &#8220;legitimate regulatory authority” to punish broadcasters who spread misinformation, in the manner that Kimmel did. By contrast, the Biden administration “had ZERO authority over social media and still pressured them to censor information they found inconvenient.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To appreciate the problems with these arguments, one needs to understand what the Biden administration did and did not do, in its efforts to influence social media firms’ content moderation policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid the COVID crisis in 2021, the Biden administration sought to deter the spread of misinformation about the pandemic in general and vaccines in particular. In pursuit of this goal, it subjected social media companies to public criticism and private lobbying. At one point, President Biden accused Facebook of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/us/politics/biden-facebook-social-media-covid.html">killing people</a>” by disseminating vaccine misinformation, while the White House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/16/psaki-vaccine-misinformation-499850">flagged harmful posts</a> for the company, and requested their removal or algorithmic suppression.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This conduct raised legitimate civil libertarian concerns. Technically, the Biden administration was merely offering its opinion on what social media companies should do, not dictating their policies. As White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/16/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-july-16-2021/#:~:text=Obviously%2C%20those%20are%20steps%20they,more%20that%20can%20be%20taken">said</a> of Facebook in July 2021, “They’re a private-sector company. They’re going to make decisions about additional steps they can take.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the federal government has considerable power to affect social media firms’ businesses. Companies could therefore have reasonably believed that failing to comply with Biden’s content moderation requests would have invited greater regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Trump’s attack on free speech has no precedent</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, the Trump FCC’s conduct constitutes a graver assault on the First Amendment than the Biden administration’s jawboning of social media firms, for two primary reasons.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, Trump and Carr have <em>explicitly</em> threatened to take punitive regulatory actions against companies that air speech that they do not like. On Wednesday, Carr warned that ABC affiliates that continued to carry Kimmel’s program would risk <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1968392506711613526">suffering fines and license revocations</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In saying this, Carr was echoing threats that Trump had already leveled. Last month, long before Kirk’s killing and Kimmel’s scandal, the president <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-again-pushes-us-agency-revoke-nbc-abc-station-licenses-2025-08-25/">declared</a> that he was “totally in favor” of revoking the broadcast licenses of ABC and NBC because “they are so biased and untruthful.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, the Biden administration’s lobbying of Facebook was not aimed at stifling dissent against the government, but rather, furthering public health. Vaccine misinformation presented a genuine threat to Americans’ well-being. Although the COVID vaccines ultimately provided less protection from infection than hoped, they did substantially reduce individuals’ risk of dying from the virus. Following their release, COVID death rates in Democratic and Republican areas of the country <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/data-download/uneven-toll-coronavirus-pandemic-rcna97107">sharply diverged,</a> due to conservatives’ greater reluctance to get vaccinated. Some research indicates that universal vaccination could have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/05/13/1098071284/this-is-how-many-lives-could-have-been-saved-with-covid-vaccinations-in-each-sta">prevented</a> more than 300,000 COVID deaths.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t necessarily mean that the Biden administration’s behavior was justified. But it does suggest that its efforts were aimed at advancing a genuine public interest, not at undermining its political opposition.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump FCC, by contrast, has been targeting speech critical of the administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It is true that Carr’s ostensible complaint with Kimmel was that the host spread misinformation about Kirk’s assassination. But we know that this administration does not harbor a principled objection to unfounded speculation about Kirk’s death — because it has <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461254/charlie-kirk-shooting-trump-radical-left-violence">relentlessly engaged in such speculation itself</a>, suggesting repeatedly (and baselessly) that progressive organizations were implicated in the activist’s killing. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In reality, the administration almost certainly jumped on Kimmel’s indiscretion because the host is a critic of their regime. We can discern as much from context: When the president threatened to revoke ABC’s license in August, he did so on the grounds that the network had been running “97% BAD STORIES” about him, despite his “very high popularity.” Thus, it is this administration’s <em>explicit</em> position that broadcasters who cover it too critically should be barred from the airwaves.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Crucially, Trump’s FCC has not merely threatened to subject adversarial outlets to heightened regulatory scrutiny but actually done so. Upon taking office, Carr <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/news-distortion-the-new-fake-news/">launched</a> an investigation into ABC for fact-checking Trump during a 2024 presidential debate and another against CBS for its editing of an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. These probes were both inspired by tendentious allegations of political bias — complaints that the FCC would lack legal authority to redress, even if they could be proved. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, by signaling its willingness to use regulatory discretion for partisan ends, the FCC succeeded in compelling America’s most-watched broadcast network into adopting more favorable editorial practices. Earlier this year, CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, was seeking to merge with Skydance Media, a transaction that required FCC approval. To secure the administration’s blessing, Paramount <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-again-pushes-us-agency-revoke-nbc-abc-station-licenses-2025-08-25/">pledged to ensure</a> that CBS’s news and entertainment programming would be free of bias. The company also committed to hiring an ombudsman who would review any complaints about its content’s political slant. The FCC’s sole Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, decried these concessions as “never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.&#8221;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This precedent may have contributed to Kimmel’s suspension. Shortly after Carr aired his threats against ABC affiliates, Nexstar — America’s largest owner of local TV stations — <a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">announced</a> that its channels would not carry Kimmel’s show. Nextar is currently seeking to buy one of its rivals for $6.2 billion, a deal that will require FCC approval.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The FCC does not have the authority to punish Kimmel’s speculation about Charlie Kirk’s assassin</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, contrary to Hemingway’s suggestion, it is not true that the FCC has the regulatory authority to punish broadcasters for airing speech like Kimmel’s.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Commission <em>does</em> have the power to punish “<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/guides/hoaxes">broadcast hoaxes</a>.” But these are defined as instances in which a broadcaster disseminates information that 1) it knows to be false and 2) foreseeably causes “direct” and immediate “public harm” — in the sense of “actual damage to property or to the health or safety of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement or other public health and safety authorities from their duties.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel’s remarks do not remotely fit this description. In his controversial aside, the comedian said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Interpreted literally, Kimmel’s line is not even indisputably false. Kimmel technically did not assert that Kirk’s suspected killer was a conservative, only that the “MAGA gang” was desperate to counter that impression. Regardless, there is no evidence that Kimmel knew what he said to be untrue, nor that any immediate public harm resulted from his misleading comment.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Hypocrisy is not a justification for tyranny</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservatives are not wrong to find <em>some</em> progressives’ advocacy for free speech hypocritical or opportunistic. Segments of the left really did embrace <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/opinion/sunday/harpers-letter-free-speech.html">illiberal attitudes</a> toward free expression in recent years and fought to punish the expression of <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24156540/israel-palestine-protests-columbia-universities-free-speech">legitimate (or even popular)</a> points of view on college campuses and in the media. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden administration’s efforts to counter COVID misinformation, meanwhile, arguably undermined First Amendment rights. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet a White House <em>explicitly</em> threatening to shut down adversarial broadcasts constitutes a greater assault on political liberty than anything that progressive activists or Joe Biden ever did. Left-wing hypocrisy does not justify right-wing tyranny. Those who suggest otherwise are confessing their contempt for constitutional rule.</p>

A United Nations commission published a 72-page report on Tuesday that concluded Israel has committed a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.  “It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the Genocide Convention,” said Navi Pillay, chair of the commission.

<p class="has-text-align-none">A United Nations commission published a <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session60/advance-version/a-hrc-60-crp-3.pdf">72-page report</a> on Tuesday that concluded Israel has committed a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the Genocide Convention,” <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds">said Navi Pillay</a>, chair of the commission. The commission’s findings specifically determined that Israel has perpetrated at least four of the five acts of genocide as defined by the 1948 Geneva Convention. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The report adds yet another voice to the growing consensus that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide. Leading <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/">international</a>, <a href="https://www.alhaq.org/publications/25781.html">Palestinian</a>, and <a href="https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20250728_our_genocide">Israeli</a> human rights organizations have already released reports saying so. More recently, the International Association of Genocide Scholars <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/01/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-worlds-top-scholars-on-the-say">passed a resolution</a> that stated the same conclusion. They have been joined by <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/who-says-israel-committing-genocide-gaza-list-politicians-countries">at least 20</a> members of Congress who have called the war in Gaza a genocide.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The two latest members of Congress to make that statement did so after the UN commission’s report was released. “The intent is clear. The conclusion is inescapable: Israel is committing genocide in Gaza,” Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/op-eds/it-is-genocide/">wrote</a> in an op-ed on Wednesday. In another op-ed, Rep. Becca Balint, a Democrat from Vermont, echoed the sentiment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Today, I believe the Israeli government is committing a genocide against the Palestinian people,” <a href="https://couriernewsroom.com/news/rep-becca-balint-i-believe-israel-is-committing-a-genocide-in-gaza/">Balint wrote</a>. “As the granddaughter of a man murdered in the Holocaust, it is not easy for me to say that. But the trauma of the Holocaust serves as a reminder of the power of speaking out.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This growing consensus comes as Israel faces more and more pressure from the international community to stop the war, especially since the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) — the world’s leading authority on hunger crises — determined that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/422622/israel-famine-gaza-history-weaponizing-starvation-war">Israeli policy has created</a> a famine in Gaza. But Israel has ignored those calls and has instead <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/15/israel-gaza-city-occupation-ground-offensive">recently launched</a> a ground offensive to invade and occupy Gaza City.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the UN commission’s report says</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The commission — officially called the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel — was created in 2021 by the UN Human Rights Council. And since the start of the war in Gaza, it has been investigating violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Geneva Convention <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition">lays out five acts</a> that constitute genocide if any of them are undertaken with the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The newly released report concludes that Israel is responsible for four of the five: “(i) killing members of the group; (ii) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (iii) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; and (iv) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,” specifically by destroying health care infrastructure, including maternity wards and a fertility clinic. The report said there’s no evidence of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition#:~:text=A%20physical%20element%2C%20which%20includes,in%20whole%20or%20in%20part">fifth act of genocide</a>, which is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The report outlines various statements from Israeli officials to underscore intent. “Several statements by Israeli officials advocated for collective punishment against the Palestinian people as a whole or the population of Gaza in particular,” the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session60/advance-version/a-hrc-60-crp-3.pdf">report said</a>. “Some statements recognised that there was a difference between civilians and combatants but urged that all Gazans should be punished for the actions of the militants on 7 October 2023.”</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, invoked <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/facing-amalek">violent biblical references</a> in a letter to Israeli soldiers. “Remember what Amalek did to you,” the prime minister wrote. “This is a war between the sons of light and the sons of darkness.” In the Book of Samuel, God tells the Israelites to “go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.”&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, implied that all Palestinians in Gaza should be held accountable for Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel: “It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It is not true, this rhetoric about civilians who were not aware and not involved. It is absolutely not true.” </li>
<li>Yoav Gallant, then the Israeli defense minister, further dehumanized Palestinians, stating that Israel was fighting “human animals” and must “act accordingly.” Gallant also said, “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. There will be no Hamas. We will eliminate everything. If it doesn’t take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even months, we will reach all places.”</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But if these official statements leave room for doubt, the report doesn’t solely rely on them to infer intent but also focuses on Israel’s pattern of conduct. That includes Israel blocking humanitarian aid from entering Gaza and the forced starvation of Palestinians; targeting Gaza’s health care system; destroying the enclave’s educational, religious, and cultural facilities; perpetrating sexual and gender-based violence; and deliberately targeting children. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s one example: “Sexual violence [against Palestinians in Gaza] was used as a means of punishment and intimidation from the moment of arrest and throughout detention, including during interrogations and searches,” the report stated. “Several male detainees reported that Israeli security forces personnel had beaten, kicked, pulled or squeezed their genitals, often while the detainees were naked. One detainee stated that he had been forced to strip and ordered to kiss the Israeli flag. When he refused, he had been beaten, and his genitals had been kicked so severely that he had vomited and lost consciousness.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The report also said that the commission received credible information concerning “many cases of rape” and added that Israeli forces “sexually harassed and publicly shamed” Palestinian women.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The commission also documented how the mass killing of civilians — the death toll in Gaza has now reached <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-wars-09-17-2025-902e4a41eb3c5802fd18c598083d247a">more than 65,000 people</a> — has often been deliberate. “The Commission found that the Israeli security forces had clear knowledge of the presence of Palestinian civilians along the evacuation routes and within the safe areas but nevertheless they shot at and killed civilians, some of whom (including children) were holding makeshift white flags,” the report said. “Some children, including toddlers, were shot in the head by snipers.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">These are just a few of the horrific details among the commission’s findings, which are worth <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session60/advance-version/a-hrc-60-crp-3.pdf">reading in full</a>. But Israel has denied the allegations made in the report, resorting to tired tactics of calling it “fake,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/09/16/gaza-genocide-un-israel/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">accusing</a> the report’s writers of being antisemitic, and even “serving as Hamas proxies.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What impact will this report have?</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That this report is coming from an independent commission established by the UN only lends further credence to the piling charges and expert determinations that Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even for some skeptics, that conclusion is becoming harder and harder to avoid. Last month, for example, the president of J Street, a liberal-leaning Zionist lobbying group, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/j-street-head-says-hes-now-convinced-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza/">said</a> that while he might not use the term “genocide” himself, he “cannot and will not argue any more against those using the term. I simply won’t defend the indefensible,” adding that he has “been persuaded rationally by legal and scholarly arguments that international courts will one day find that Israel has broken the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf">international genocide convention</a>.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The report was also published just before the UN General Assembly is set to convene next week, which will likely highlight Israel’s growing international isolation as world leaders gather to discuss the most pressing concerns around the globe. More and more Western states, for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/458013/recognizing-palestinian-state-uk-france-australia">have already pledged</a> to recognize Palestine as a state, and the report’s conclusions will only add more pressure for states to take action to stop the genocide, such as arms embargos, boycotts, and sanctions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the report only adds to a growing chorus of experts and observers who have concluded that Israel is committing the crime of crimes. On its own, though, that will not carry much weight without corresponding government measures. And if Israel’s allies — chiefly, the United States — continue to support its military campaign while imposing few, if any, conditions on aid, then there is no end to the horror in sight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The year is 1956. You’re a researcher working at International Business Machines, the world’s leading tabulating machine company, which has recently diversified into the brand-new field of electronic computers. You have been tasked with determining for what purposes, exactly, your customers are using IBM’s huge mainframes.</p>
<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sign up <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>
</div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer turns out to be pretty simple: computers are for the military, and for the military alone. In 1955, the year before, by far the biggest single revenue source for IBM’s computer division was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment">SAGE Project</a>, a Defense Department initiative tasking IBM with creating a computer system capable of providing early warnings across the United States should nuclear-armed Soviet bombers attack the country. That brought in $47 million in 1955, and other military projects brought in $35 million. Programmable computers sold to businesses, meanwhile, brought in a paltry $12 million.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You send a memo to your boss explaining that computers’ impact on society will primarily be in giving the US an edge on the Soviets in the Cold War. The impact on the private sector, by contrast, seems minor. You lean back in your chair, light a cigarette, and ponder the glorious future of the defense-industrial complex.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You would, of course, be totally wrong — not just in the far future but in the very immediate one. Here’s what revenue looked like from each of IBM’s computing divisions in 1952 through 1964, compiled by company veteran <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/2730/Building-IBMShaping-an-Industry-and-Its-Technology">Emerson Pugh in his book <em>Building IBM</em></a>:</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Emerson-W.-Pugh-Building-IBM_-Shaping-an-Industry-and-Its-Technology-1995-The-MIT-Press.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Appendix D in a history of IBM, showing company revenues from different forms of computing" title="Appendix D in a history of IBM, showing company revenues from different forms of computing" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Emerson Pugh, &lt;em&gt;Building IBM&lt;/em&gt;." />
<p class="has-text-align-none">A mere two years after 1956, programmable computers sold to private companies had matched SAGE as a revenue source. The year after that, the private sector was bringing in as much as the military as a whole. By 1963, not even a decade after the 1955 data you were looking at, the military appears to be a rounding error next to IBM’s ballooning private computer revenues, which have grown to account for a majority of the company’s entire US revenue.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whoops!</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can we learn from how people are using AI right now?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, impressive teams of economists at both <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34255">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report">Anthropic</a> released big, carefully designed reports on how people are using their AI models —&nbsp;and one of my first thoughts was, “I wonder what an IBM report on how people used their first computers would’ve looked like.” (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent. Also, Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic; they don’t have any editorial input into our content.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear: the level of care the AI firms’ teams put into their work is many, many orders of magnitude greater than that shown by our fictional IBM analyst. Revenue isn’t the best measure of actual customer interest and use; everyone knew even in 1955 that computers were improving rapidly and their uses would change; the AI firms have access to an impressive array of real-time data on how their products are used that would have made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson">Watson</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson_Jr.">family</a> running IBM salivate.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, I think the IBM example is useful for clarifying what, exactly, we want to get out of this kind of data.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The AI firms’ reports are most useful at giving us a point-in-time snapshot, and a recent history over a couple of years, of what kind of queries are being sent to ChatGPT and Claude. You might have <a href="https://link.vox.com/view/6827a6294cfe5416df0e96f5orh4x.1iso/b6d0fe12">read my colleague Shayna Korol</a> in Wednesday’s Future Perfect newsletter laying out the OpenAI findings, and I also recommend the study coauthor and Harvard professor <a href="https://forklightning.substack.com/p/how-people-use-chatgpt">David Deming’s summary</a> <a href="https://forklightning.substack.com/p/chatgpt-really-does-offer-mundane">posts</a>. But some big picture, non-trivial things I’ve learned from the two reports are:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Uptake is skyrocketing: ChatGPT has gone from 1 million registered users in December 2022, to 100 million people using it at least weekly by November 2023, to over 750 million weekly active users now. If the number of messages sent to it keeps growing at the current pace, there will be more ChatGPT queries than Google searches by the end of next year.</li>
<li>Both OpenAI and Anthropic find that richer countries are using AI more than poor ones (no surprise there), but OpenAI intriguingly finds that middle-income countries like Brazil use ChatGPT nearly as much as rich ones like the US.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://forklightning.substack.com/p/chatgpt-really-does-offer-mundane">biggest use cases for ChatGPT</a> were &#8220;practical advice&#8221; like how-tos or tutoring/teaching (28.3% of queries), editing or translating or otherwise generating text (28.1%), and search engine-style information queries (21.3%). Anthropic uses different descriptive categories but finds that people using Claude.ai, the ChatGPT-like interface for its models, most commonly use it for computing and math problems (36.9% of usage), while an increasing share use it for &#8220;educational instruction and library&#8221; work (12.7%).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What <em>can’t</em> we learn?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But I’m greedy. I don’t just want to know the first-order descriptive facts about how these models are used, even though those are the kinds of questions these papers, and the internal data that OpenAI and Anthropic collect more generally, can answer. The questions I really want answered about AI usage, and its economic ramifications, are more like:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Will <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23787024/power-progress-book-ai-history-future-economy-daron-acemoglu-simon-johnson">human and AI labor be complements or substitutes</a> for each other in five years? Ten years? Twenty?</li>
<li>Will <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-great-inflection-a-debate-about-ai-and-explosive-growth">wages go up because the economy is still bottlenecked</a> on things only humans can do? Or will they collapse to zero because those bottlenecks don’t exist?</li>
<li>Will AI enable the creation of <a href="https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace">“geniuses in data centers”</a> — AI agents doing their own scientific research? Will this lead the stock of scientific knowledge about the world to grow faster than ever before? Will that lead to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24108787/ai-economic-growth-explosive-automation">explosive economic growth</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many people are asking these questions, and an impressive amount of theoretical work has been done in economics already on them. I’ve found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hS-Pu0gq22IwB9mWeig8Ui9kvUITgHj9eH3ik2zNVpo/edit?tab=t.0">this set of lecture slides and paper citations on the subjects from the economist Philip Trammell</a> very useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But that theoretical work is mostly in the form of, “what are some concepts that we could use to make sense of what is happening or will shortly happen?” —&nbsp;it’s theory, that’s the point! —&nbsp;and thus leaves a greedy, impatient man like myself without good answers, or even particularly good guesses, at the above questions. It’s a place where I want good empirical research to give me a sense of which theoretical frameworks are corresponding to ground reality.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">My fear is that, for reasons the IBM parable explains, empirical details about how AI is being used now can mislead us about how it will be used in the future, and about its most important effects on our lives. If you cryogenically froze our IBM analyst in 1956 and resurrected them today to analyze the OpenAI and Anthropic reports, what would they say about the more speculative questions above?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">They might point to the fact that the ChatGPT study found about half of all messages correspond to a pretty small number of &#8220;work activities,&#8221; as tracked by the Department of Labor, like &#8220;documenting/recording information&#8221; and &#8220;making decisions and solving problems.&#8221; Those are big categories for sure, but people have to do a lot else in their work that doesn&#8217;t fall under them. Our IBM analyst might conclude that AI is only automating a pretty small share of work tasks, meaning that human and AI labor will complement each other going forward.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then again, the analyst could look at the Anthropic report which found that &#8220;automation&#8221; use cases (where you just tell Claude to do something and it does the whole task, perhaps with periodic human feedback) are vastly more common among businesses using Anthropic&#8217;s backend to program their own specific Claude-enabled routines than &#8220;augmentation&#8221; use cases (where you ask Claude for feedback or for learning, etc., and work in concert with it). Augmentation still makes up a bigger share of usage on the <a href="http://claude.ai/">Claude.ai</a> website, but the automation share is growing there too. Our analyst might look at this and conclude that AI and human labor will wind up as substitutes, as Claude users are using it less as a sidekick than as an agent doing work on its own.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">All of these conclusions would be, I think, premature to the point of recklessness. This is why, to their credit, the authors of both the OpenAI and Anthropic reports are very careful about what they do and don’t know and can and cannot infer from their work. They’re not claiming these findings can tell us about the medium or long-run effects of AI on labor demand, or the distribution of economic growth, or the professions that will be most affected by AI — even though that’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/16/anthropic-economic-index-report-automation-entry-level-jobs-gen-z/">precisely what a lot of outside observers are doing</a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why AI is different from corn (I promise this makes sense)</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So let me finish by focusing on something the reports do tell us that is, I think, crucially important. One of the oldest findings in the economics of innovation is that new technologies take time, often a long time, to “diffuse” through the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The classic paper here is <a href="https://iaes.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/pdf/77.pdf">Zvi Griliches in 1957 on the spread of hybrid corn</a>. Hybrid corn was not one specific product, but a particular approach to breeding corn seeds optimally for specific soil in specific areas. Once a few farmers in a state adopted hybrid corn, subsequent uptake seemed to be unbelievably fast. Look at those S-curves!</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/griliches_corn.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A chart showing the adoption of “hybrid corn” techniques from 1932 to 1956 in Iowa, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Texas, and Alabama. They adopted the technology in that order, and it penetrated deeper into agriculture in Iowa than in later states like Texas." title="A chart showing the adoption of “hybrid corn” techniques from 1932 to 1956 in Iowa, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Texas, and Alabama. They adopted the technology in that order, and it penetrated deeper into agriculture in Iowa than in later states like Texas." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Zvi Griliches, “Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technological Change&quot;" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But while diffusion within individual states was fast, diffusion between states wasn’t. Why did Texas need a decade after the rise of hybrid corn in Iowa to realize that this could greatly increase yields? Why did it seem to hit a much lower ceiling of 60-80% usage, compared to universal uptake in Iowa? You also see these kinds of lags when looking at cases like <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2006600">electricity</a> and in <a href="https://dcomin.host.dartmouth.edu/files/exploration_technology.pdf">datasets covering a wide array of inventions</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Something the Anthropic and OpenAI data tells us pretty clearly is that the diffusion lags for AI are, by historical standards, very short. Adoption of this tech has been rapid, indeed faster than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">earlier online products</a> like Facebook or TikTok, let alone hybrid corn.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Past general-purpose technologies like electricity or computing took years or decades to diffuse through the economy, which limited their benefit for a time but also gave us time to adapt. We will likely not get that time this go-around.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Welcome to The Logoff:</strong> The Trump administration is leaning into its attack on free speech after pressuring ABC to take late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What happened?</strong> Kimmel was suspended by ABC on Wednesday after comments from President Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a podcast appearance Wednesday, Carr said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Subsequently, two major broadcast groups announced their intent to pull Kimmel’s show from local stations; Nexstar, one of those groups, needs FCC approval for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/business/media/nexstar-tegna-deal.html">pending merger</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What did Kimmel say?</strong> Ostensibly, Kimmel’s suspension was over arguably misleading but relatively anodyne <a href="https://x.com/jason_kint/status/1968456521353756883">remarks</a> he made about the death of Charlie Kirk earlier this week. On Thursday, however, Trump gave away the game, <a href="https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1968739210376134781">telling reporters</a> that, “When you have a network and you have evening shows and all they do is hit Trump…They’re not allowed to do that.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> Under the First Amendment, the government cannot suppress speech, no matter how much it might disagree with it. Kimmel’s suspension didn’t require any concrete action by the FCC, but it clearly came in response to Carr’s comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr also said Thursday that “I don’t think this is the last shoe to drop…the consequences are going to continue to flow.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the big picture?</strong> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjhoMGxra29nNmkiLCJwIjoiL3BvbGl0aWNzLzQ2MTg4Ny9qaW1teS1raW1tZWwtc3VzcGVuc2lvbi1haXItYWJjLWNoYXJsaWUta2lyay1uZXhzdGFyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5MzczNTQzLCJpYXQiOjE3NTgxNjM5NDN9.YM3GMYWJWySd9trlimPmYwiNoO-8KQ_Sth7eMJ9pICM&amp;utm_medium=gift-link&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_campaign=SSSCOTUSTrumpsTeam&amp;ueid=10b3a670165430d31fdd98f5af631883&amp;utm_term=Highly%20engaged%20non-contribs">As my colleague Zack Beauchamp has written</a>, this is Trump’s most brazen attack on free speech yet, and right out of a familiar autocratic playbook. Trump has a long way to go before he achieves a level of media control like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán — but the speed with which he was able to get Kimmel suspended is a concerning sign. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the fatal shooting of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461408/charlie-kirk-shooting-killed-right-way-suspect">conservative influencer Charlie Kirk</a> last week, observers rushed to take part in what’s become one of America’s most gruesome past times: waiting to figure out the politics of the shooter, so blame could be assigned to one party or the other for the tragedy.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservative politicians hurried to identify the shooter as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5499567-reporter-mace-democrats-kirk-killing/">a far-left Democrat</a>. After Tyler Robinson was arrested for the shooting, left-wing commenters circulated unfounded theories that Robinson might be a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/15/groyper-charlie-kirk-nick-fuentes-tyler-robinson">Groyper</a>, a white supremacist who thought Kirk’s racism didn’t go far enough. The war over Robinson&#8217;s identity reached a crescendo with <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/461948/jimmy-kimmel-pulled-trump-fcc-charlie-kirk">Jimmy Kimmel&#8217;s suspension</a>, after the late-night host seemed to imply Robinson was a MAGA supporter in a monologue Monday night. Meanwhile, the right, starting with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, has sought to spin Kirk’s killing into a larger narrative about the left’s propensity for political violence, a claim that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461314/charlie-kirk-death-trump-political-violence-source">isn’t backed by evidence</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, as Arie Perliger, a professor of criminology at UMass Lowell who has studied hundreds of political assassinations from the past century, has found, political violence is a much more complicated phenomenon than the current discourse would have us believe. “Each side picks the details that fit their own narratives, right?” he told Vox in a video interview.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And a closer look at assassinations reveals that the reasons for them run the gamut. For every assassin <a href="https://scout.lib.utk.edu/repositories/2/resources/1860">guided by a clearly comprehensive ideology of hatred and bigotry</a>, there’s one who thinks <a href="https://lblandmark.org/who-were-the-assassins-john-hinckley-jr-and-samuel-byck/">assassinating a US president will help him impress an actor</a> (Ronald Reagan and Jodie Foster, respectively). Thomas Matthew Crook, who shot at Donald Trump during a campaign event last summer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/us/thomas-crooks-trump-shooter-butler-rally.html">was a registered Republican who also donated to Joe Biden’s campaign</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Perliger thinks that when we endlessly obsess over the individual politics of an assassin, we’re focusing on the wrong question.&nbsp; “I think that we can learn much more about the overall conditions that facilitate people like Tyler Robinson,” he said. Those conditions, per Perliger’s research, include political polarization and endemic dysfunction —&nbsp;two qualities the US government has in spades right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can read highlights from my conversation with Perliger below. They’ve been lightly edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Give me a quick overview of some of the research you&#8217;ve done on assassins.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ten years ago, when I was faculty at West Point, we compiled a data set of around 700 political assassinations — not just of elected officials, but also judges and some other political figures.&nbsp; We tried to really understand if we could identify some patterns, some similarities, and if you could produce some kind of insights about the factors that can facilitate political assassinations.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Political assassination is perceived as a very quick shock to the system. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What we were able to find out is that political assassinations are a combination of two factors. First of all, there’s increasing political polarization and the overlap of different societal cleavages. The second thing is that in many cases, it is being utilized when groups, constituencies, individuals, movements are losing trust in the political system. In other words, they deem the political system as ineffective.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ordinarily, when we want to promote political changes, it demands a lot of resources, time, money, mobilizing the masses, and so on. Political assassination is perceived as a very quick shock to the system that can really dramatically change the political landscape and as a result can help the assassin to promote their objectives, their agenda.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>One of the things that is really striking is how frequently, for a lot of these very famous assassinations, the agenda at hand is hard to understand from the outside. How common is it for assassins to act for political reasons that the rest of us have a lot of trouble parsing?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Our expectation to see someone in his 20s having some kind of a coherent ideological framework — it&#8217;s a bit unrealistic, even if they do extreme acts of violence or any kind of extreme act.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s very difficult to understand how attitudes, emotions, and perceptions intersect to lead a young person to perpetrate [a crime]. This is why I tend to focus more on how the environment leads those individuals or confused individuals, which are very common in that age, to engage in those kinds of acts of violence. I&#8217;m not just talking about political assassination. I&#8217;m talking in general about why we see young people much more comfortable in engaging in different acts of violence or extreme activities, including on campuses. I think that&#8217;s the real question that I&#8217;m trying to answer and to look at in my research.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do political assassins tend to be younger? Is age correlated with assassination in the data set?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not necessarily, actually. Our data set goes back to World War II, and it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that most political action until the early 2000s, most groups that challenged the government or challenged the social order, were very organized. They were actual institutionalized organizations. They actually met with each other. They actually distributed physical texts.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What happened in the last 20 years is that a lot of those movements and a lot of those ideas now are virtual ones, where part of the ethos is direct action: “If you&#8217;re really a believer, you should not expect any kind of organizational support. You should act.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We see that on the environmental side, for example. A lot of environmental groups encourage members to act independently to protest against environmental policy that they don&#8217;t like, and so on. We see that also in the extremities of the left and the right, the idea that, in this day and age, we need to engage in these kinds of little resistances. If you really believe in those goals, in those ideologies, if you are really committed to the cause, you should act based on your own resources, based on your own capabilities. That&#8217;s really the secret sauce that will enable the movement to be more effective and to move forward. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And this is why you see so many lone actors recently, including during assassinations, which is much different than what we&#8217;ve seen in the past.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>One of the things that I&#8217;m interested in is that whenever a tragedy like this occurs, there&#8217;s a rush from observers and politicians and people in the media to try to figure out what side of the political aisle the perpetrator was on, so we can all decide who to blame for what they did. From your perspective, what do you think leads to that impulse? And is there any use to it?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s really funny to see all this cherry-picking. Each side picks the details that fit their own narratives, right? “He talked with his parents about how much he hates Kirk, so he’s on the left. His parents are Republicans, so he actually grew up in a conservative family.” It&#8217;s completely unproductive, and it doesn&#8217;t really tell us anything. In general, I&#8217;m very reluctant to focus on specific individuals. I think that we can learn much more about the overall conditions that facilitate people like Tyler Robinson.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s really funny to see all this cherry-picking. Each side picks the details that fit their own narratives, right? </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that I really emphasize when I&#8217;m being asked about this is the fact that political polarization has created a dysfunctional political system. Politicians today have zero incentives to engage in bipartisan politics. Congress, for a long time, has not actually engaged in policy construction, and cannot really produce any kind of shared politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s this strong sense that the system is delegitimizing the democratic process, and it creates a vacuum where different groups can argue democracy doesn&#8217;t work. “It&#8217;s obvious democracy doesn&#8217;t work. We should engage in other means in order to promote our objectives, whether it&#8217;s engaging in mass disruption, whether it&#8217;s burning everything that we can burn or killing people.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second element is that the incentives to go to the extreme create an ongoing delegitimization and demonizations of political rivals. Every policy that the other side promotes is an existential threat, is a catastrophe coming.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When I was tracking far-right online spaces during the Biden administration, every day they were sure that their constitutional rights were being violated, that their civil liberties were under threat. They were sure that antifa was at the gates. Every policy that Biden promoted was perceived as, “Okay, that&#8217;s the end of America.” In many ways, we see that now.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Look, we can have policy debates, but not every policy is an existential threat to the republic. We need to be able to actually have a discussion that is more nuanced. No wonder that people think that we have to do something, because things are going really, really bad. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The combination of all those things that I&#8217;ve just mentioned has created an environment which normalizes the usage of political violence, normalizes a consistent challenging of the system and the status quo. It’s created a situation where everybody feels that we&#8217;re in a very dark place. That&#8217;s because the mechanism that&#8217;s supposed to overcome those dark places is not really functioning anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of my colleagues don&#8217;t like me saying that. I got tons of emails of all the interviews I did in the last few days: How dare I blame both sides? I blame both sides because I think both sides are engaged in similar rhetorical practices, and both sides are involved in violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It seems like you’re arguing that the political system has become so dysfunctional that a response of nihilism is, in some ways, quite rational. Is that a fair summary?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Definitely. In a different environment, people like Tyler Robinson would find more constructive ways to express their concerns. However, considering all the things that I&#8217;ve just mentioned to you, all those factors that work together, it&#8217;s no wonder that some of those individuals resort to those kinds of actions. It&#8217;s a broader theme that we see about how the entire societal discourse is normalizing these kinds of things. <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/390911/luigi-mangione-uhc-shooter-manifesto-reddit-blackpill">Luigi Mangione</a> became a folk hero in some circles.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s going back to the lack of even basic empathy as human beings, and the fact that ideology basically encompasses everything, that we stop seeing people. We&#8217;re seeing everyone through ideological lenses and ideological prisms. We&#8217;re losing the basic understanding that our discourse would be much better if you maintain some of those aspects of some of those sentiments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m always being asked what&#8217;s the one thing that our leaders can do. I always tell them that they don&#8217;t need to talk. They actually need to engage in bipartisan behavior that will signal to their constituencies that the other side is not necessarily evil. Once you signal to your constituency that it is possible to work with the other side, that&#8217;s a strong enough message to understand that it&#8217;s actually possible to create things together, and not just each side engaging in performative politics that maybe give them some votes from their bases, but doesn&#8217;t really promote anything really constructive.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is there anything we haven’t discussed about this assassination that you think is particularly of note?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s two things that I think are really interesting. First of all, the expansion of political assassinations outside the political system. Charlie Kirk was not an elected official. He was a public speaker, and you can argue he was probably more influential than many other elected officials. That created a different discourse among what we call the influencers on the right and the left. It&#8217;s not just that suddenly they are talking about their own sense of security, but it also shows that politics right now is probably much more combustible outside the institution. It created different dynamics of where politics is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second thing I think is it happened on a university campus. It&#8217;s another reflection of the fact that campuses are becoming spaces for very contentious acts and violent acts. Campuses are less and less becoming places where you can actually engage in intellectual debate and exchange of ideas. Most people on campus these days are reluctant to engage in any kind of political discourse or any kind of issues, because of the potential cost. So we are losing universities as spaces where there&#8217;s actual intellectual debate, and they are becoming more spaces where both sides are doing performative politics, just doing performance, rather than actually talking to each other.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">ABC pulled late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air “indefinitely” Wednesday night following pressure from the Federal Communications Commission over comments Kimmel made on the suspect apprehended for the killing of right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel’s suspension comes after a monologue Monday night in which he said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” Many read this as Kimmel implying that the shooter himself was right-wing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Late-night talk show monologues are supposed to be funny, not rigorous journalism. It’s very unusual for a comedian to be suspended because of one, and it’s clear that Kimmel would not have been suspended if President Donald Trump’s FCC had not put extraordinary pressure on Disney-ABC. (In this case, that pressure was applied via Nexstar Media, the largest owner of TV stations in the US, which announced it would preempt Kimmel’s show. <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/">Nexstar is currently awaiting FCC approval for a planned $6.2 billion acquisition</a>.) On Thursday morning, amid mounting outcry over Kimmel’s suspension, it was reported that ABC “<a href="https://x.com/dylanbyers/status/1968485878390550964?s=46">hopes to have the matter resolved and the show return</a>.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole controversy is a shocking turn both in the Trump administration’s escalating war on its critics and in Jimmy Kimmel’s once pointedly apolitical career. Kimmel, after all, has spent most of his career embodying one archetype: regular American straight white dude. What could be more harmless and less controversial than that?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel started his career as a comic and radio host, an approachable everyman. In his first major television role as a host of Comedy Central’s <em>Win Ben Stein’s Money</em> in 1997, he was the audience surrogate, with his schlubby persona and his blue-collar accent an easy balance to Stein’s erudite snobbery. When Kimmel became the co-host of <em>The Man Show</em> in 1999, he was continuing to play the same character, only with the boorishness dialed up: leering at hot girls and circulating petitions to end women’s suffrage. In the raunch-obsessed 2000s, the crassness played as edgy: not politically correct, certainly, but the kind of thing it was assumed any man would probably do, if he could only unleash his id. </p>
<div class="youtube-embed"><iframe title="What Jimmy Kimmel Thinks about Women&#039;s Suffrage" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0TgCgdvJ2c?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel left <em>The Man Show</em> in 2003 to launch <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> on ABC, where he dialed down the ogling but maintained his everyday dude persona. He also stayed away from talking too much politics. In those years when <em>The Daily Show</em> and <em>The Colbert Report</em> were at the height of their power and influence, Kimmel’s biggest running gag was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSfoF6MhgLA&amp;list=PL0DD371FFDFF2057A">mock feud with Matt Damon</a>. Regular guys, after all, are not policy wonks. They like making chill jokes about movie stars.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When the guy from <em>The Man Show</em> becomes Walter Cronkite</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel wouldn’t start to get political in earnest until 2017, when his son was born with a rare congenital heart defect. At the time, a Republican-controlled Congress was pushing to repeal the Affordable Care Act. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/television/jimmy-kimmel-baby-son-wife.html">Kimmel lashed out in a rare emotional monologue</a>. “Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you’d never be able to get health insurance because you had a preexisting condition,” Kimmel said, adding through tears. “If your baby is going to die, and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make.”</p>
<div class="youtube-embed"><iframe title="Jimmy Kimmel Reveals Details of His Son’s Birth &amp; Heart Disease" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmWWoMcGmo0?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Later that year, Kimmel was once again in tears over the news. There was a mass shooting in Las Vegas, Kimmel’s hometown. &#8220;It&#8217;s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,&#8221; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/10/03/555318165/watch-jimmy-kimmel-slams-so-called-leaders-on-gun-control">Kimmel said</a>. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why our so-called leaders continue to allow this to happen, or maybe a better question, why do we continue to let them to allow it to happen?&#8221;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">All of a sudden, marveled New York magazine, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-on-healthcare-trump-gun-control.html">Jimmy Kimmel was Walter Cronkite</a>. In an interview, Kimmel noted that his background made it “hit harder” when he talked about politics: “To hear the guy from <em>The Man Show</em>&nbsp;talk about [gay rights] in an inclusive way — I have some credibility,” he allowed. He felt his evolution showed that “the country has come a long way.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel, after all, was the avatar of regular American straight white guys. He was where the mainstream was. In <em>The Man Show</em> days, the implication was that you would have to be a humorless prude not to laugh at the joke if Kimmel was the guy making it. Now, if Kimmel was cool with gay rights and health care and gun control, the implication was that you would have to be a real heartless freak not to agree with him.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel’s liberal turn came with a fair amount of anti-Trump jokes, all of which infuriated Trump. In 2018, in a sign of things to come, Trump reportedly had his administration make repeated calls to executives at ABC parent company Disney, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-white-house-pressure-disney-censor-jimmy-kimmel-1234686853/">telling them to rein Kimmel in</a>. Much to Trump’s displeasure, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jimmy-kimmel-mouth-shut_n_65f7af20e4b030e8357a7d66">Kimmel, if anything, doubled down on his Trump material</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Jimmy Kimmel is — every night, he hits me, I guess. His ratings are terrible,” <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jimmy-kimmel-mouth-shut_n_65f7af20e4b030e8357a7d66">Trump told Fox News in 2024</a>. “He’s not a talented guy.” <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-named-trump-trial_n_6634747ae4b05f96b017e11a">During Trump’s 2024 criminal trial, Kimmel made an unexpected cameo</a>: Prosecutors entered into evidence text messages in which Trump’s lawyers fretted over Trump’s anger when Stormy Daniels appeared on Kimmel’s show. <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/420351/late-show-with-stephen-colbert-cancellation-political-comedy-trump">After CBS fired Stephen Colbert earlier this year</a>, Trump gloated that Kimmel would be next.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Trump has finally managed to accomplish what he wanted to do in 2018. He used government pressure to get Jimmy Kimmel off the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Kimmel’s suspension throws into relief how symbolic he’s become. His evolution from smug post-feminist crassness in the 2000s to a sincere and outraged liberalism during Trump’s first term mirrors the political evolution American pop culture underwent at the same time. Perhaps that’s why, despite how dramatically American culture has shifted since the days of <em>The Man Show</em>, and despite how envelope-pushing his early comedy looks now, Kimmel emerged from the so-called cancel culture moment relatively unscathed. He’s never faced serious career repercussions for people outraged in retrospect by the Juggy Dance Squad or Hot Girls Jumping on Trampolines. In 2020, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/24/882504182/late-night-talk-show-host-jimmy-kimmel-apologizes-for-use-of-blackface">he apologized for having worn blackface in old <em>Man Show</em> episodes</a>, and that was the end of that. People have been more or less willing to take him at his word when he says that his intentions were good and that his outlook has sincerely changed.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, the thing that got Jimmy Kimmel right up to the edge of losing his show is that he said something the president doesn’t like. Kimmel is acting as a mirror yet again, and this time, what he’s showing us is that we are lost in an illiberal moment.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01213-z">commentary paper</a> in the journal <em>Nature Food</em>, some of the worst animal suffering in the world can be prevented at a rate of just a couple of pennies per hour: the extreme pain experienced by chickens raised for meat. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last 75 years, chickens have been bred to grow incredibly large and incredibly fast. Their rapid growth rate has made chicken the most affordable and plentiful meat in the US, where <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">over 9 billion are raised and slaughtered annually</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s come at the cost of making chickens <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/408152/animal-cruelty-factory-farms-chicken-welfare-genetics">suffer terribly</a> throughout their short lives from a range of health and welfare issues, like <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9386003/">heat stress</a>, <a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/poultry/miscellaneous-conditions-of-poultry/ascites-syndrome-in-poultry">heart failure</a>, and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6749567/">lameness</a> — difficulty walking — which can be so severe that chickens die of dehydration or starvation because they can’t even stand and move to get water and food.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s arguably the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/408152/animal-cruelty-factory-farms-chicken-welfare-genetics">largest form of systematized animal cruelty</a> humans have ever invented.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the scale and cruelty of conventional chicken farming — and other forms of livestock production — animal welfare has largely been left out of food policy discussions. The nonprofit <a href="https://welfarefootprint.org/">Welfare Footprint Institute</a>, composed of a team of animal welfare researchers that led the <em>Nature Food </em>paper, is looking to change that by putting a cost on preventing animal pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The group looks at how animals are bred, the conditions in which they’re raised, and the prevalence and frequency of problems like injury and disease in those systems to determine how many hours of certain types of pain they experience. Scientific research on animal welfare — using behavioral observations, neurophysiological markers, and response to pain-relieving drugs — informs WFI’s work, and the group’s population-level estimates try to account for differences in individual animals’ experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to their research, the average factory-farmed chicken experiences:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>50 hours of “<a href="https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/pain-intensities/">disabling pain</a>” — pain so severe that it &#8220;significantly limits or prevents normal activities and functioning” — in their lifetime</li>
<li>334 hours of what the researchers call “hurtful pain,” or moderate pain that causes distress</li>
<li>325 hours of “annoying pain,” a mild but distracting discomfort</li>
<li>30 seconds of “excruciating pain,” an “overwhelming pain that dominates” their consciousness </li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s about 700 hours of pain. Considering that chickens raised for meat only live for around 1,100 hours, or 45 days, and sleep for a sizable portion of that, they experience some level of pain for much of their waking life. These painful hours represent a kind of “welfare footprint,” the authors argue.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As consumers, producers, policy-makers, investors and advocates, we are able to easily find out the prices of products, and we now also have carbon footprints to understand environmental impacts,” Kate Hartcher, a senior researcher with WFI and a co-author of the paper, told me over email. “So, why not have the same for animals?”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One simple change, Hartcher and her co-authors argue, can improve the welfare footprint of chicken meat for mere pennies: switching to slower-growing chicken breeds.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Raising chickens slow and fast</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For the last decade, animal welfare groups have campaigned for meat producers and major food brands to adopt what they call the Better Chicken Commitment, a <a href="https://betterchickencommitment.com/us/policy/">slate of reforms</a> including using slower-growing chicken breeds, which are known to have lower rates of lameness, heart and lung disease, heat stress, and other issues. It also calls for other changes, like giving chickens more space and using a more humane slaughter method.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the Welfare Footprint Institute, chickens raised according to these standards suffer about 33 fewer hours of disabling and excruciating pain compared to conventional fast-growing chickens. Poultry companies have resisted calls to switch to slower-growing chicken breeds because they cost more to raise, taking about two weeks longer to reach their lower slaughter weight. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/BvbUD-fast-growing-chickens-suffer-a-lot-more-than-slower-growing-chickens.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A chart showing how fast-growing chickens suffer more hours of pain than slower-growing chickens. " title="A chart showing how fast-growing chickens suffer more hours of pain than slower-growing chickens. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But, according to the Welfare Footprint Institute’s new paper, which was written in conjunction with researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the University of Colorado Boulder, the cost is minuscule in terms of how much it costs to prevent pain. Switching to slower-growing breeds, according to their analysis, would prevent at least 15 to 100 hours of disabling and excruciating pain at a rate of 45 cents per pound for producers. (And even that range is a very conservative estimate, Hartcher told me, because it doesn’t account for all of the many serious welfare problems on chicken factory farms.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Put in other words, an hour of these intense forms of pain could be averted at a rate of just half a cent to three cents.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, agricultural economists <a href="https://senciencia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a17ec-jare_slowgrowth_published.pdf">estimated</a> that slower-growing breeds raise production costs by 11 percent to 26 percent and increase wholesale chicken prices by 10 to 36 cents per pound. The switch could moderately raise the price of chicken for consumers but, Hartcher said, “instead of focusing on the ‘costs’ of improving animal welfare, we show that the cost of preventing pain is tiny, and the benefits are enormous.” </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A brutal trade-off</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Chicken Council, the industry’s leading trade group, however, has <a href="https://www.chickencheck.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/environmental-impact-slow-growth-chicken.pdf">argued against using slower-growing breeds</a> — not just on economic grounds, but also on environmental ones. To meet current chicken demand with smaller, slower-growing breeds, the NCC says, the US industry would need to raise a lot more birds — an additional 4.5 billion or so per year, an approximately 50 percent increase. That also means using more land, pesticides, and fertilizer to grow chicken feed, all of which contribute to climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00071668.2024.2432926#d1e1125">generally</a> <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210478">true</a>, even if the National Chicken Council is far from an authority on environmental sustainability (the poultry industry is a major <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/4/20993654/chicken-beef-climate-environment-factory-farms">air and water polluter</a>). The National Chicken Council didn’t respond to a request for comment on the <em>Nature Food</em> paper.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Exactly how much slower-growing breeds increase greenhouse gas emissions is unclear and can vary depending on the specific breed, feed sourcing, and farming practices. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579122004400?via%3Dihub">2022 study</a> found a 16 percent emissions increase, while a <a href="https://corporate.perduefarms.com/pdfs/animal_care_report.pdf">2022 trial</a> by poultry giant Perdue Farms found a 9 percent to 13.4 percent increase. According to a <a href="https://avec-poultry.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/European-Chicken-Commitment-Report-ADAS-March-2024.pdf">European chicken industry group</a>, using slower-growing breeds when paired with other welfare reforms increases the climate footprint of chicken meat by 24 percent.  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever the exact environmental difference, arguing against treating animals better because it would marginally raise climate emissions implies a disturbing position: That raising animals who’ve been bred to suffer terribly is permissible so long as it’s better for the climate. In surveys, consumers say they care <a href="https://climateaction.rutgers.edu/why-health-and-price-not-sustainability-drive-u-s-meat-consumption-choices/">similarly</a> or <a href="https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/84794301/Consumers_across_five_European_countries.pdf">even more</a> about animal welfare than sustainability.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">However, this logic has proven persuasive to influential policymakers, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/422708/future-of-food-abundance-factory-farming-grunwald">environmental researchers</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf">some environmental groups</a>. In 2023, when the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization published a <a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/61c1ab4e-32f7-47c4-b267-d6410bb1dac3/content">road map</a> on how the world can feed a growing population without blowing past climate targets, it wrote that the livestock sector “requires intensified productivity via improved genetics” — in other words, using breeds that make animals grow bigger and faster, and suffer more.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Hartcher said her and her coauthors’ analysis challenges the notion “that the intensification of animal production, including faster growth rates, can be justified by environmental considerations alone, given the disproportionate and severe animal welfare harms and only minimal variations in environmental indicators.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The switch to slower-growing chickens does, however, present a different dilemma for animal advocates: Is it better to farm fewer chickens who are all suffering a lot, or more chickens who are each suffering somewhat less?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, most animal advocates — and some environmentalists, too — try to square the tensions in these trade-offs by recommending that we eat less meat overall and treat each animal better, an approach sometimes called &#8220;<a href="https://www.tabledebates.org/research-library/what-less-better-meat">less but better</a>.&#8221;  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Almost in all of these cases, you&#8217;re never going to land on the optimal thing,” <a href="https://www.sei.org/people/cleo-verkuijl/">Cleo Verkuijl</a>, a senior scientist at the US branch of the Stockholm Environment Institute and a co-author of the <em>Nature Food</em> paper, told me. But now businesses and policymakers can at least account for animal suffering rather than ignore it, and make more reasoned — and hopefully, more humane — decisions.&nbsp;</p>

You might not consider yourself a creative person anymore, but you almost certainly were at one point. Among childhood’s many blessings is the freedom to play and create; art class, recess, and music lessons offer outlets for unbridled imagination and expressiveness. But somewhere along the way, play and creation become uncool, something only little kids [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might not consider yourself a creative person anymore, but you almost certainly were at one point. Among childhood’s many blessings is the freedom to play and create; art class, recess, and music lessons offer outlets for unbridled imagination and expressiveness. But somewhere along the way, play and creation become uncool, something only little kids do, according to <a href="https://casholman.com/">Cas Holman</a>, a toy designer and author of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/736596/playful-by-cas-holman-with-lydia-denworth/"><em>Playful: How Play Shifts Our Thinking, Inspires Connection, and Sparks Creativity</em></a>. So we stop. We focus on activities we excel in or could make us money instead of ones we enjoy simply for the sake of doing them.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As grown-up responsibilities mount, what limited free time remains might not be dedicated to creative pursuits but to rest, entertainment, doomscrolling. But for all the overwhelm in the world, you might have an itch for a more tactile, creative outlet — one that takes you away from the news, screens, and chaos, and puts you in touch with your more playful side.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not only are these activities enjoyable, but infusing more creativity into your free time might also make you more creative in other domains, too. The unstructured and exploratory thinking fostered by a hobby can bleed into other areas of your life, says <a href="https://www.zorana-ivcevic-pringle.com/">Zorana Ivcevic Pringle</a>, a senior research scientist at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-zorana-ivcevic-pringle/the-creativity-choice/9781541704329/"><em>The Creativity Choice: The Science of Making Decisions to Turn Ideas Into Action</em></a><em>.</em> Indulging in that creative curiosity at work, for instance, might breed breakthroughs there, too.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you think the creative part of you is long dormant, it’s possible to foster your more imaginative side. “That play instinct is still there,” Holman says. “We all became who we are through play, and we can still connect to that play from childhood. But also, there is a play inside of us that has evolved with us and will look and feel different than the play did when we were children.” If you’ve been wanting to start some sort of creative practice but have felt stymied, here are three simple tips to help you get started and sustain your new habits.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">1. Tap into your history and interests</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps the greatest threat to any new or reignited creative habit is waning motivation. At the onset of a new venture, <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-025-07733-3">motivation</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcal.12385">is high, but it</a> tapers over time. But doing something you genuinely like (or used to like) makes it <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976251350960">more likely you’ll stick with it.</a> “Whatever makes something more fun for you tends to make you more motivated to keep doing it,” says <a href="https://www.katymilkman.com/">Katy Milkman</a>, Wharton professor and author of <a href="https://www.katymilkman.com/book"><em>How to Change: The Science of Getting From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be</em></a>. “The broad thing we can say from research is, is it fun and alluring, and does it have a hook for you personally? That&#8217;s different for every person.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It can be helpful to remember how you used to play as a kid and try to replicate those feelings, if not the exact scenarios, in adulthood, Holman says. Maybe you sang in your school choir growing up. You don’t need to go as far as joining a local a cappella group, but you could make it a point to sing unabashedly in the shower, car, or at karaoke. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Pay attention to the feelings of joy or pleasure, Pringle says. By doing so, you can collect more evidence for why creativity and playfulness are worth prioritizing, giving you more of a reason to continue. For example, drawing has been shown to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-30383-001">reduce feelings of sadness and anger</a>. “You can notice, ‘This is doing something for me emotionally,’” Pringle says.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>You don’t need to go as far as joining a local a capella group, but you could make it a point to sing unabashedly in the shower, car, or at karaoke.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Gamifying the activity can make it more likely that you’ll stick with it, especially if this is an activity you enjoy, Milkman says. Whether that’s keeping up your streak on Duolingo, organizing a personal 30-day knitting challenge, or giving yourself a little treat every time you journal, anything that encourages continued behavior helps the habit stick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When life inevitably gets hectic and you feel short on time, remind yourself that you’re making space for this endeavor because it’s important to you. “Start with that sense of identity,” Pringle says. “We do those things that are important to who we are as a person. If you realize that, then you can start saying, ‘Well, how am I going to make the time?’ But the first step is being rooted in that sense of what is important to you as a human.”&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">2. Keep it low pressure</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Parents or people who work multiple jobs might not have the luxury of unscheduled hours to devote to extensive creative hobbies. But even the most strapped for time can imbue playfulness in the smaller moments. Notice the people around you on your commute or at the grocery store and try to imagine elaborate backstories for them. In the moments after you’ve finished dinner but before you start the dishes, pull out some scrap paper and doodle. “It doesn&#8217;t have to have that much pressure,” Holman says. “It&#8217;s not about the outcome. It&#8217;s about sitting for a moment and doodling and playing with the colors and trying to make some stripes.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you are resuming an old hobby from your past, don’t get hung up on technical proficiency, or lack thereof. It can feel demoralizing to pick up your guitar after many years and realize you’re rustier than you remembered. “It can undermine people&#8217;s confidence instead of building it,” Pringle says.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Confidence is crucial when maintaining creative hobbies, Pringle continues, and it comes from making progress, which only builds more confidence. So don’t try to talk yourself out of creating just because you’re struggling or your output is less than stellar. While you probably <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23979535/permission-to-suck-terrible-hobbies">will improve over time,</a> the true benefit comes from the act itself, not the outcome, Holman says. Ask yourself what success actually looks like. Do you need to bake a patisserie-worthy cake or can you throw a bunch of ingredients together and feel satisfied that you actually made something from scratch?&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3. Share your creations instead of monetizing them</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In today’s hustle culture, many are enticed to turn their hobbies into <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23640192/sebastian-ghiorghiu-youtube-hustle-gurus-passive-income-dropshipping">money-making ventures</a>. Aside from the obvious motivation — to earn more cash — the impulse to monetize hobbies comes from a desire to share your work, Holman says. Instead of opening an Etsy shop and slapping a price tag on your doodles, you could write a note on them and mail them to friends and family to satisfy that urge.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Leveraging hobbies as side hustles can actually hamstring creativity, Pringle says. Creating in order to turn a profit “puts the pressure of productivity on you,” Pringle says. When you’re only thinking about how to make more to sell more, you close yourself off to creative exploration: There’s no room for meandering when money is on the line. “We are not willing to do something just for the heck of it. We are not willing to do something although we don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going to lead,” Pringle says. “All of those things are absolutely necessary for creativity. If you know at every moment what you are doing, you are not doing creative work.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Leveraging hobbies as side hustles can actually hamstring creativity, Pringle says. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To invite creativity into your life, you need fewer constraints and rules — not more. Try to free yourself from what you believe you “should” be doing or the “right” way to play.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Play isn&#8217;t a thing to be good at. This isn&#8217;t another thing you have to master, another badge,” Holman says. “Play can be in everything you do, and actually will make you feel better about everything else, because you&#8217;ll be yourself in it.”</p>
