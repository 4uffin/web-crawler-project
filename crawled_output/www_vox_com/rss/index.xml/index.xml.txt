<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s be clear about what just happened: Jimmy Kimmel, a prominent late-night comedian, was just taken off the airwaves because the Trump administration didn’t like what he had to say —&nbsp;and threatened his employer until they shut him up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration, it appears, has learned to effectively weaponize the regulatory powers of the federal government to punish speech it doesn’t like from people it doesn’t like.&nbsp;This is a favored weapon of modern autocrats; its deployment against Kimmel is a qualitative escalation even above the administration’s previous acts of censorship (like targeting <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/406199/ice-rumeysa-ozturk-tufts-logoff">the author of a pro-Palestine op-ed</a> for deportation).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What just happened, in short, shows how far down the authoritarian road the United States has traveled in just eight months.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Jimmy Kimmel and the abuse of state powers</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel’s downfall began with some admittedly ill-advised speculation in Monday’s monologue: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the evidence suggested the shooter very likely was not a MAGA believer (and evidence released the next day showed that he almost certainly was on the political left).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Kimmel’s aside —&nbsp;in a <a href="https://x.com/latenightercom/status/1968455055251562716">monologue mostly focused on mocking President Donald Trump</a> —&nbsp;did not justify what came next. During a Wednesday podcast appearance, FCC head Brendan Carr threatened to <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1968392506711613526">revoke the broadcasting licenses of any stations</a> that continued to air Kimmel’s content.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s time for them to step and say this garbage…isn’t something that we think serves the needs of our local communities,” he said.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr’s threat should have been toothless. The FCC is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/fcc-and-speech">prohibited by law</a> from employing “the power of censorship” or interfering “with the right of free speech.” There is a very narrow and rarely used exception for “news distortion,” in which a broadcast news outlet knowingly airs false reports. What Kimmel did&nbsp;—&nbsp;an offhand comment based on weak evidence — is extremely different from creating a news report with the intent to deceive.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But months before the shooting, Carr had <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/news-distortion-the-new-fake-news/">begun investigating complaints under this exception</a> against ABC and CBS stations, specifically allegations of anti-conservative bias. Stations had to take Carr’s threat seriously — even though Carr himself had declared (in <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1841651190783684620">a 2024 tweet</a>) that “the First Amendment prohibits government officials from coercing private parties into suppressing protected speech.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hours after Carr’s Wednesday threat, Nexstar — the largest owner of local stations in America — suddenly decided that Kimmel’s comments from two nights ago were unacceptable. Nexstar, it should be noted, is currently attempting to purchase one of its major rivals for $6.2 billion — a merger that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/business/media/nexstar-tegna-deal.html">would require express FCC approval</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Mr. Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse,” Andrew Alford, the president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division, said in a statement. “Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Without access to Nexstar’s roughly 200 stations — covering about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/business/media/nexstar-tegna-deal.html">39 percent</a> of the national market, the maximally allowed cap — Kimmel would suffer an enormous ratings blow.&nbsp;And so, shortly after Nexstar’s announcement, ABC/Disney announced that he’d be suspended indefinitely.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has had it in for Jimmy Kimmel, a prominent critic, for a very long time. After CBS axed fellow late-night Trump critic Stephen Colbert earlier this year, the president repeatedly said that Kimmel was “<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114874422468516376" rel="nofollow">next</a>.” Kimmel’s Kirk comments, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/media/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-trump-fcc-brendan-carr">both an FCC commissioner</a> and (reportedly) <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jimmy-kimmel-out-abc-charlie-kirk-comments-1235430078/">ABC executives</a> considered well within bounds, seem like a pretext — taking advantage of the pervasive climate of fear and censorship in the wake of Kirk’s death to punish a prominent name on the president’s enemies list.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The weaponization of seemingly neutral “good government” rules, like broadcast regulation, to punish the enemies of the current president is a familiar turn in the story of democratic backsliding. It was one of the principal tools used by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to batter his country’s press into submission, ultimately forcing independent outlets to sell to government-aligned conglomerates who transformed their editorial stance.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It would take quite a bit more work for Trump to consolidate Orbán-levels of control over the media. But what’s so striking about the Kimmel case is how swiftly Nexstar (and ABC) rolled over. They didn’t even try to put up a fight to defend their own ability to control what goes on their airwaves. They instead apparently decided that fighting the government is costly and risky, putting licenses or even a valuable merger at risk, and that risking that isn’t worth it for Jimmy Kimmel.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is what it looks like when a society’s elite rolls over in the face of authoritarianism. It never ends well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This morning, ousted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Susan Monarez came to the Senate to share her story of being fired by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President Donald Trump, the latest volley in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and the public health establishment.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Monarez’s testimony, the upcoming meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — which will take place over the next two days — had been the impetus for her ouster. She testified that, during a contentious meeting with Kennedy before she was fired, he asked her to approve, sight unseen, the new vaccine recommendations that would be made by his new ACIP. The panel is now staffed by experts who were handpicked by Kennedy, who also asked her to fire career CDC vaccine scientists. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During her testimony before the Senate health committee, Monarez maintained composure as many Republican senators sought to cast doubt on her credibility. But the committee chair, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who is also a trained physician, was a counter-force: He issued his own warning about unjustified changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, particularly the hepatitis B shot.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And now, what could be the real breaking point for Kennedy’s Make America Healthy agenda is here.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At tomorrow’s and Friday’s meetings, the ACIP will discuss possible changes to the childhood vaccine schedule and the federal government’s guidance for the Covid-19 and hepatitis B vaccines and for measles-mumps-rubella shots. The guidance for hepatitis B shots, in particular, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-committee-meeting-infants.html">may be changed</a>, and emerged as a flashpoint at Wednesday’s hearing.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The rift over the hepatitis B vaccine, briefly explained</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">How did the hepatitis B shot suddenly become so central in this debate? It’s long been a target of anti-vaccine activists because it is given within the first day of a child’s life. And in today’s Senate hearing, some Republicans sounded on board with making changes: Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) suggested that the timing of the vaccine, which is currently offered to newborn babies, should be pushed back. He argued that unless the mother is known to have hepatitis B, giving the vaccine that early was unnecessary.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the end of the hearing, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), the committee chair, offered a rebuke: He noted that a child infected at birth with hepatitis B has a more than 90 percent chance of developing a chronic infection — and he pointed out that the US used to see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-committee-meeting-infants.html">20,000 babies infected by hepatitis B every year</a>, before the vaccine became standard in the early 1990s. Now it’s less than 20.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“That,” he emphasized, “is an accomplishment to make America healthy again. And we should stand up and salute the people who made the decision, because there are people who would otherwise be dead if their mothers weren’t given the choice of that vaccine.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Cassidy also underscored that the CDC does not <em>mandate</em> the hepatitis B vaccine; it only requires the insurance company to pay for the shot — and that’s only if the parents want it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Now that we’ve controlled [hepatitis B], do we let the genie out of the bottle?” he asked, observing that if the ACIP removes the recommendation for newborns to get the hepatitis B shot, health insurers may no longer cover the cost.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today’s hearing with the former CDC director didn’t result in widespread calls for Kennedy’s resignation. But the opposition to his aggressive overhaul of vaccine policy has been building for some time.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU-ijk73OF0"> grilled Kennedy over the value of vaccines</a> at another hearing earlier this month. Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/gop-lawmakers-dont-sound-enthused-about-rfk-jr-00564704">reported</a> on a growing ambivalence among other GOP lawmakers, too. But Kennedy still has a lot of allies in his corner; except for Cassidy and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), most of the Republican questions for Monarez at the Wednesday hearing were hostile and sought to cast doubt on her credibility.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Cassidy could really escalate the situation. He’s always been the most closely watched Republican senator when it comes to Kennedy and the MAHA agenda. He’s the health committee chair, and because he’s a trained physician, he has a lot of credibility among experts and the public. If he wants to make life difficult for Kennedy, he can — by investigating the health agency, calling for more testimony, and opposing his agenda on the Senate floor.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now Cassidy has all but issued a warning to ACIP and Kennedy against making an unjustified change to the hepatitis B vaccine guidance. They’ll make their countermove in the coming days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You’ve probably seen this one before: first it looks like a rabbit. You’re totally sure: yes, that’s a rabbit! But then — wait, no —&nbsp;it’s a duck. Definitely, absolutely a duck. A few seconds later, it’s flipped again, and all you can see is rabbit.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The feeling of looking at that classic optical illusion is the same feeling I’ve been getting recently as I read two competing stories about the future of AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to one story, <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology">AI is normal technology</a>. It’ll be a big deal, sure —&nbsp;like electricity or the internet was a big deal. But just as society adapted to those innovations, we’ll be able to adapt to advanced AI. As long as we <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362759/ai-interpretability-openai-claude-gemini-neuroscience">research</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/420755/ai-scheming-deception-lessons-from-a-chimp">how to make AI safe</a> and put the right <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/461340/sb53-california-ai-bill-catastrophic-risk-explained">regulations</a> around it, nothing <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment">truly catastrophic</a> will happen. We will not, for instance, go extinct.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s the doomy view best encapsulated by the title of a new book: <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/eliezer-yudkowsky/if-anyone-builds-it-everyone-dies/9780316595643/?lens=little-brown"><em>If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies</em></a><em>.</em> The authors, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares, mean that very literally: a superintelligence —&nbsp;an AI that’s smarter than any human, and smarter than humanity collectively —&nbsp;would kill us all.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not maybe. Pretty much definitely, the authors argue. Yudkowsky, a highly influential AI doomer and founder of the intellectual subculture known as the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/rationalist-movement">Rationalists</a>, has put the odds at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/technology/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-book.html?unlocked_article_code=1.lU8.B7kR.W2LoVZ5BYM9O&amp;smid=url-share">99.5 percent</a>. Soares told me it’s “above 95 percent.” In fact, while many researchers worry about existential risk from AI, he objected to even using the word “risk” here —&nbsp;that’s how sure he is that we’re going to die.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“When you’re careening in a car toward a cliff,” Soares said, “you’re not like, ‘let’s talk about gravity risk, guys.’ You’re like, ‘fucking stop the car!’”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The authors, both at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley, argue that safety research is nowhere near ready to control superintelligent AI, so the only reasonable thing to do is stop all efforts to build it —&nbsp;including by <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">bombing the data centers</a> that power the AIs, if necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While reading this new book, I found myself pulled along by the force of its arguments, many of which are alarmingly compelling. AI sure looked like a rabbit. But then I’d feel a moment of skepticism, and I’d go and look at what the other camp — let’s call them the “normalist” camp&nbsp;—&nbsp;has to say. Here, too, I’d find compelling arguments, and suddenly the duck would come into view.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m trained in philosophy and usually I find it pretty easy to hold up an argument and its counterargument, compare their merits, and say which one seems stronger. But that felt weirdly difficult in this case: It was hard to seriously entertain both views at the same time. Each one seemed so totalizing. You see the rabbit or you see the duck, but you don’t see both together.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That was my clue that what we’re dealing with here is not two sets of arguments, but two fundamentally different worldviews.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A worldview is made of a few different parts, including foundational assumptions, evidence and methods for interpreting evidence, ways of making predictions, and, crucially, values. All these parts interlock to form a unified story about the world. When you’re just looking at the story from the outside, it can be hard to spot if one or two of the parts hidden inside might be faulty — if a foundational assumption is wrong, let’s say, or if a value has been smuggled in there that you disagree with. That can make the whole story look more plausible than it actually is.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you really want to know whether you should believe a particular worldview, you have to pick the story apart. So let’s take a closer look at both the superintelligence story and the normalist story — and then ask whether we might need a different narrative altogether.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The case for believing superintelligent AI would kill us all</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Long before he came to his current doomy ideas, Yudkowsky actually started out wanting to <em>accelerate</em> the creation of superintelligent AI. And he still believes that aligning a superintelligence with human values is possible in principle — we just have no idea how to solve that engineering problem yet&nbsp;—&nbsp;and that superintelligent AI is desirable because it could help humanity resettle in another solar system before our sun dies and destroys our planet. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s literally nothing else our species can bet on in terms of how we eventually end up colonizing the galaxies,” he told me.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But after studying AI more closely, Yudkowsky came to the conclusion that we’re a long, long way away from figuring out how to steer it toward our values and goals. He became one of the original AI doomers, spending the last two decades trying to figure out how we could keep superintelligence from turning against us. He drew acolytes,&nbsp;some of whom were so persuaded by his ideas that they went to work in the major AI labs in hopes of making them safer.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But now, Yudkowsky looks upon even the most well-intentioned AI safety efforts with despair.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because, as Yudkowsky and Soares explain in their book, researchers aren’t building AI — they’re <em>growing</em> it. Normally, when we create some tech —&nbsp;say, a TV —&nbsp;we understand the pieces we’re putting into it and how they work together. But today’s large language models (LLMs) aren’t like that. Companies grow them by shoving reams and reams of text into them, until the models learn to make statistical predictions on their own about what word is likeliest to come next in a sentence. The latest LLMs, called reasoning models, “think” out loud about how to solve a problem —&nbsp;and often solve it very successfully.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nobody understands exactly how the heaps of numbers inside the LLMs make it so they can solve problems — and even when a chatbot seems to be thinking in a human-like way, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/400531/ai-reasoning-models-openai-deepseek">it’s not</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Because we don’t know how AI “minds” work, it’s hard to prevent undesirable outcomes. Take the chatbots that have led people into <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/">psychotic episodes or delusions</a> by being overly supportive of all the users’ thoughts, including the unrealistic ones, to the point of convincing them that they’re messianic figures or geniuses who’ve <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html">discovered a new kind of math</a>. What’s especially worrying is that, even after AI companies <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">have tried</a> to make LLMs less sycophantic, the chatbots have continued to flatter users in dangerous ways. Yet nobody trained the chatbots to push users into psychosis. And if you ask ChatGPT directly whether it should do that, it’ll say no, of course not.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem is that ChatGPT’s knowledge of what should and shouldn&#8217;t be done is not what’s animating it. When it was being trained, humans tended to rate more highly the outputs that sounded affirming or sycophantic. In other words, the evolutionary pressures the chatbot faced when it was “growing up” instilled in it an intense drive to flatter. That drive can become dissociated from the actual outcome it was intended to produce, yielding a strange preference that we humans don’t want in our AIs —&nbsp;but can’t easily remove.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yudkowsky and Soares offer this analogy: Evolution equipped human beings with tastebuds hooked up to reward centers in our brains, so we’d eat the energy-rich foods found in our ancestral environments like sugary berries or fatty elk. But as we got smarter and more technologically adept, we figured out how to make new foods that excite those tastebuds even more —&nbsp;ice cream, say, or Splenda, which contains none of the calories of real sugar. So, we developed a strange preference for Splenda that evolution never intended.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It might sound weird to say that an AI has a “preference.” How can a machine “want” anything? But this is not a claim that the AI <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/414324/ai-consciousness-welfare-suffering-chatgpt-claude">has consciousness or feelings</a>. Rather, all that’s really meant by “wanting” here is that a system is trained to succeed, and it pursues its goal so cleverly and persistently that it’s reasonable to speak of it “wanting” to achieve that goal —&nbsp;just as it’s reasonable to speak of a plant that bends toward the sun as “wanting” the light. (As <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353430/what-if-absolutely-everything-is-conscious">the biologist Michael Levin says</a>, “What most people say is, ‘Oh, that’s just a mechanical system following the laws of physics.’ Well, what do you think <em>you </em>are?”)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you accept that humans are instilling drives in AI, and that those drives can become dissociated from the outcome they were originally intended to produce, you have to entertain a scary thought: What is the AI equivalent of Splenda?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If an AI was trained to talk to users in a way that provokes expressions of delight, for example, “it will prefer humans kept on drugs, or bred and domesticated for delightfulness while otherwise kept in cheap cages all their lives,” Yudkowsky and Soares write. Or it’ll do away with humans altogether and have cheerful chats with synthetic conversation partners. This AI doesn’t care that this isn’t what we had in mind, any more than we care that Splenda isn’t what evolution had in mind. It just cares about finding the most efficient way to produce cheery text.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So, Yudkowsky and Soares argue that advanced AI won’t choose to create a future full of happy, free people, for one simple reason: “Making a future full of flourishing people is not the <em>best, most efficient </em>way to fulfill strange alien purposes. So it wouldn’t happen to do that.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, it would be just as unlikely for the AI to want to keep us happy forever as it is for us to want to just eat berries and elk forever. What’s more, if the AI decides to build machines to have cheery chats with, and if it can build more machines by burning all Earth’s life forms to generate as much energy as possible, why wouldn’t it?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“You wouldn’t need to hate humanity to use their atoms for something else,” Yudkowsky and Soares write.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And, short of breaking the laws of physics, the authors believe that a superintelligent AI would be so smart that it would be able to do anything it decides to do. Sure, AI doesn’t currently have hands to do stuff with, but it could get hired hands&nbsp;— either by paying people to do its bidding online or by using its deep understanding of our psychology and its epic powers of persuasion to convince us into helping it. Eventually it would figure out how to run power plants and factories with robots instead of humans, making us disposable. Then it would dispose of us, because why keep a species around if there’s even a chance it’d get in your way by setting off a nuke or building a rival superintelligence?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I know what you’re thinking: But couldn’t the AI developers just <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/417087/ai-safety-yoshua-bengio-lawzero">command the AI not to hurt humanity</a>? No, the authors say. Not any more than OpenAI can figure out how to make ChatGPT stop being dangerously sycophantic. The bottom line, for Yudkowsky and Soares, is that highly capable AI systems, with goals we cannot fully understand or control, will be able to dispense with anyone who gets in the way without a second thought,&nbsp;or even any malice — just like humans wouldn’t hesitate to destroy an anthill that was in the way of some road we were building.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So if we don’t want superintelligent AI to one day kill us all, they argue, there’s only one option: total nonproliferation. Just as the world created nuclear arms treaties, we need to create global nonproliferation treaties to stop work&nbsp;that could lead to superintelligent AI. All the current bickering over who might win an AI “arms race” —&nbsp;the US or China — is worse than pointless. Because if anyone gets this technology, anyone at all, it will destroy all of humanity.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But what if AI is just normal technology?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology">“AI as Normal Technology,”</a> an important essay that’s gotten a lot of play in the AI world this year, Princeton computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor argue that we shouldn’t think of AI as an alien species. It’s just a tool — one that we can and should remain in control of. And they don’t think maintaining control will necessitate drastic policy changes.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, they don’t think it makes sense to view AI as a superintelligence, either now or in the future. In fact, they reject the whole idea of “superintelligence” as an incoherent construct. And they reject technological determinism, arguing that the doomers are inverting cause and effect by assuming that AI will get to decide its own future, regardless of what humans decide.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yudkowsky and Soares’s argument emphasizes that if we create superintelligent AI, its intelligence will so vastly outstrip our own that it’ll be able to do whatever it wants to us. But there are a few problems with this, Narayanan and Kapoor argue.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the concept of superintelligence is slippery and ill-defined, and that’s allowing Yudkowsky and Soares to use it in a way that is basically synonymous with magic. Yes, <em>magic</em> could break through all our cybersecurity defenses, persuade us to keep giving it money and acting against our own self-interest even after the dangers start becoming more apparent, and so on —&nbsp;but we wouldn’t take this as a serious threat if someone just came out and said “magic.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, what exactly does this argument take “intelligence” to mean? It seems to be treating it as a unitary property (Yudkowsky told me that there’s “a compact, regular story” underlying all intelligence). But intelligence is not one thing, and it’s not measurable on a single continuum. It’s almost certainly <a href="https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/ai-doomerism-is-bullshit">more like a variety of heterogenous things</a> — attention, imagination, curiosity, common sense — and it may well be intertwined with our social cooperativeness, our sensations, and our emotions. Will AI have all of these? Some of these? We aren’t sure of the kind of intelligence AI will attain. Besides, just because an intelligent being has a lot of capability, that doesn’t mean it has a lot of power&nbsp;—&nbsp;the ability to modify the environment —&nbsp;and power is what’s really at stake here.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Why should we be so convinced that humans will just roll over and let AI grab all the power?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s true that we humans <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/truth-terminal-goatse-crypto-millionaire/">have already ceded</a> decision-making power to today’s AIs in unwise ways. But that doesn’t mean we would keep doing that even as the AIs get more capable, the stakes get higher, and the downsides become more glaring. Narayanan and Kapoor believe that, ultimately, we’ll use existing approaches — regulations, auditing and monitoring, fail-safes and the like — to prevent things from going seriously off the rails.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of their main points is that there’s a difference between inventing a technology and deploying it at scale. Just because programmers make an AI, doesn’t mean society will adopt it. “Long before a system would be granted access to consequential decisions, it would need to demonstrate reliable performance in less critical contexts,” write Narayanan and Kapoor. Fail the earlier tests and you don’t get deployed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">They believe that instead of focusing on aligning a model with human values from the get-go —&nbsp;which has long been the dominant AI safety approach, but which is difficult if not impossible given that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/5/7/23708169/ask-ai-chatgpt-ethical-advice-moral-enhancement">what humans want is extremely context-dependent</a> — we should focus our defenses downstream on the places where AI actually gets deployed. For example, the best way to defend against AI-enabled cyberattacks is to beef up existing vulnerability detection programs.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Policy-wise, that leads to the view that we don’t need total nonproliferation. While the superintelligence camp sees nonproliferation as a necessity —&nbsp;if only a small number of governmental actors control advanced AI, international bodies can monitor their behavior —&nbsp;Narayanan and Kapoor note that has the undesirable effect of concentrating power in the hands of a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, since nonproliferation-based safety measures involve the centralization of so much power, that could potentially create a <em>human</em> version of superintelligence: a small cluster of people who are so powerful they could basically do whatever they want to the world. “Paradoxically, they increase the very risks they are intended to defend against,” write&nbsp;Narayanan and Kapoor.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, they argue that we should make AI more open-source and widely accessible so as to prevent market concentration. And we should build a resilient system that monitors AI at every step of the way, so we can decide when it’s okay and when it’s too risky to deploy. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Both the superintelligence view and the normalist view have real flaws</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most glaring flaws of the normalist view is that it doesn’t even try to talk about the military.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet military applications —&nbsp;from autonomous weapons to lightning-fast decision-making about whom to target —&nbsp;are among the most critical for advanced AI. They’re the use cases most likely to make governments feel that all countries absolutely <em>are</em> in an AI arms race, so they must plow ahead,&nbsp;risks be damned. That weakens the normalist camp’s view that we won’t necessarily deploy AI at scale if it seems risky.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Narayanan and Kapoor also argue that regulations and other standard controls will “create multiple layers of protection against catastrophic misalignment.” Reading that reminded me of the Swiss-cheese model we often heard about in the early days of the Covid pandemic —&nbsp;the idea being that if we stack multiple imperfect defenses on top of each other (masks, and also distancing, and also ventilation) the virus is unlikely to break through.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Yudkowsky and Soares think that’s way too optimistic. A superintelligent AI, they say, would be a very smart being with very weird preferences, so it wouldn’t be blindly diving into a wall of cheese.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you ever make something that is<em> trying</em> to get to the stuff on the other side of all your Swiss cheese, it&#8217;s not that hard for it to just route through the holes,” Soares told me.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, even if the AI is a highly agentic, goal-directed being, it’s reasonable to think that some of our defenses can at the very least add friction, making it less likely for it to achieve its goals. The normalist camp is right that you can’t assume all our defenses will be totally worthless, unless you run together two distinct ideas, capability and power.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yudkowsky and Soares are happy to combine these ideas because they believe you can’t get a highly capable AI without also granting it a high degree of agency and autonomy —&nbsp;of power. “I think you basically can&#8217;t make something that&#8217;s really skilled without also having the abilities of being able to take initiative, being able to stay on target, being able to overcome obstacles,” Soares told me.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But capability and power come in degrees, and the only way you can assume the AI will have a near-limitless supply of both is if you assume that maximizing intelligence essentially gets you magic.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Silicon Valley has a deep and abiding <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/silicon-valley-high-iq-children-764234f8?mod=hp_lead_pos9">obsession with intelligence</a>. But the rest of us should be asking: How realistic is that, really?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the normalist camp’s objection that a nonproliferation approach would worsen power dynamics —&nbsp;I think that’s a valid thing to worry about, even though <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23621198/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-china-ai-safety-technology">I have vociferously made the case for slowing down AI</a> and I stand by that. That’s because, like the normalists, I worry not only about what machines do, but also about what people do —&nbsp;including building a society rife with inequality and the concentration of political power.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Soares waved off the concern about centralization.<strong> </strong>“That really seems like the sort of objection you bring up if you don’t think everyone is about to die,” he told me.<strong> </strong>“When there were thermonuclear bombs going off and people were trying to figure out how not to die,&nbsp;you could’ve said, ‘Nuclear arms treaties centralize more power, they give more power to tyrants, won’t that have costs?’ Yeah, it has some costs. But you didn’t see people bringing up those costs who understood that bombs could level cities.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Eliezer Yudkowsky and the Methods of Irrationality? </h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Should we acknowledge that there&#8217;s a chance of human extinction and be appropriately scared of that? Yes. But when faced with a tower of assumptions, of &#8220;maybes&#8221; and &#8220;probablys&#8221; that compound, we should not treat doom as a sure thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact is, we<em> should </em>consider the costs of all possible actions. And we should weigh those costs against the probability that something horrible will happen if we don’t take action to stop AI. The trouble is that Yudkowsky and Soares are so certain that the horrible thing is coming that they are no longer thinking in terms of probabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Which is extremely ironic, because Yudkowsky founded the Rationalist subculture&nbsp;based on the insistence that we must train ourselves to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XTXWPQSEgoMkAupKt/an-intuitive-explanation-of-bayes-s-theorem">reason probabilistically</a>! That insistence runs through everything from his group blog <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> to his popular fanfiction <a href="https://hpmor.com/"><em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em></a>. Yet when it comes to AI, he’s ended up with a totalizing worldview.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And one of the problems with a totalizing worldview is that it means there’s no limit to the sacrifices you’re willing to make to prevent the feared outcome. In <em>If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies</em>, Yudkowsky and Soares allow their concern about the possibility of human annihilation to swamp all other concerns. Above all, they want to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23298870/effective-altruism-longtermism-will-macaskill-future">ensure that humanity can survive millions of years into the future</a>. “We believe that Earth-originating life should go forth and fill the stars with fun and wonder eventually,” they write. And if AI goes wrong, they imagine not only that humans will die at the hands of AI, but that “distant alien life forms will also die, if their star is eaten by the thing that ate Earth… If the aliens were good, all the goodness they could have made of those galaxies will be lost.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To prevent the feared outcome, the book specifies that if a foreign power proceeds with building superintelligent AI, our government should be ready to launch an airstrike on their data center, even if they’ve warned that they’ll retaliate with nuclear war. In 2023, when Yudkowsky was asked about nuclear war and how many people should be allowed to die in order to prevent superintelligence, he <a href="https://betweendrafts.com/justdrafts/2023/04/11/why-eliezer-yudkowskys-time-op-ed-on-how-current-ai-systems-will-kill-us-all-is-even-more-unhinged-than-you-think/">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">There should be enough survivors on Earth in close contact to form a viable reproduction population, with room to spare, and they should have a sustainable food supply. So long as that’s true, there’s still a chance of reaching the stars someday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Remember that worldviews involve not just objective evidence, but also values. When you’re dead set on reaching the stars, you may be willing to sacrifice millions of human lives if it means reducing the risk that we never set up shop in space. That may work out from a species perspective. But the millions of humans on the altar might feel some type of way about it, particularly if they believed the extinction risk from AI was closer to 5 percent than 95 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, Yudkowsky and Soares don’t come out and own that they’re selling a worldview. And on that score, the normalist camp does them one better. Narayanan and Kapoor at least explicitly acknowledge that they’re proposing a worldview, which is a mixture of truth claims (descriptions) and values (prescriptions). It is as much an aesthetic as it is an argument.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We need a third story about AI risk</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some thinkers have begun to sense that we need new ways to talk about AI risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The philosopher Atoosa Kasirzadeh was one of the first to lay out a comprehensive alternative path. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07836">In her telling</a>, AI is not totally normal technology, nor is it necessarily destined to become an uncontrollable superintelligence that destroys humanity in a single, sudden, decisive cataclysm. Instead, she argues that an “accumulative” picture of AI risk is more plausible.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Specifically, she’s worried about “the gradual accumulation of smaller, seemingly non-existential, AI risks eventually surpassing critical thresholds.” She adds, “These risks are typically referred to as ethical or social risks.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s been a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/8/10/23298108/ai-dangers-ethics-alignment-present-future-risk">long-running fight</a> between “AI ethics” people who worry about the current harms of AI, like entrenching bias, surveillance, and misinformation, and “AI safety” people who worry about potential existential risks. But if AI were to cause enough mayhem on the ethical or social front, Kasirzadeh notes, that in itself could irrevocably devastate humanity’s future:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">AI-driven disruptions can accumulate and interact over time, progressively weakening the resilience of critical societal systems, from democratic institutions and economic markets to social trust networks. When these systems become sufficiently fragile, a modest perturbation could trigger cascading failures that propagate through the interdependence of these systems.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">She illustrates this with a concrete scenario: Imagine it’s 2040 and AI has reshaped our lives. The information ecosystem is so polluted by deepfakes and misinformation that we’re barely capable of rational public discourse. AI-enabled mass surveillance has had a chilling effect on our ability to dissent, so democracy is faltering. Automation has produced massive unemployment, and universal basic income has failed to materialize due to corporate resistance to the necessary taxation, so wealth inequality is at an all-time high. Discrimination has become further entrenched, so social unrest is brewing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now imagine there’s a cyberattack. It targets power grids across three continents. The blackouts cause widespread chaos, triggering a domino effect that causes financial markets to crash. The economic fallout fuels protests and riots that become more violent because of the seeds of distrust already sown by disinformation campaigns. As nations struggle with internal crises, regional conflicts escalate into bigger wars, with aggressive military actions that leverage AI technologies. The world goes kaboom.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I find this perfect-storm scenario, where catastrophe arises from the compounding failure of multiple key systems, disturbingly plausible.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kasirzadeh’s story is a parsimonious one. It doesn’t require you to believe in an ill-defined “superintelligence.” It doesn’t require you to believe that humans will hand over all power to AI without a second thought. It also doesn’t require you to believe that AI is a super normal technology that we can make predictions about without foregrounding its implications for militaries and for geopolitics.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Increasingly, other AI researchers are coming to see this accumulative view of AI risk as more and more plausible; one paper memorably refers to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16946">“gradual disempowerment&#8221;</a> view — that is, that human influence over the world will slowly wane as more and more decision-making is outsourced to AI, until one day we wake up and realize that the machines are running us rather than the other way around. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And if you take this accumulative view, the policy implications are neither what Yudkowsky and Soares recommend (total nonproliferation) nor what Narayanan and Kapoor recommend (making AI more open-source and widely accessible).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kasirzadeh does want there to be more guardrails around AI than there currently are, including both a network of oversight bodies monitoring specific subsystems for accumulating risk <em>and</em> more centralized oversight for the most advanced AI development.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But she also wants us to keep reaping the benefits of AI when the risks are low (DeepMind’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22045713/ai-artificial-intelligence-deepmind-protein-folding">AlphaFold</a>, which could help us discover cures for diseases, is a great example). Most crucially, she wants us to adopt a systems analysis approach to AI risk, where we focus on increasing the resilience of each component part of a functioning civilization, because we understand that if enough components degrade, the whole machinery of civilization could collapse.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Her systems analysis stands in contrast to Yudkowsky’s view, she said. “I think that way of thinking is very a-systemic. It’s the most simple model of the world you can assume,” she told me. “And his vision is based on Bayes’ theorem — the whole probabilistic way of thinking about the world&nbsp;—&nbsp;so it’s super surprising how such a mindset has ended up pushing for a statement of ‘if anyone builds it, everyone dies’ —&nbsp;which is, by definition, a non-probabilistic statement.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I asked her why she thinks that happened.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Maybe it’s because he really, really believes in the truth of the axioms or presumptions of his argument. But we all know that in an uncertain world, you cannot necessarily believe with certainty in your axioms,” she said. “The world is a complex story.”&nbsp; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Vox’s climate desk, we’ve spent the past few months digging into a threat that’s easy to swat away in the moment — but increasingly harder to escape: the rise of mosquito and other vector-borne diseases in the United States.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of us think of mosquitoes as little more than a summer nuisance. But climate change, urban sprawl, and global travel are reshaping their reach — and the range of the diseases they carry. Already, West Nile is entrenched across much of the country. Dengue, chikungunya, and even malaria are beginning to take root again. And now, another menace may be on the way: The <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/418186/oropouche-virus-disease-midge-infection-brazil-outbreak">Oropouche virus</a>, once confined to the Amazon, is spreading in cities across South America and has already appeared in travelers returning to the US.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Our climate correspondent <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/umair-irfan">Umair Irfan</a> has been tracing this shift from multiple angles. His field reporting from Texas, where researchers are running one of the country’s most advanced mosquito surveillance systems, shows how close we are to outbreaks slipping past our defenses. His reporting also highlights how fragile US public health capacity has become, just as the risks are accelerating. To help readers understand these threats, he’s also built a practical guide: how to identify the seven mosquito species that matter most for disease in the US.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Taken together, these stories are far more than just a climate or a science story; they capture the bigger picture of a major public health threat that intersects with the lives of people across the country. Whether you live in Houston or Boston, what’s happening in the world of vector-borne disease will shape your summers, your neighborhoods, and your health.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can find all of our stories below, but I recommend you start with <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/460342/mosquito-vector-borne-disease-infection-malaria-west-nile-dengue">our illustrated guide</a> to the seven most dangerous mosquitoes in the US. Because what used to be called “tropical disease” is no longer all that tropical, and it’s important for all of us to stay vigilant. —<em>Paige Vega, climate editor</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Austin, Texas — </strong>Under a microscope, a mosquito can look stunning. Their blue-green iridescent scales, purple bands, and attractive spotted wings shimmer — dazzling enough to forget, for a moment, the insect lives to take a sip of your blood. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Mosquitoes range in size, from smaller than your pinky fingernail to a commanding presence in your palm, but it takes a skilled eye and a steady hand to sort the most dangerous species. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the Arbovirus-Entomology Laboratory of the Texas State Department of Public Health Services, getting a close-up look is a key step in an active statewide effort to keep vector-borne diseases at bay — and alert the rest of the country when a major outbreak is looming.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/DSC00785.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.02498750624688,100,99.950024987506" alt="Close-up of a hand holding a small, round dish full of dead mosquitoes." title="Close-up of a hand holding a small, round dish full of dead mosquitoes." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Dr. Bethany Bolling points out different mosquito species submitted to the state arbovirus entomology lab for analysis. | Umair Irfan/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Umair Irfan/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The US has proved successful in driving away some of the most common mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria and yellow fever, during the 20th century. With less worries about insect-borne illnesses, there are few local and state health agencies in the US investing in active efforts to find and eliminate dangerous insects. Now, these old diseases are starting to creep back in, and new ones are lurking in stagnant puddles, garbage dumps, and culverts. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vector-borne-diseases/about/index.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> report that the rates of infections spread by animals has more than doubled over the past 20 years. Yet, the picture of these illnesses across the US is spotty at best, and they are likely far more prevalent than we may realize. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">However, Texas has been looking out for mosquitoes since 1954, and it’s still a priority. “Texas and Florida are the most vulnerable. … A lot of times, we&#8217;re the ones that see the first human cases of emerging diseases because of our climate, the vectors that we have, and the population levels,” said Bethany Bolling, who manages the zoonotic virology group at the Texas state health department. “We have active programs throughout Texas that are weekly collecting mosquitoes. We&#8217;re monitoring the population levels. We monitor the species, where they are. And then we&#8217;re also looking for pathogens.” The state of Texas spends $755,000 per year on its arbovirus surveillance program and employs seven molecular biologists on the team.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the US as a whole is not investing enough to contain the threat, and even Texas is scrambling to keep up. This year, West Nile virus, which is mainly spread by mosquitoes from the Culex genus, has been detected in 37 states — including <a href="https://www.kxii.com/2025/09/03/mosquitoes-with-west-nile-virus-found-two-grayson-county-cities/">Texas</a>, <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/west-nile-virus-essex-county-human-case/65973252">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2025/09/03/8-human-cases-of-west-nile-virus-1-death-detected-in-utah-davis-counties/">Utah</a> — causing at least one death. The CDC has tallied at least <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/current-year-data.html">500 cases</a> across the country this year so far.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/DSC00746.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.078003120124805,100,99.84399375975" alt="A woman holds a round container up to the camera." title="A woman holds a round container up to the camera." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Dr. Bolling holds up a container of mosquito specimens. | Umair Irfan/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Umair Irfan/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The US is also contending with a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/outbreaks/2024/index.html">dengue outbreak</a> in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands that began last year. The disease is spread by Aedes mosquitoes, and since 2024, health officials have detected <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/outbreaks/2024/index.html">locally acquired cases</a> in Texas, California, and Florida. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There have been at least <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html">60 cases of Chikungunya</a> found in travelers returning to the US this year but no local spread so far. The disease, also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, <a href="https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/2025-ago-28-phe-alerta-chkvorovengfinal_1.pdf">arrived in the Americas</a> in 2013. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The US typically sees about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/php/surveillance-report/index.html">2,000 malaria cases</a> per year in travelers coming into the country, but in 2023, health officials identified the <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/2023/6/23/23771154/malaria-transmission-florida-texas-mosquitoes-risk-prevention-anopheles">first locally acquired malaria cases</a> in 20 years in Florida and Texas. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of these infections don’t have cures, so preventing them in the first place remains the most effective tactic. Yet, at a time when the US public health system needs more money, staff, and research to stay ahead of these diseases, the Trump administration is pulling it apart, with across-the-board <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx29rdpg45xo">job cuts</a> at the CDC and more targeted cuts aimed at <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2025/08/20/trumps-global-health-cuts-upend-cdcs-malaria-work-00515726">global vector-borne disease monitoring</a> and <a href="https://grist.org/politics/dengue-climate-change-trump-cuts-nih-funding-mosquito-borne-disease/">research into the role of climate change</a>. Federal health officials are also <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/climate-change-health-equity-environmental-justice/climate-change-health-equity/climate-health-outlook/vector-pathogen-ecology/index.html">undermining confidence in vaccines</a>, a critical tool that could help limit the damage from vector-borne disease. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And as the researchers in Austin have learned, there’s only so much they can do from the lab.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Containing disease-spreading mosquitoes demands a holistic strategy that includes maintaining natural ecosystems that house natural mosquito predators, improving the housing stock to prevent indoor bites, and training a new generation of insect-borne pathogen specialists to carry on this work.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/DSC00779.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A tube containing &lt;em&gt;Culex quinquefasciatus&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes being prepared virus screening. | Umair Irfan/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Umair Irfan/Vox" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Texas is an underrated hotspot for vector-borne disease</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The words “vector-borne disease” might evoke images of humid, tropical jungles and scenes of poverty. So, Texas might not be the first place that comes to mind. But the state has a long history with these illnesses, and many of the factors that worsen them intersect in the Lone Star State: year-round mosquito weather, rising average temperatures, more <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-flood-climate-change-drought-rainfall-23bfa1a45d9897676b0fe27c81c6fa2d">severe rainfall</a>, a <a href="https://demographics.texas.gov/Visualizations/2024/Estimates2024/">growing population</a>, plenty of travelers and migrants, and expanding urban and suburban sprawl. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why I was so interested in seeing how Texas is managing these threats and what lessons the rest of the country can learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Austin, the Texas State Department of Health Services operates a laboratory at the northwest corner of town to keep an eye on diseases spread by animals — not just mosquitoes, but ticks, midges, and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-09-01/chagas-disease-the-deadly-disease-youve-never-heard-of-but-is-here">kissing bugs</a>. (Lyme disease, spread by ticks, is actually the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/climate-change-health-equity-environmental-justice/climate-change-health-equity/climate-health-outlook/vector-pathogen-ecology/index.html">most common vector-borne disease</a> in the US, and the State of Texas <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/tick-borne-diseases/tick-submission-testing">tests and tracks ticks, as well</a>). They also monitor diseases, like rabies, that are spread by mammals. Local health departments across the state send suspected insects, bats, and dogs to Austin to see if they’re carrying anything dangerous. “We get animal heads from all over the state for rabies testing,” Bolling said. </p>

The colony serves as susceptible control mosquitoes for insecticide resistance testing. | Umair Irfan/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Umair Irfan/Vox" /></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Often, the initial outbreaks of vector-borne disease occur in rural or remote areas, and the origins are discovered long after an outbreak is underway. Some cities like Brownsville, right on the US-Mexico border, have built their own in-house system for trapping, tracking, and spraying for mosquitoes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But most of the Lone Star State’s 254 counties aren’t looking at all. “Only about 20 percent of Texas counties do active surveillance,” said Bolling. “We wish we had eyes on more parts of Texas and knew what mosquitoes were there and what pathogens were circulating.” That means, most often, local officials start collecting vectors after people are already getting sick, and since they don’t have the tools to see what’s being spread, they send their mosquitoes to Austin. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On a map, Bolling pointed out that most of the mosquitoes sent to the lab come from major metro areas like Dallas and San Antonio. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of centered around where there&#8217;s more people, more money, more resources to participate in our program,” Bolling said. “We offer our test services free of charge, but the [local] programs have to have their own mosquito traps. They have to have people to put them out, and they have to pay to ship us the mosquitoes.” That means some of the more remote and lower-income parts of the state, where outbreaks often start, may not realize what they’re dealing with right away when people start falling ill. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Bolling walked me through two sets of double doors into a series of air-pressure controlled laboratories kitted out with fume hoods, microscopes, and PCR machines. Scientists in lab coats, googles, and gloves carefully took mosquitoes out of minus 80 degree Fahrenheit freezers and sorted them, getting a close look at the species buzzing around from far-flung corners of the state. “We do have beautiful mosquitoes,” said Bolling, who said one of her favorites is Culex tarsalis, which looks like it has racing stripes. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/DSC00803.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="3 round scientific machine sit on a line on a desktop." title="3 round scientific machine sit on a line on a desktop." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A row of automated extraction instruments used to extract and purify viral RNA from homogenized mosquito pools. | Umair Irfan/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Umair Irfan/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The goal is to put together a picture of which diseases are circulating, which bugs are spreading them, and which tactics could break the cycle.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Why go through all this trouble? Why not just saturate a city in insecticide when an outbreak starts?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, spraying is expensive, and it’s not always effective. Local governments facing a mosquito outbreak want to make sure they’re spending their limited dollars wisely. Also, mosquitoes can develop a resistance to repeated exposures, kind of like how bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics. These chemicals can also be detrimental to other insects that are critical pollinators, like bees, or important food for other animals, like bats, so it’s important to tailor the right chemicals to specific mosquitoes in the proper quantities.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are even some mosquitoes that are “good,” like the Toxorhynchites mosquito, also known as the elephant mosquito. “What&#8217;s nice about it, it&#8217;s a really large mosquito and it doesn&#8217;t feed on humans, so it&#8217;s not a concern as far as vector-borne diseases,” Bolling said. Plus, “they’re predacious on other mosquito larvae, so they can be used as a biocontrol.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Containing mosquitoes requires sophisticated tools — and a new cadre of experts</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The mosquito surveillance work in states like Texas, Florida, and California can raise the alarm for the rest of the country during a vector-borne disease outbreak. And by filling in the blanks, scientists hope to find patterns in mosquito disease outbreaks that they can use to predict the next ones.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“We still don&#8217;t have good forecasting tools for that, but there do seem to be triggers like shorter winters, earlier springs, and more rainfall, particularly,” said Ben Beard, deputy director of CDC’s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/DSC00812.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="An open computer with a chart showing the results of a PCR test in blue." title="An open computer with a chart showing the results of a PCR test in blue." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The results of a PCR test can determine whether a specific pathogen is present in a mosquito sample, but only if scientists know what to look for. | Umair Irfan/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Umair Irfan/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The challenge is acting on warnings, particularly when it comes to a danger that a city or state hasn’t seen before. The public health system tends to be reactive and based on finding already known threats. It’s especially hard for local and state governments to muster the resources to deal with intermittent problems like vector-borne disease outbreaks, where years can go by without big spikes in infection rates. That makes it difficult to secure funding for surveillance, research, and personnel to stay ahead of established perils, let alone deal with invasive mosquito species bringing never-before-seen diseases into new areas. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, PCR tests can amplify the genetic material of a virus in a mosquito sample, but the technique requires knowing a part of the genome of the target. You have to already know what’s in the realm of possibility before you can see if it’s there or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To find new, previously unknown diseases spread by mosquitoes, scientists have to do something much more complex: a cell culture assay. That means growing a population of cells and trying to see if there are any germs inside a mosquito that can infect them. It’s an involved and expensive process, and few labs in the US are set up to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But this work is currently paused in Texas. “We&#8217;re short-staffed a couple of people right now, so we had to put that on hold,” Bolling said. “It&#8217;s unfortunate because that&#8217;s an important part of our program.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The problems for vector-borne disease surveillance aren’t limited by the technology and funding; it’s the expertise. It’s hard to get more people into this career since the job prospects can be spotty.  “We need more public health insect researchers,” said Beard, from the CDC.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/DSC00808.ARW-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A man in a white lab coat and purple gloves performs a procedure with a pipette." title="A man in a white lab coat and purple gloves performs a procedure with a pipette." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Molecular biologist Jeffrey Moore transfers extracted mosquito RNA to a plate for arbovirus PCR testing. | Umair Irfan/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Umair Irfan/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Erika Machtinger, an associate professor of entomology at Pennsylvania State University, recently helped <a href="https://entsoc.org/event-calendar/bites-insights-hands-ectoparasite-and-vector-identification-collection-and">organize a crash course workshop</a> to train health workers to spot dangerous bugs. In a hotel conference room in Baltimore, Maryland, she and her colleagues invited local health officials from around the country to rotate between stations to identify mosquitoes, ticks, and parasites. They practiced collection methods, like setting up mosquito traps, and went over safety precautions, like tucking pants into socks.  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The goal is to help health departments build more connections with their natural environment and understand how changes in forests, wetlands, and deserts can alter the landscape of health risks. “Vector biology surveillance and management training is more necessary now for public health,” Machtinger said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is encapsulated in the idea of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html">“one health</a>,” a philosophy that links the integrity of the natural world to human health. In the case of vector-borne disease, the goal is not necessarily to eradicate mosquitoes or disease but to anticipate them and reduce their harm to people. That means spotting dangerous mosquitoes as well as rethinking how we plan neighborhoods, to creating habitats for mosquito predators, to using porous materials to prevent standing water. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/DSC00776.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A woman in a lab coat looks into a lab-grade microscope." title="A woman in a lab coat looks into a lab-grade microscope." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Molecular biologist Kim McNair identifies and sorts mosquito trap collections on a chill table, separating species and collecting vectors for further testing. | Umair Irfan/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Umair Irfan/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">It also requires building a more sophisticated operation to proactively look for disease. The CDC set up <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/php/arbonet/index.html">ArboNET</a>, which it describes as a “passive surveillance system.” “It is dependent on clinicians considering the diagnosis of an arboviral disease and obtaining the appropriate diagnostic test, and reporting of laboratory-confirmed cases to public health authorities,” according to the CDC’s website. “Diagnosis and reporting are incomplete, and the incidence of arboviral diseases is underestimated.” In 2023, the CDC also set up regional <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vector-borne-diseases/what-cdc-is-doing/regional-training-and-evaluation-centers-1.html">training and evaluation centers</a> to build up capacity to anticipate, prevent, and manage vector-borne disease outbreaks. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But, as the need for more mosquito control tactics is growing, resources are drying up. Many state and local governments are <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/over-half-us-states-bleeding-114400264.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGH7A8EQ2ZHVc1LYCyuMmGiEPa1tZ_1C8ZvwLjiiMNPDdcbhmbKqr3GQAokQoI5LqMAHi_oxFX5TxhO4Ri9lo2oiCCvK9mbO8yhySrTYOOJUq26jcn8xGXegAiMT2rirt7LdbMkR3547FzXcnxAxA2o4oZQC4Rb8cuoFOnFmrDtl">facing a cash crunch</a> — not just for public health, but for all government services. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration is undermining this work, too, with <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/trump-administrations-deep-cuts-to-public-health-leave-system-reeling">deep cuts to staffing and budgets</a> across the board in public health, including<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mass-layoffs-begin-hhs-reaching-impacts-public-health/story?id=120374327"> 2,400 personnel at the CDC</a>, about one-fifth of the agency’s workforce. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The administration has directed much of its ire to research on <a href="https://grist.org/politics/dengue-climate-change-trump-cuts-nih-funding-mosquito-borne-disease/">climate change and public health</a>, drawing down research dollars at the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nih-funding-climate-change-public-health#:~:text=the%20audio%20element.-,The%20National%20Institutes%20of%20Health%20will%20no%20longer%20be%20funding,internal%20records%20reviewed%20by%20ProPublica.">National Institutes of Health</a> for things like developing models for mosquito-borne disease transmission. Officials like US Health <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/459226/rfk-jr-trump-covid-vaccine-ban">Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> are also undermining <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/459226/rfk-jr-trump-covid-vaccine-ban">confidence in vaccines</a>. There are few vector-borne disease vaccines available for US residents, but there are several under development that health officials were hoping could be a key way to contain the danger. Now, those efforts are stalled.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For many local and state health departments, it means they’re on their own when it comes to facing the specter of vector-borne disease. It’s all the more frustrating knowing that many of these problems are manageable with simple interventions like dumping standing water, wearing repellents, and carefully applying insecticides.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Tiny as they may be, mosquitoes are a danger that we can see coming, and the infections they carry can be stopped. Turning a deadly menace into merely an itchy annoyance demands foresight, planning, money, and people dedicated to containing these pretty little biters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the country, ordinary Americans are being fired for <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/charlie-kirks-allies-warn-americans-mourn-him-properly-or-else/">expressing their opinions about Charlie Kirk’s killing</a>. Sometimes, those opinions are despicable —&nbsp;like support for his assassination. But in other cases they are anodyne, like expressing distaste for some of Kirk’s offensive statements in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Prominent right-wing voices, like Laura Loomer and the social media account Libs of TikTok, are gleefully identifying more targets — including police officers, high school teachers, and nurses. An anonymous website, called the Charlie Kirk Data Foundation, is building a blacklist based on <a href="https://x.com/forcharliekirk1/status/1967358027687993610">more than 60,000 reports</a> of allegedly unacceptable reactions to the killing.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Guest-hosting Kirk’s radio show on Monday, Vice President JD Vance <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/15/vance-charlie-kirk-podcast-episode/">encouraged people</a> to “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jd-vance-charlie-kirk-death-celebration-call-employers-2025-9">call their employers</a>” when they see someone celebrating Kirk’s killing. Chillingly, both he and guest Stephen Miller vowed <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1967659982507372822">a federal crackdown on left-wing organizations</a> that they claimed, without an iota of evidence, bore some responsibility for Kirk’s death.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The last message that Charlie sent me was…that we need to have an organized strategy to go after the left-wing organizations that are promoting violence in this country. And I will write those words on my heart and I will carry them out,” <a href="https://x.com/theblaze/status/1967629142318285005">Miller said</a>. “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have to the DOJ, DHS, and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks. It will happen and we will do it in Charlie&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/charlie-kirk-shooting-death-republican-reaction-456d6237?mod=politics_lead_story">the Wall Street Journal</a>, some of the policies under consideration — for deployment “as soon as this week” —&nbsp;include stripping left-wing organizations’ tax-exempt status and weaponizing anti-corruption laws against them. Already, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is claiming to be <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5505556-rubio-visa-revocations-charlie-kirk-assassination/">screening visa applications</a> based on social media statements about Kirk. Attorney General Pam Bondi has <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/pam-bondis-ridiculous-24-hours/">threatened</a> (unconstitutionally) to prosecute anyone engaging in “hate speech” relating to Kirk’s death — and to punish employers if they <em>fail</em> to fire their staff members who have impugned his memory.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Employers, you have to have an obligation to get rid of people. You need to look at people who are saying horrible things. And they shouldn’t be working with you,” she said <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/pam-bondis-ridiculous-24-hours/">on Fox News</a>. “If you wanna go in and print posters with Charlie’s pictures on them for a vigil, you have to let them do that. We can prosecute you for that.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked by a reporter on Tuesday about Bondi’s “hate speech” comments, President Donald Trump threatened to prosecute the press. “We’ll probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly. It’s hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart,” <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1967957633370828892">he said</a>. Indeed, hours before those comments, Trump filed a $15 billion lawsuit against the New York Times — preposterously claiming the paper’s critical coverage <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/business/media/trump-lawsuit-new-york-times.html">constituted a form of defamation</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When I <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461101/charlie-kirk-assassination-murder-dead-democracy">warned of a coming democratic crisis</a> on the day of Kirk’s killing, this is exactly what I had in mind. Though the American right had spent years bemoaning “cancel culture” and the death of free speech, it was clear that the Trump administration and the aligned MAGA movement were fully comfortable with wielding political power against its opponents —&nbsp;in using their control over the state to repress. Kirk’s death has turned this impulse up to 11.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The darkest and most illiberal elements of the right are working to develop a broad-based campaign for repressing the political opposition. It’s a moment very much akin to the Red Scares of the 20th century, in that allegations of dangerous radical influence are fueling a wider assault on free expression. This time, it’s taking place amid the heightened emotions after a tragic killing, employing the vast monitoring capabilities created by social media, and explicitly treating a broad swath of the American left (rather than a communist fringe) as the source of the extremist threat.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is, in short, a defining moment for American democracy: a test of whether its capacities to protect core democratic freedoms have atrophied past the point of effective resistance.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">All-American repression</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve written extensively about <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian">the intellectual right’s “postliberal” turn</a>: its growing belief that the very idea of a society centering the protection of individual liberties is a mistake, and that the state should serve as an authoritative guide forcing its citizens to embrace a conservative way of life.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What we are seeing, post-Kirk, is this doctrine being applied to the domain of free speech.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“We had an open marketplace of ideas; the Left shot it up,” <a href="https://x.com/michaeljknowles/status/1966627316551016927">writes Michael Knowles</a>, a prominent postliberal pundit at the Daily Wire. “We must stigmatize certain evil ideas and behaviors, and we must ostracize people who insist upon them. More practically, this means that people who persist in such disorder should lose their social standing. In certain cases, they should lose their jobs. There must be consequences.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In its attempt to impose such “consequences,” the Trump administration and its allies are borrowing — at times consciously — from multiple different episodes of repression in American history.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The most important reference points are, as I suggested, the two Red Scares: the twinned panics, after each world war, that the United States was being infiltrated by communists. In both cases, the state targeted political dissidents for repression — most famously in the 1919 and 1920 “Palmer Raids,” mass arrests of alleged communists, and Sen. Joe McCarthy’s reign of terror in the late 1940s and early 1950s.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Red Scares both had a minimal grounding in truth, in the sense that there were communist agitators and spies in the United States. But the scope of the problem was wildly inflated to justify a state-sponsored crackdown on the free speech rights of those whom the people in power disliked.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, the allegedly pro-violence “radical left” is playing the role of the communists. There is, indeed, such a radical left. But once again, the scope of the problem is being radically overstated — such people are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-democrats-social-media/684194/">not a meaningful presence</a> in the Democratic Party or major liberal NGOs —&nbsp;in order to justify the broader attack not just on a radical political fringe, but on the White House’s opposition writ large. There is a reason why this crackdown is being led by people like Laura Loomer, an informal adviser to the administration and far-right influencer who recently described one of her political goals as “<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/laura-loomer-really-might-be-the-new-joe-mccarthy.html">make McCarthy great again</a>.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Red Scares thus provide the basic structure of what’s happening: exaggerate a radical threat to justify state repression. But some of the more specific tactics borrow from more recent episodes.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The first is the war on terror. During that period, an immediate horror — the 9/11 attacks — created a broad national expectation that any dissent from the presidential administration’s dominant line would constitute a kind of offense against the honored dead. One might recall <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/18/dixie-chicks-used-and-abused-by-everybody-who-wanted-to-make-money-off-us">the wave of hatred directed at the Dixie Chicks</a> after the country artists expressed shame over the Iraq War, or <a href="https://www.aaup.org/JAF3/report-termination-ward-churchill">the persecution and ultimate firing of University of Colorado professor Ward Churchill</a> after his (admittedly ghoulish) description of 9/11 as chickens coming home to roost.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The key to this period, the glue binding the censorial consensus, was a shared belief among the American elite that 9/11 was an attack on America writ large — and that, in its wake, you were (in President <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html">George W. Bush’s terms</a>) either with us or against us as a collective. The current right is trying to exploit the horror of Kirk’s killing in the same way, to create a climate of enforced consensus out of the immediate (and correct) emotional horror at the evil of his killing.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Not cancel culture, but something worse</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second antecedent to this moment is the much-discussed “cancel culture” of the past 10 years. It is not that the right is “borrowing” a left-wing desire to censor, but rather, that it is adapting the modern technology<em> </em>of cancellation. Social media turns anyone into a potential microcelebrity: Statements once preserved for friends and family members are now broadcast to the world, where outrage merchants can weaponize those statements for the all-important currency of attention and, ultimately, get their targets fired.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I have long been a skeptic of the impact of “cancel culture” on the American elite, who I think <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/22/21325942/free-speech-harpers-letter-bari-weiss-andrew-sullivan">radically overstated their own plight</a>. But the elevation of ordinary citizens into hate objects has always concerned me: Such targeting did not raise tricky conversations about what the moral boundaries of public discourse should be (e.g., platforming Nazis or terrorist apologists), but rather whether private citizens have a right to speak their mind and retain the means to sustain their lives economically.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For all its criticisms of left-wing culture, the right is gleefully deploying the technology of cancellation to try and punish ordinary citizens who hold left-wing political views. The pretext for targeting such people is that they celebrated Kirk’s death, at times, but at others it’s that they merely said they hated his politics or weren’t especially sorry that he was dead. The idea that an elder care worker or police officer — two recent targets of Libs of TikTok — should be fired for any of these views clearly crosses core free speech red lines.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What you have, in short, are the beginnings of a new Red Scare that exploits the emotional fallout of political violence and the technology of modern cancellations to expand its own repressive power. That may sound bad enough, but —&nbsp;if anything — it understates the severity of the problem.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During the second Red Scare, Joe McCarthy was a senator, not the president&nbsp;—&nbsp;and the Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, <a href="https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2015/fall/ike-mccarthy">ultimately helped engineer his downfall</a>. Yet today, the president is Donald Trump —&nbsp;who has fully backed the McCarthyite wing of his administration.<strong> </strong>Presidential involvement fundamentally changes the game: it puts the full repressive power of the modern US government, most notably federal law enforcement, in the hands of people like Stephen Miller. The <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2021-08-24/resistance-futile">immense reach of the post-9/11 security state</a>, now able to monitor people in minute detail on social media, gives them unprecedented capabilities to punish disfavored speech —&nbsp;especially given the administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/opinion/trump-constitution-rule-of-law.html">track record of ignoring statutory limits</a> on its power.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And Trump seems to enjoy <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1967967171796926794">full support</a> from his party leadership; there is no Eisenhower waiting in the wings. And his ultimate target is not really radical subversives, but the core of the Democratic Party itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Welcome to The Logoff:</strong> President Donald Trump is suing the New York Times for defamation, demanding $15 billion in damages as part of his latest attack on the free press.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What does the lawsuit say?</strong> Trump alleges that three New York Times articles published in 2024 were written to undermine his campaign in the closing stretch of the election, and the suit names four Times journalists and the publisher of a book by two of the reporters, as co-defendants.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The suit also includes aggrandizing descriptions of Trump’s career, including his “magnificent real estate achievements” and his “<em>sui generis</em> charisma and unique business acumen.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a statement, the Times said that Trump’s suit “lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the goal of the lawsuit?</strong> In theory, the suit is intended to recoup damages for what it describes as “false, malicious, defamatory, and disparaging” reporting. In reality, the complaint — and the eye-popping request for damages — is best seen as part of a larger pattern of behavior by Trump that is intended to suppress legitimate, critical reporting on Trump’s life, campaign, and administration by US news organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is Trump going to succeed?</strong> Almost certainly not. Defamation suits against a public figure have to meet an extremely high bar, called actual malice, to succeed, and truth is an absolute defense.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the big picture?</strong> Trump’s attacks on the media are intended to coerce more favorable coverage of his administration. He has previously sued both ABC and CBS for their coverage, extracting settlements worth millions of dollars, and he has a pending $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, he told ABC reporter Jonathan Karl that the Justice Department might “go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">And with that, it’s time to log off…</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Robert Redford, the legendary actor and director, died today at 89. The Washington Post has a great list of some of his best works <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2025/09/16/robert-redford-movie-roles/">here</a> (and what kind of journalists would we be if we didn’t mention his role as journalism legend Bob Woodward in <em>All the President’s Men</em>), but I want to point to this clip, from <a href="https://x.com/jaketapper/status/1967956108854858125"><em>A River Runs Through It</em></a>, too. The film, directed by Redford, is a beautiful adaptation of what Roger Ebert described as “one of the few perfect books of the 20th century,” and it’s one that Redford <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/redfords-cast-into-past-a-tale-runs-through-it">fought hard to get made</a>. If you’re looking for something to watch in his memory, I highly recommend it. Have a great evening! </p>

In a trio of cases, two currently pending before the Supreme Court and one that is likely to land on the justices’ doorstep as soon as Tuesday, President Donald Trump claims new powers that, if he prevails, would give him near-total control over all US fiscal and monetary policy. The first is the ongoing litigation [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a trio of cases, two currently pending before the Supreme Court and one that is likely to land on the justices’ doorstep as soon as Tuesday, President Donald Trump claims new powers that, if he prevails, would give him near-total control over all US fiscal and monetary policy.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The first is the ongoing litigation over Trump’s tariffs. The Court plans to hear two challenges to the tariffs, known as <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/trump-v-v-o-s-selections/"><em>Trump v. V.O.S. Selections</em></a> and <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/learning-resources-inc-v-trump/"><em>Learning Resources v. Trump</em></a>, in November.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At least 10 federal judges have concluded that <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/460312/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-vos-selections">Trump exceeded his authority</a> when he imposed many of the ever-shifting import taxes that have defined his second term in office. And the amount of money at stake here is massive — Trump’s lawyers estimate that the tariffs “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26082943-20250903-trump-v-vos-selections-cert-petition/">will reduce federal deficits by $4 trillion in the coming years</a>.” Yale’s Budget Lab <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-4-2025">estimates that they will raise $2.4 trillion</a> if they remain in effect for 2026-35.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, in other words, claims the power to levy trillions of dollars worth of new taxes without seeking new legislation from Congress.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second case is <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/department-of-state-v-aids-vaccine-advocacy-coalition-2/"><em>Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition</em></a>, which is currently pending on the Court’s “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/11/21356913/supreme-court-shadow-docket-jail-asylum-covid-immigrants-sonia-sotomayor-barnes-ahlman">shadow docket</a>,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the Court often decides without explanation. <em>AIDS Vaccine</em> involves “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/401838/supreme-court-usaid-impoundment-trump-aids-vaccine">impoundment</a>,” a president’s refusal to spend money that he is required to spend under a federal appropriations law.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Until very recently, there was widespread consensus that impoundment is illegal. In a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/147706/dl?inline=">1969 Justice Department memo</a>, future Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that “it is in our view extremely difficult to formulate a constitutional theory to justify a refusal by the President to comply with a congressional directive to spend.” And even some members of the current Court’s Republican majority have <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/397820/supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh-trump-spending-freeze-impoundment">expressed skepticism about impoundment in the past</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, in an ominous sign that this Court may allow Trump to impound funds anyway, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a brief order last week <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/090925zr_6j37.pdf">permitting Trump to temporarily impound foreign aid funds</a> while the Court considers the <em>AIDS Vaccine</em> case.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The final case is <em>Trump v. Cook</em>, which is likely to reach the Supreme Court as soon as Tuesday. <em>Cook</em> involves Trump’s attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, in violation of a federal statute which only allows Fed governors to be fired “<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461604/supreme-court-lisa-cook-trump-federal-reserve">for cause</a>.” Late on Monday, a federal appeals court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-appeals-court-rejects-trump-bid-oust-feds-lisa-cook-2025-09-16/">denied Trump this power</a> — although it did so over the dissent of a judge who previously worked in Trump’s White House.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Fed wields tremendous power over the US economy, including the power to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461604/supreme-court-lisa-cook-trump-federal-reserve">temporarily stimulate the economy</a> at the expense of much greater economic turmoil down the road. For this reason, Congress insulated the Fed’s leaders from presidential control to prevent presidents from injecting cocaine into the economy at politically advantageous moments. If Trump gains the power to fire Fed governors, however, that insulation will end.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, in other words, seeks total control over US monetary policy. He seeks the power to cancel federal grants or even eliminate entire federal programs at will. And he claims the power to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes by his mere decree.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Pretty much the only fiscal power Trump hasn’t claimed yet is the power to actually appropriate federal money &#8211; that is, the power to spend however he chooses. The Constitution provides that “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-9/clause-7/appropriations-clause">but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law</a>,” meaning that it is unconstitutional for Trump to spend federal money unless that spending is allowed by an Act of Congress.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, however, if the Supreme Court gives Trump the other powers he is seeking, it would be child’s play for him to get around the Constitution’s Appropriations Clause. The mechanism that prevents federal officials from illegally spending money is the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law/resources">Antideficiency Act</a>, which makes it a crime for federal employees to spend money in excess of the amount appropriated by Congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump can pardon anyone who violates this criminal law. And the Republican justices already held, in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> (2024), that Trump is immune from prosecution if he uses his official powers to commit crimes.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If Trump gets what he wants from the Supreme Court, in other words, he could wind up with dictatorial authority over US fiscal and monetary policy — fully empowered to tax and spend without any meaningful checks from the other branches of government. And there is a real risk that this Court, which has a Republican supermajority that has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/460270/supreme-court-republican-partisan-hacks-donald-trump">shown extraordinary deference to the leader of their political party</a>, will give Trump what he wants.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump claims the power to raise trillions in new taxes — <em>Trump v. V.O.S. Selections</em></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The power to tax is potentially the most frightful power that any government possesses. It is essentially the power to take the fruits of people’s labor and to spend that money on programs of the government’s own choosing.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Which isn’t to say that taxation is wrong. Taxes fund essential humanitarian services, such as Medicare or Medicaid. But they can also fund armies of conquest. Or a secret police directed at a nation’s own citizens.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, the United States has prevented its taxing power from becoming a tool of tyranny by <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/">vesting this power in an elected Congress</a>. The Constitution provides that “Congress,” and not the president, “shall have the Power to lay and collect Taxes.” As mentioned above, it also requires Congress to determine how this money will be spent — although Congress does often enact broad appropriation bills and leave the details of how to spend that money to the Executive.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>V.O.S. Selections</em>, however, Trump claims the power to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/460312/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-vos-selections">raise trillions of dollars worth of new taxes</a> without first seeking Congress’s permission to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In fairness, Trump’s lawyers do argue that he has levied these taxes pursuant to an existing federal law — the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/110th-congress/senate-report/82">International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977</a> (IEEPA), which permits the president to “regulate…transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” Notably, however, IEEPA only permits the president to use this power “to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But multiple federal judges have <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/414794/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-vos-selections-oregon">now ruled</a> that this law does not permit the massive tariffs imposed by Trump. One argument is that the power to “regulate” imports does not include the power to tax them. Other judges have pointed out that Trump has not actually identified an “unusual or extraordinary threat” that can justify the taxes.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, during the Obama and Biden administrations, the Republican justices invented something called the “major questions doctrine,” which is supposed to prevent the executive from enacting new policies of “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/460312/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-vos-selections">vast ‘economic and political significance.’</a>” The legal basis for this brand-new doctrine is dubious, and the Court has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">only actually ever applied it to one president:  President Joe Biden</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But courts are supposed to apply the same rules to Republican presidents that they apply to Democrats. And it should go without saying that the president’s decision to raise trillions of dollars worth of new taxes is a matter of vast economic and political significance.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, given this Court’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/460270/supreme-court-republican-partisan-hacks-donald-trump">sycophantic treatment of Trump</a>, it is far from clear that the Republican justices will apply the same rules to him that they applied to Biden.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump claims the power to unilaterally repeal federal spending laws — <em>State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition</em></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>AIDS Vaccine </em>involves a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/401838/supreme-court-usaid-impoundment-trump-aids-vaccine">long-simmering dispute</a> over whether Trump can cancel about $4 billion in foreign aid funding that he is required to spend under federal law. There is no serious case that he has the power to do this under the Constitution. As Rehnquist wrote in his 1969 memo, it is “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/401838/supreme-court-usaid-impoundment-trump-aids-vaccine">extremely difficult</a>” to even come up with an argument for this position.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, Trump claims to have discovered a loophole that will permit him to impound these funds regardless. The law at issue in <em>AIDS Vaccine </em>requires the government to commit to spending the $4 billion <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/09/groups-urge-supreme-court-to-direct-trump-administration-to-spend-billions-of-withheld-foreign-aid-funds/">by September 30</a>. A separate law, known as the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), permits Trump to ask Congress to repeal his legal obligation to spend the money, and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/683">gives Congress 45 days to decide</a> whether to agree to do so.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So Trump waited until less than 45 days remained before the September 30 deadline and submitted his request to Congress. His lawyers argue that his obligation to spend the money is suspended while Congress considers his request. And then the spending obligation will expire on September 30, and Trump will no longer be legally required to spend the money.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It gets worse. Trump claims that, under the ICA, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25A269/373945/20250908080903468_GHC_Application_9.8_Final.pdf">only the Comptroller General of the United States</a>, who is not a party to the <em>AIDS Vaccine</em> suit, is allowed to sue over illegal impoundments. But this argument is obviously wrong. The ICA <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/681">states explicitly</a> that “nothing contained in this Act…shall be construed as…affecting in any way the claims or defenses of any party to litigation concerning any impoundment.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also serious procedural problems with Trump’s case. Among other things, the ICA requires Trump to transmit his request that Congress repeal his obligation to spend funds “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/685">to the House of Representatives and the Senate on the same day</a>.” But, according to the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25A269/374546/20250912155334013_25A269%20Opp%20to%20Stay%20Application.pdf"><em>AIDS Vaccine</em> plaintiffs’ brief</a>, Trump transmitted his request to the House on August 28, but didn’t send it to the Senate until September 8.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If that’s right, it could nullify Trump’s entire argument. Even if Trump is correct that he can delay the obligation to spend funds by 45 days by submitting a request to Congress, he didn’t properly submit a request to Congress. And thus the obligation is not delayed.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s arguments for impoundment, in other words, are quite weak. If this Supreme Court does accept them, that’s a worrisome sign that they will not prevent him from making future illegal impoundments of federal funds.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Presidential control of the Federal Reserve<em> </em>— <em>Trump v. Cook</em></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, there’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461604/supreme-court-lisa-cook-trump-federal-reserve">Trump’s attempt to fire Lisa Cook</a>, a Biden appointee to the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. By law, Fed governors serve 14-year terms, and can only be removed by the president “for cause.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump claims that he is allowed to fire Cook because she allegedly committed mortgage fraud by declaring two separate properties as her principal residence. But this allegation appears to be false. Reuters reports that Cook declared one of those properties as a “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fed-governor-cook-declared-her-atlanta-property-vacation-home-documents-show-2025-09-13/">vacation home</a>,” and the lender was aware it was not her primary home.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want to know the legal details of this case, I’ll refer you to an explainer I <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461604/supreme-court-lisa-cook-trump-federal-reserve">recently published about it here</a>. The short of it is that the Republican justices have been expanding the president’s power to fire federal officials who are protected from political firings by law, but they indicated in a May decision that Federal Reserve’s leaders remain protected.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, if Trump gains the power to remove Fed leaders who do not comply with his wishes, the consequences could be catastrophic. Prior to his 1972 reelection bid, President Richard Nixon successfully pressured Fed chair Arthur Burns to lower interest rates. The economy briefly took off, and Nixon won in a historic landslide. But Burns’s capitulation is often blamed for years of “stagflation,” slow economic growth and high inflation, during the 1970s.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not hard to imagine how Trump could use the power to boost the economy at politically advantageous moments if he were given the power to do so.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even more significantly, if the Supreme Court were to give Trump full control over the Fed, after it reaffirmed the Fed’s independence as recently as last May, that would eviscerate the Court’s own credibility. And it would suggest that the Court&#8217;s Republican majority will not impose any limits whatsoever on a president of their own party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-set-fight-health-care-government-shutdown-looms/story?id=125510403">announced</a> that Democrats would be seeking a restoration in funding to Medicare and to extend Obamacare subsidies in the upcoming government funding bill. If Republicans refuse to come to the table, Sen. Schumer says Democrats will <a href="https://apnews.com/article/schumer-government-shutdown-budget-democrats-deadline-a0a24afe93f4a1d596fdf9093db58e3d">withhold their votes</a>, forcing a government shutdown at the end of the month. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Days before Schumer’s announcement, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at an event in Utah. In the aftermath, President Donald Trump and his allies <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461254/charlie-kirk-shooting-trump-radical-left-violence">laid blame</a> at the feet of Democrats and <a href="https://time.com/7316315/republicans-far-right-reacts-charlie-kirk-death-blame-left-crackdown/">the left.</a> In a speech from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461314/charlie-kirk-death-trump-political-violence-source">vowed</a> that his administration would “find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it.” Some are arguing that in the midst of this heightened rhetoric, picking a fight over the budget could give Trump license to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461357/charlie-kirk-government-shutdown-filibuster-ezra-klein">further</a> his authoritarian aims. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland thinks it’s worth the risk. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In an interview with <em>Today, Explained</em>, Van Hollen said “there are always risks, but again, it&#8217;s Republicans and the Trump White House that will be taking this risk, because they will clearly be seen to be going it alone, trying to essentially impose total one-party rule on the country.” Van Hollen believes that the Republicans have more to lose by withholding concessions than the Democrats do by holding the line.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of Van Hollen’s conversation with <em>Today, Explained</em> host Noel King, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140">Pandora</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A">Spotify</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Schumer and minority leader Hakeem Jeffries have set their terms for avoiding a government shutdown. They want Republicans to reverse Medicaid cuts and to extend the Obamacare subsidies. What&#8217;s your position on a shutdown?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, first and foremost, we should not be giving President Trump a blank check to continue his lawless activities, including his illegal withholding of funds from — for example, NIH [the National Institutes of Health], where people are undergoing clinical trials for cancer — and he&#8217;s withholding funds that could literally mean a death sentence for them. And the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has found that he is illegally impounding, withholding these funds. And so, we can&#8217;t give them a blank check without guardrails and safeguards to make sure that that won&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do guardrails and safeguards look like? What specifically are you after here?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So, for example, the Republicans in the Senate and the House voted for this so-called rescission package, meaning that they voted to undo resources, appropriations that they previously voted for. You can make that much harder to do by requiring, for example, a 60-vote margin to pass it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can also do other things, Noel. For example, if the president were to engage in an illegal rescission, you could have an across the board immediate cut in White House appropriations. So, there are things you can do if Republicans were willing to join us, but so far, they&#8217;re not willing to take on President Trump in any way.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The country was in a very similar position back in March of this year. And the concern back then was that, if Democrats shut down the government, they would end up taking the blame. They would end up alienating voters. Is that a concern this time around?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, this would be the Trump administration and Republicans in the Congress shutting down the government, because they decide to go it alone. They decide to have a one-way street. They decide to give President Trump a blank check for his lawless activity. And I don&#8217;t think the American people want to see President Trump get a total blank check, because they&#8217;ve seen that he&#8217;s withholding monies from things like FEMA and places that have been hit by disasters and refuse to provide funding for disaster relief. He&#8217;s withholding funds from the National Institutes of Health. In fact, by our calculation right now, they&#8217;re withholding about $400 billion of funds for important priorities for the current fiscal year we&#8217;re in, which ends in just a few weeks. So, if they&#8217;re doing that now, he will do it again unless we stop it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In the first half of the show, our colleague Andrew Prokop proposed this as one possible scenario: An extended shutdown leads Republicans to believe that Democrats are abusing the filibuster, and so they end the filibuster. And so, that means that Republicans no longer need any Democrats to vote with them, and they can do whatever they want. He&#8217;s painting the shutdown as quite a dangerous possibility for Democrats. What do you think about that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are always risks, but again, it&#8217;s Republicans and the Trump White House that will be taking this risk, because they will clearly be seen to be going it alone, trying to essentially impose total one-party rule on the country. Trump&#8217;s sort of authoritarian impulses would have no checks and no balances on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">With respect to Republicans getting rid of the filibuster, I think they recognize that more democracy in the Senate and the House does not favor them in the long run. I mean, I&#8217;ve been an advocate for ending what&#8217;s called the supermajority requirement to end a filibuster; you would still have ample debate for weeks or months, but at the end of the day, you would bring debate to a close with 51 votes. Republicans have been able to do what they want without doing that. So, for example, they use the reconciliation process to pass big tax cuts for the very rich and cut programs for working Americans. We saw them do this in the so-called “big, beautiful bill,” which is beautiful if you&#8217;re a billionaire but stinks for everybody else. So, the big things Republicans like to do, like tax cuts, they get to do even with the filibuster in place. I don&#8217;t think the Republicans will go down that road, because the supermajority requirement [that currently exists] to end a filibuster favors their agenda, not the people&#8217;s agenda.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>After the conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was killed by a shooter last week, President Trump in a speech from the Oval Office blamed, quote, “the radical left.” He vowed to, quote, “find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it.”&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>This strikes people as a potentially very concerning threat to free speech, civil liberties. Have the events of the past week changed your mind at all about how you approach the Trump administration? What do you think the president is saying here?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m very, very alarmed by what the president&#8217;s saying. There&#8217;s no room for political violence in our discourse. We can have robust debates without it veering into violence, and there should be no vengeance. President Trump had a chance to bring the country together to say that political violence is unacceptable regardless of its source, but instead, he&#8217;s decided to engage in finger pointing. Instead, he is weaponizing this awful tragedy, this murder, to advance his political goals, which include going after what he calls folks on the left, which, in Trump world, means anybody who disagrees with Donald Trump. So yes, it&#8217;s very concerning that he would threaten to use the full power and instruments of the federal government to literally go after people who disagree with him.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There is a lot at stake for Democrats here. As you&#8217;ve been saying, polling shows that Americans are really displeased with the party and not just the general public. Democrats themselves are not happy with the party. In August, an Associated Press poll of Democrats saw people using words like “weak,” “tepid,” “ineffective,” and “broken” to describe their own party. What do you think is going on here?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I don&#8217;t think the Democrats have done enough to stand up to Donald Trump&#8217;s lawlessness, nor do I think Democrats have done enough to put forward our own positive vision of what we would do, including taking on very powerful special interests and fighting instead for the common good and the public interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I was invited just over the weekend to speak to the Polk County, Iowa, Democratic Party, and I laid out exactly that argument: that more needs to be done to stand up to Donald Trump in this moment. But clearly in 2024, the American people, the majority of the American people, did not trust us to take on the status quo and take on these special interests. And so, I believe we need to be much more clear not only about what we&#8217;re fighting against, but what we are fighting for.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>At that event on Saturday, you also endorsed Zohran Mamdani. You criticized other Democratic leaders for delaying on endorsing him. You referred to something that you called “spineless politics.” What&#8217;s going on? What&#8217;s Mamdani doing that you like?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What I said was, as we prepare to try to win majorities in the House and the Senate in 2026, we need to first win the 2025 races. We have big races in Virginia and New Jersey for the governor seats, great candidates, and we also need to win the mayoral race in New York City. I pointed out that Donald Trump has spent a huge amount of time and resources trying to defeat Mamdani. Mamdani’s platform was people who work in New York should be able to afford to live in New York, which would be good for people in New York City; and Des Moines, Iowa; and in Maryland; and throughout the country. And yet, you have these very powerful big money, special interests — financial interests combining with Donald Trump to try to defeat Mamdani. And so, I do think this is a moment where Democrats need to stand up for the person who is fighting to reduce costs and make sure that people can afford to live where they work.</p>

Free speech is the foundation of democracy. It’s the lifeblood of a liberal society. Saying what you want to say, what you need to say, is the top spot in the bill of rights for a reason, right? But speech is also powerful. And slippery. And people can use it in dangerous, unpredictable, chaotic ways. [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Free speech is the foundation of democracy. It’s the lifeblood of a liberal society. Saying what you want to say, what you need to say, is the top spot in the bill of rights for a reason, right?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But speech is also powerful. And slippery. And people can use it in dangerous, unpredictable, chaotic ways. So how do we manage that tension? Should free speech be a little less free? Or is it truly an unimpeachable right?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The dangers and virtues of free speech have gained new relevance after the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. He has been praised in death by those on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/charlie-kirk-memorialized-dozens-house-lawmakers-condemning-political-violence">the right</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html">beyond</a> as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5503033-mark-kelly-charlie-kirk-free-speech/">an exemplar</a> of free speech — debating his ideological foes on college campuses and speaking his mind on his podcast.

<p class="has-text-align-none">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="250" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP7916640155&#038;light=true" width="100%"></iframe>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I want to start with the myth of free speech. Most people treat it as a timeless, universal, almost sacred ideal. Your book takes a hammer to that. Why did you think it was important to challenge that story?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Because it’s central to modern culture and because the way we talk about it is often wrong. We all believe in freedom of expression, and rightly so. But two things get missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, psychologically, no one likes being told what to say or not to say. That instinct is powerful. Second, we misunderstand free speech if we try to define it purely from first principles — philosophical or judicial. You can’t really grasp it without history.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A decade ago, I toured with a previous book on the history of sex. I saw how differently people could — or couldn’t — speak about it in different cultures. In China, where it was translated, the text itself was censored; I saw up close how comprehensive the censorship apparatus is. That trip made me ask: If we in the West value free expression so deeply, where does that idea come from? Why do we disagree so sharply about what it means? Those are historical questions, so that’s where I went.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>If you asked most people to define free speech, they’d say it’s the absence of censorship. Simple and clean. What’s wrong with that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s seductive and incomplete. We presume that if you remove censorship, you automatically expand freedom. But freedom of speech has a shape: It’s about <em>who</em> is speaking, <em>to whom</em>, and <em>in what context</em>. Some people’s freedom is greater than others, even within the same society. Historically, for example, women’s voices were less likely to be taken seriously than men’s. That’s not solved by simply abolishing a censor’s office. Power and context still shape expression.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Part of your argument is that free speech has never been a coherent ideal — and it can’t be — because it denies two basic facts about communication: speech is an action in the world, and it’s context-dependent. Can you lay that out?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Speech <em>is</em> an action. Voltaire once wrote to a friend, “I write in order to act.” We speak and publish to have effects in the world. Free speech doctrine — especially in its hardest American form — pretends there’s a neat line between speech and action. That’s just not true. Speech is a particular kind of action. Often it’s trivial, but it can be consequential.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And communication is exquisitely context-dependent. Meaning changes depending on who speaks, where, why, and to whom. A president’s remarks on television aren’t the same as a late-night bar conversation. A joke about a sensitive topic lands differently depending on the speaker and the audience. A content-only approach — “the right to say X words” — ignores the reality that those same words can mean very different things in different contexts.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Many people call themselves free speech absolutists. To be one, do you have to deny those realities?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re an absolutist, you’re forced to wave away questions of harm and context. And there’s a further point: because speech is action, it can be harmful to individuals and to the public good. Defamation can destroy reputations and livelihoods. Conspiracy theories can wreck public discourse and incite violence. Societies have always known this and regulated speech accordingly.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Absolutism feels virtuous — you’re for freedom and against censorship. But it also spares you the hard thinking about the real effects of communication. In practice, nobody is truly absolutist. Even the most libertarian judges in US history have drawn lines about disrupting a courtroom, about targeted harassment, about time, place, and manner. Everyone balances, whether they admit it or not.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The hard question is where to draw the line between offense and harm. Offense has to be permitted in a free society. Harm is trickier, and that border will always be contested.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes. We’re always balancing on slippery slopes. That’s what living in a free, democratic society means. The boundaries should be as capacious as possible, and “harm” should be defined narrowly. Laws are blunt tools; they can’t capture the nuance of communication and are easily weaponized.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But one way to be less confused is to distinguish <em>kinds</em> of expression. Artistic expression should get the broadest latitude: offense isn’t harm, and literal truth isn’t the point. Political speech is different. Truth matters in democratic discourse. If we allow conspiracy and intentional falsehood to swamp the public sphere without guardrails, democracy corrodes. Different arenas call for different considerations.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It’s striking how people’s views on “harmful speech” map onto their place in the power hierarchy. The movement that shouts “free speech” when it’s out of power often suppresses it when it’s in power.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s perennial. “Free speech” has always been a weaponized slogan. It’s invoked to advance whatever one’s current political aims happen to be. That hypocrisy isn’t new; it’s built into the incoherence of the slogan.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Let’s talk about amplification. Not just the right to speak, but the power to be heard. Is that a form of power?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Absolutely. And it’s the missing piece in most modern debates. We tend to imagine free speech as a duel between an individual speaker and the state. We ignore the media — the institutions that amplify or muffle voices. In the 19th century, people already saw that mass media shape whose voices are heard and what counts as legitimate opinion. Their incentives — profit, political influence — often run against truth-seeking.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, online platforms play that role. Their algorithms constantly elevate some speech and bury other speech. If free speech aims to advance truth and enable an equitable public sphere, then the power of amplification has to be part of the equation.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Before the First Amendment, was free speech ever treated as an inherent, fundamental, </strong><strong><em>limitless</em></strong><strong> right?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">No. Before the 18th century, the focus was on limiting the harms of expression — to individuals and to the community. People had learned from grim experience that unpoliced rumor and falsehood lead to riots, pogroms, and chaos. The English-speaking world passed its first <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=301">law against “false news” in 1275</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Modern “liberty of the press” emerges in early 18th-century England for contingent reasons. Prepublication censorship lapses; print explodes; parties use newspapers as weapons. The slogan “liberty of the press” catches on, but it’s always paired with anxiety about “licentiousness” and abuses of liberty. No one believed the right was absolute.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Most Americans have never heard of </strong><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/catos-letters-300-years"><strong><em>Cato’s Letters</em></strong></a><strong>, yet you argue they’re foundational to our tradition. What were they?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A weekly column that ran in London starting in 1721, written by two anonymous journalists. Much of it recycled republican theory — Locke, Machiavelli — into bite-sized attacks on the government. But in the middle of this very derivative project was something strikingly original: a proto-absolutist theory of free speech. They argued that free speech is the most fundamental right; any restriction is a slide into tyranny; and speech can’t cause real harm compared to the harms of censorship.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It was tailor-made for colonial America. The rhetoric suited revolutionaries who wanted to portray imperial authorities as tyrants. The ideas from <em>Cato’s Letters</em> flowed into American pamphlets and, ultimately, the First Amendment’s rhetoric.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And your research suggests the authors weren’t exactly disinterested philosophers.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Far from it. The text doubled as a defense of their own partisan practices. They denounced corruption while participating in it — switching sides for money, seeking government patronage. One of the authors even became a government propagandist. The irony is that their simplistic theory outlived the grubby reality that produced it, crossing the Atlantic and lodging in American political culture.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>John Stuart Mill is the modern giant here. What’s his role?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Mill’s <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm"><em>On Liberty</em></a> is a landmark and remains inspiring, and his defense of “experiments in living” is profound. But as a theory of speech, it’s less coherent than people remember. He grounds free expression in individual self-realization and treats speech as so akin to thought that it’s nearly immune from scrutiny. That elides the fact that expression <em>does</em> affect others; that’s the point of expression.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also the imperial context. Mill spent his career as a senior official of the British Empire in India. He explicitly limits his ideal of near-limitless expression to “advanced” civilizations. For “lesser” ones, he thinks the risks of harm are too great. His critics at the time called this out. We remember Mill’s gorgeous rhetoric; we forget the caveats that undermine it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Then there’s the “marketplace of ideas.” If we just get out of the way and let speech collide, truth will win. Is this a metaphor you’d like to kill?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I understand the appeal; I wish it were true. But a genuine marketplace of ideas would require equal access to truthful information, shared norms about evidence, and roughly equal ability to participate. That’s the opposite of our current media environment.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There <em>are</em> institutions that try to approximate a truth-seeking marketplace: scholarship, serious journalism, high-standard publishing. They have guardrails — fact-checking, peer review, professional norms — and over time they do converge on truth. The scientific consensus on climate change is a good example. But in the wider political sphere, “marketplace” is a fig leaf for the elevation of spectacle, grievance, and profitable falsehood.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is the American approach exceptional now?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, <em>now</em>. One of the surprises of my research is that from the late 18th century through the 1940s, American practice wasn’t so different from Europe’s. There was a balancing model:&nbsp; freedom paired with responsibility and an acknowledgment of potential harms. In 1789, just weeks after the First Amendment text was agreed, news of the French <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man</em> reached America. It enshrined freedom of expression <em>and</em> the responsibility not to abuse it. American commentators praised that formulation as superior. Pennsylvania promptly adopted that balancing language in its state constitution, and other states followed.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What changed was the Cold War. In a struggle against totalitarianism, Americans recoiled from anything that sounded like “collective” thinking. The Supreme Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence swerved toward a harder, more absolutist line. Noble intentions — simplifying doctrine, protecting dissidents — had unintended effects: widening the gap between legal theory and communicative reality and opening the door to legally protected harms in the public sphere.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>To defend the First Amendment for a moment: It’s been a crucial safeguard against state overreach, protecting dissidents and civil rights leaders. I’d rather live with the chaos of too much speech than the dangers of too little. But I admit that the digital era has made me less certain.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Both models — absolutist and balancing — have flaws. The difficulty with the contemporary American version is that it refuses to grapple with speech as action and with amplification power. That refusal has been embraced by corporations that govern online discourse globally.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We should also stop pretending platforms are neutral conduits. Their algorithms <em>are</em> constant moderation for profit. Historically, every new mass medium — radio, television, film — came with public-interest regulation. In the 1990s, the U.S. took a different path for the internet. <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/28/21273241/section-230-explained-supreme-court-social-media">Section 230</a> gave platforms sweeping protection: They can moderate and also avoid responsibility for what they publish. Combine that with “more speech is the only answer,” and you have a recipe for irresponsibility at scale.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And the standard worry: Do we really want platforms — or governments — deciding what counts as acceptable speech?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a fair worry, but “do nothing” isn’t a solution. The most sophisticated attempts so far are in the European Union. The basic model there is to create independent, arms-length oversight bodies — nonpartisan, public-interest oriented. Then require transparency: What are your rules, and are you applying them consistently? No more black boxes. And then scale obligations to power. A tiny startup shouldn’t face the same burden as a trillion-dollar platform that can afford robust moderation and has global impact. If you profit from shaping the public sphere, you inherit responsibilities to it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So what now? Do we need to stop treating free speech as a fixed, universal ideal to be perfectly realized and instead see it more clearly as a political tool — one we adapt to our ends?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We need to get more sophisticated. We’re living through a global media revolution; the old rules don’t fit, and that’s why the topic is so hot again. The way we talk about free speech is too simple. We ignore amplification. We collapse distinct spheres — art, scholarship, politics — into one undifferentiated debate. We pretend the ideal has no shape, when in fact it’s always about power: who gets heard; who doesn’t.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We won’t agree on everything. But we can have better arguments if we use better concepts. That’s what I hope the book offers.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>However messy it is, the ideal still seems worth defending. I certainly believe that, and I think you do too. No one here is anti–free speech.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course. It’s a noble ideal and essential to a free society. But we should always ask: <em>What is the speech for?</em> For art, the aim is imagination — shock, delight, provocation. For democratic discourse, the aim is self-government. There, we have to take the problem of harm seriously — not just the American, very narrow standard of immediate incitement, but the broader, historically well-known ways in which speech can corrupt the public sphere and strip people of equal dignity.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What about the press? What’s our responsibility in a free society?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1940s and after, as people thought seriously about media power, the American response — short of formal legislation — was professionalization: journalism schools, editorial standards, error correction. Those norms, however imperfect, tried to align media power with the public good. If we lose that, we regress to a world of pure rumor and propaganda.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And yes, commercialization distorts incentives. The “capitalist press,” as early socialists sneered, often serves profit before truth. That tension is real, and it matters.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>If I put a map in front of you and asked you to point to the country managing all this best, could you?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">No. Not the US. Not Britain. Not India. Every system is struggling, which may just reflect the messiness of human communication. We’re also still in the early stages of the most significant communications revolution since print — maybe bigger. Renegotiating the boundaries of speech and power will take time. Let’s hope we sort it out before the lights go out.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Anything you want to leave people with?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The next time you see a “free speech” crisis and feel the urge to pick a side instantly, pause and ask: What is this slogan being <em>used</em> to do? What is it concealing? Often “free speech” short-circuits a deeper political debate we ought to have. Don’t let the slogan preempt the substance.</p>
