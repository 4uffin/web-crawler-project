<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Welcome to The Logoff:</strong> The Trump administration is leaning into its attack on free speech after pressuring ABC to take late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What happened?</strong> Kimmel was suspended by ABC on Wednesday after comments from President Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a podcast appearance Wednesday, Carr said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Subsequently, two major broadcast groups announced their intent to pull Kimmel’s show from local stations; Nexstar, one of those groups, needs FCC approval for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/business/media/nexstar-tegna-deal.html">pending merger</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What did Kimmel say?</strong> Ostensibly, Kimmel’s suspension was over arguably misleading but relatively anodyne <a href="https://x.com/jason_kint/status/1968456521353756883">remarks</a> he made about the death of Charlie Kirk earlier this week. On Thursday, however, Trump gave away the game, <a href="https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1968739210376134781">telling reporters</a> that, “When you have a network and you have evening shows and all they do is hit Trump…They’re not allowed to do that.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> Under the First Amendment, the government cannot suppress speech, no matter how much it might disagree with it. Kimmel’s suspension didn’t require any concrete action by the FCC, but it clearly came in response to Carr’s comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr also said Thursday that “I don’t think this is the last shoe to drop…the consequences are going to continue to flow.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the big picture?</strong> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjhoMGxra29nNmkiLCJwIjoiL3BvbGl0aWNzLzQ2MTg4Ny9qaW1teS1raW1tZWwtc3VzcGVuc2lvbi1haXItYWJjLWNoYXJsaWUta2lyay1uZXhzdGFyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5MzczNTQzLCJpYXQiOjE3NTgxNjM5NDN9.YM3GMYWJWySd9trlimPmYwiNoO-8KQ_Sth7eMJ9pICM&amp;utm_medium=gift-link&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_campaign=SSSCOTUSTrumpsTeam&amp;ueid=10b3a670165430d31fdd98f5af631883&amp;utm_term=Highly%20engaged%20non-contribs">As my colleague Zack Beauchamp has written</a>, this is Trump’s most brazen attack on free speech yet, and right out of a familiar autocratic playbook. Trump has a long way to go before he achieves a level of media control like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán — but the speed with which he was able to get Kimmel suspended is a concerning sign. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the fatal shooting of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461408/charlie-kirk-shooting-killed-right-way-suspect">conservative influencer Charlie Kirk</a> last week, observers rushed to take part in what’s become one of America’s most gruesome past times: waiting to figure out the politics of the shooter, so blame could be assigned to one party or the other for the tragedy.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservative politicians hurried to identify the shooter as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5499567-reporter-mace-democrats-kirk-killing/">a far-left Democrat</a>. After Tyler Robinson was arrested for the shooting, left-wing commenters circulated unfounded theories that Robinson might be a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/15/groyper-charlie-kirk-nick-fuentes-tyler-robinson">Groyper</a>, a white supremacist who thought Kirk’s racism didn’t go far enough. The war over Robinson&#8217;s identity reached a crescendo with <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/461948/jimmy-kimmel-pulled-trump-fcc-charlie-kirk">Jimmy Kimmel&#8217;s suspension</a>, after the late-night host seemed to imply Robinson was a MAGA supporter in a monologue Monday night. Meanwhile, the right, starting with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, has sought to spin Kirk’s killing into a larger narrative about the left’s propensity for political violence, a claim that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461314/charlie-kirk-death-trump-political-violence-source">isn’t backed by evidence</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, as Arie Perliger, a professor of criminology at UMass Lowell who has studied hundreds of political assassinations from the past century, has found, political violence is a much more complicated phenomenon than the current discourse would have us believe. “Each side picks the details that fit their own narratives, right?” he told Vox in a video interview.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And a closer look at assassinations reveals that the reasons for them run the gamut. For every assassin <a href="https://scout.lib.utk.edu/repositories/2/resources/1860">guided by a clearly comprehensive ideology of hatred and bigotry</a>, there’s one who thinks <a href="https://lblandmark.org/who-were-the-assassins-john-hinckley-jr-and-samuel-byck/">assassinating a US president will help him impress an actor</a> (Ronald Reagan and Jodie Foster, respectively). Thomas Matthew Crook, who shot at Donald Trump during a campaign event last summer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/us/thomas-crooks-trump-shooter-butler-rally.html">was a registered Republican who also donated to Joe Biden’s campaign</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Perliger thinks that when we endlessly obsess over the individual politics of an assassin, we’re focusing on the wrong question.&nbsp; “I think that we can learn much more about the overall conditions that facilitate people like Tyler Robinson,” he said. Those conditions, per Perliger’s research, include political polarization and endemic dysfunction —&nbsp;two qualities the US government has in spades right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can read highlights from my conversation with Perliger below. They’ve been lightly edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Give me a quick overview of some of the research you&#8217;ve done on assassins.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ten years ago, when I was faculty at West Point, we compiled a data set of around 700 political assassinations — not just of elected officials, but also judges and some other political figures.&nbsp; We tried to really understand if we could identify some patterns, some similarities, and if you could produce some kind of insights about the factors that can facilitate political assassinations.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Political assassination is perceived as a very quick shock to the system. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What we were able to find out is that political assassinations are a combination of two factors. First of all, there’s increasing political polarization and the overlap of different societal cleavages. The second thing is that in many cases, it is being utilized when groups, constituencies, individuals, movements are losing trust in the political system. In other words, they deem the political system as ineffective.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ordinarily, when we want to promote political changes, it demands a lot of resources, time, money, mobilizing the masses, and so on. Political assassination is perceived as a very quick shock to the system that can really dramatically change the political landscape and as a result can help the assassin to promote their objectives, their agenda.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>One of the things that is really striking is how frequently, for a lot of these very famous assassinations, the agenda at hand is hard to understand from the outside. How common is it for assassins to act for political reasons that the rest of us have a lot of trouble parsing?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Our expectation to see someone in his 20s having some kind of a coherent ideological framework — it&#8217;s a bit unrealistic, even if they do extreme acts of violence or any kind of extreme act.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s very difficult to understand how attitudes, emotions, and perceptions intersect to lead a young person to perpetrate [a crime]. This is why I tend to focus more on how the environment leads those individuals or confused individuals, which are very common in that age, to engage in those kinds of acts of violence. I&#8217;m not just talking about political assassination. I&#8217;m talking in general about why we see young people much more comfortable in engaging in different acts of violence or extreme activities, including on campuses. I think that&#8217;s the real question that I&#8217;m trying to answer and to look at in my research.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do political assassins tend to be younger? Is age correlated with assassination in the data set?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not necessarily, actually. Our data set goes back to World War II, and it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that most political action until the early 2000s, most groups that challenged the government or challenged the social order, were very organized. They were actual institutionalized organizations. They actually met with each other. They actually distributed physical texts.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What happened in the last 20 years is that a lot of those movements and a lot of those ideas now are virtual ones, where part of the ethos is direct action: “If you&#8217;re really a believer, you should not expect any kind of organizational support. You should act.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We see that on the environmental side, for example. A lot of environmental groups encourage members to act independently to protest against environmental policy that they don&#8217;t like, and so on. We see that also in the extremities of the left and the right, the idea that, in this day and age, we need to engage in these kinds of little resistances. If you really believe in those goals, in those ideologies, if you are really committed to the cause, you should act based on your own resources, based on your own capabilities. That&#8217;s really the secret sauce that will enable the movement to be more effective and to move forward. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And this is why you see so many lone actors recently, including during assassinations, which is much different than what we&#8217;ve seen in the past.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>One of the things that I&#8217;m interested in is that whenever a tragedy like this occurs, there&#8217;s a rush from observers and politicians and people in the media to try to figure out what side of the political aisle the perpetrator was on, so we can all decide who to blame for what they did. From your perspective, what do you think leads to that impulse? And is there any use to it?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s really funny to see all this cherry-picking. Each side picks the details that fit their own narratives, right? “He talked with his parents about how much he hates Kirk, so he’s on the left. His parents are Republicans, so he actually grew up in a conservative family.” It&#8217;s completely unproductive, and it doesn&#8217;t really tell us anything. In general, I&#8217;m very reluctant to focus on specific individuals. I think that we can learn much more about the overall conditions that facilitate people like Tyler Robinson.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s really funny to see all this cherry-picking. Each side picks the details that fit their own narratives, right? </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that I really emphasize when I&#8217;m being asked about this is the fact that political polarization has created a dysfunctional political system. Politicians today have zero incentives to engage in bipartisan politics. Congress, for a long time, has not actually engaged in policy construction, and cannot really produce any kind of shared politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s this strong sense that the system is delegitimizing the democratic process, and it creates a vacuum where different groups can argue democracy doesn&#8217;t work. “It&#8217;s obvious democracy doesn&#8217;t work. We should engage in other means in order to promote our objectives, whether it&#8217;s engaging in mass disruption, whether it&#8217;s burning everything that we can burn or killing people.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second element is that the incentives to go to the extreme create an ongoing delegitimization and demonizations of political rivals. Every policy that the other side promotes is an existential threat, is a catastrophe coming.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When I was tracking far-right online spaces during the Biden administration, every day they were sure that their constitutional rights were being violated, that their civil liberties were under threat. They were sure that antifa was at the gates. Every policy that Biden promoted was perceived as, “Okay, that&#8217;s the end of America.” In many ways, we see that now.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Look, we can have policy debates, but not every policy is an existential threat to the republic. We need to be able to actually have a discussion that is more nuanced. No wonder that people think that we have to do something, because things are going really, really bad. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The combination of all those things that I&#8217;ve just mentioned has created an environment which normalizes the usage of political violence, normalizes a consistent challenging of the system and the status quo. It’s created a situation where everybody feels that we&#8217;re in a very dark place. That&#8217;s because the mechanism that&#8217;s supposed to overcome those dark places is not really functioning anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of my colleagues don&#8217;t like me saying that. I got tons of emails of all the interviews I did in the last few days: How dare I blame both sides? I blame both sides because I think both sides are engaged in similar rhetorical practices, and both sides are involved in violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It seems like you’re arguing that the political system has become so dysfunctional that a response of nihilism is, in some ways, quite rational. Is that a fair summary?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Definitely. In a different environment, people like Tyler Robinson would find more constructive ways to express their concerns. However, considering all the things that I&#8217;ve just mentioned to you, all those factors that work together, it&#8217;s no wonder that some of those individuals resort to those kinds of actions. It&#8217;s a broader theme that we see about how the entire societal discourse is normalizing these kinds of things. <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/390911/luigi-mangione-uhc-shooter-manifesto-reddit-blackpill">Luigi Mangione</a> became a folk hero in some circles.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s going back to the lack of even basic empathy as human beings, and the fact that ideology basically encompasses everything, that we stop seeing people. We&#8217;re seeing everyone through ideological lenses and ideological prisms. We&#8217;re losing the basic understanding that our discourse would be much better if you maintain some of those aspects of some of those sentiments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m always being asked what&#8217;s the one thing that our leaders can do. I always tell them that they don&#8217;t need to talk. They actually need to engage in bipartisan behavior that will signal to their constituencies that the other side is not necessarily evil. Once you signal to your constituency that it is possible to work with the other side, that&#8217;s a strong enough message to understand that it&#8217;s actually possible to create things together, and not just each side engaging in performative politics that maybe give them some votes from their bases, but doesn&#8217;t really promote anything really constructive.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is there anything we haven’t discussed about this assassination that you think is particularly of note?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s two things that I think are really interesting. First of all, the expansion of political assassinations outside the political system. Charlie Kirk was not an elected official. He was a public speaker, and you can argue he was probably more influential than many other elected officials. That created a different discourse among what we call the influencers on the right and the left. It&#8217;s not just that suddenly they are talking about their own sense of security, but it also shows that politics right now is probably much more combustible outside the institution. It created different dynamics of where politics is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second thing I think is it happened on a university campus. It&#8217;s another reflection of the fact that campuses are becoming spaces for very contentious acts and violent acts. Campuses are less and less becoming places where you can actually engage in intellectual debate and exchange of ideas. Most people on campus these days are reluctant to engage in any kind of political discourse or any kind of issues, because of the potential cost. So we are losing universities as spaces where there&#8217;s actual intellectual debate, and they are becoming more spaces where both sides are doing performative politics, just doing performance, rather than actually talking to each other.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">ABC pulled late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air “indefinitely” Wednesday night following pressure from the Federal Communications Commission over comments Kimmel made on the suspect apprehended for the killing of right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel’s suspension comes after a monologue Monday night in which he said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” Many read this as Kimmel implying that the shooter himself was right-wing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Late-night talk show monologues are supposed to be funny, not rigorous journalism. It’s very unusual for a comedian to be suspended because of one, and it’s clear that Kimmel would not have been suspended if President Donald Trump’s FCC had not put extraordinary pressure on Disney-ABC. (In this case, that pressure was applied via Nexstar Media, the largest owner of TV stations in the US, which announced it would preempt Kimmel’s show. <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nexstar-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-1236522584/">Nexstar is currently awaiting FCC approval for a planned $6.2 billion acquisition</a>.) On Thursday morning, amid mounting outcry over Kimmel’s suspension, it was reported that ABC “<a href="https://x.com/dylanbyers/status/1968485878390550964?s=46">hopes to have the matter resolved and the show return</a>.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole controversy is a shocking turn both in the Trump administration’s escalating war on its critics and in Jimmy Kimmel’s once pointedly apolitical career. Kimmel, after all, has spent most of his career embodying one archetype: regular American straight white dude. What could be more harmless and less controversial than that?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel started his career as a comic and radio host, an approachable everyman. In his first major television role as a host of Comedy Central’s <em>Win Ben Stein’s Money</em> in 1997, he was the audience surrogate, with his schlubby persona and his blue-collar accent an easy balance to Stein’s erudite snobbery. When Kimmel became the co-host of <em>The Man Show</em> in 1999, he was continuing to play the same character, only with the boorishness dialed up: leering at hot girls and circulating petitions to end women’s suffrage. In the raunch-obsessed 2000s, the crassness played as edgy: not politically correct, certainly, but the kind of thing it was assumed any man would probably do, if he could only unleash his id. </p>
<div class="youtube-embed"><iframe title="What Jimmy Kimmel Thinks about Women&#039;s Suffrage" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0TgCgdvJ2c?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel left <em>The Man Show</em> in 2003 to launch <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> on ABC, where he dialed down the ogling but maintained his everyday dude persona. He also stayed away from talking too much politics. In those years when <em>The Daily Show</em> and <em>The Colbert Report</em> were at the height of their power and influence, Kimmel’s biggest running gag was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSfoF6MhgLA&amp;list=PL0DD371FFDFF2057A">mock feud with Matt Damon</a>. Regular guys, after all, are not policy wonks. They like making chill jokes about movie stars.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When the guy from <em>The Man Show</em> becomes Walter Cronkite</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel wouldn’t start to get political in earnest until 2017, when his son was born with a rare congenital heart defect. At the time, a Republican-controlled Congress was pushing to repeal the Affordable Care Act. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/arts/television/jimmy-kimmel-baby-son-wife.html">Kimmel lashed out in a rare emotional monologue</a>. “Before 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you’d never be able to get health insurance because you had a preexisting condition,” Kimmel said, adding through tears. “If your baby is going to die, and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make.”</p>
<div class="youtube-embed"><iframe title="Jimmy Kimmel Reveals Details of His Son’s Birth &amp; Heart Disease" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmWWoMcGmo0?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Later that year, Kimmel was once again in tears over the news. There was a mass shooting in Las Vegas, Kimmel’s hometown. &#8220;It&#8217;s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,&#8221; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/10/03/555318165/watch-jimmy-kimmel-slams-so-called-leaders-on-gun-control">Kimmel said</a>. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why our so-called leaders continue to allow this to happen, or maybe a better question, why do we continue to let them to allow it to happen?&#8221;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">All of a sudden, marveled New York magazine, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-on-healthcare-trump-gun-control.html">Jimmy Kimmel was Walter Cronkite</a>. In an interview, Kimmel noted that his background made it “hit harder” when he talked about politics: “To hear the guy from <em>The Man Show</em>&nbsp;talk about [gay rights] in an inclusive way — I have some credibility,” he allowed. He felt his evolution showed that “the country has come a long way.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel, after all, was the avatar of regular American straight white guys. He was where the mainstream was. In <em>The Man Show</em> days, the implication was that you would have to be a humorless prude not to laugh at the joke if Kimmel was the guy making it. Now, if Kimmel was cool with gay rights and health care and gun control, the implication was that you would have to be a real heartless freak not to agree with him.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel’s liberal turn came with a fair amount of anti-Trump jokes, all of which infuriated Trump. In 2018, in a sign of things to come, Trump reportedly had his administration make repeated calls to executives at ABC parent company Disney, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-white-house-pressure-disney-censor-jimmy-kimmel-1234686853/">telling them to rein Kimmel in</a>. Much to Trump’s displeasure, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jimmy-kimmel-mouth-shut_n_65f7af20e4b030e8357a7d66">Kimmel, if anything, doubled down on his Trump material</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Jimmy Kimmel is — every night, he hits me, I guess. His ratings are terrible,” <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jimmy-kimmel-mouth-shut_n_65f7af20e4b030e8357a7d66">Trump told Fox News in 2024</a>. “He’s not a talented guy.” <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-named-trump-trial_n_6634747ae4b05f96b017e11a">During Trump’s 2024 criminal trial, Kimmel made an unexpected cameo</a>: Prosecutors entered into evidence text messages in which Trump’s lawyers fretted over Trump’s anger when Stormy Daniels appeared on Kimmel’s show. <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/420351/late-show-with-stephen-colbert-cancellation-political-comedy-trump">After CBS fired Stephen Colbert earlier this year</a>, Trump gloated that Kimmel would be next.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Trump has finally managed to accomplish what he wanted to do in 2018. He used government pressure to get Jimmy Kimmel off the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Kimmel’s suspension throws into relief how symbolic he’s become. His evolution from smug post-feminist crassness in the 2000s to a sincere and outraged liberalism during Trump’s first term mirrors the political evolution American pop culture underwent at the same time. Perhaps that’s why, despite how dramatically American culture has shifted since the days of <em>The Man Show</em>, and despite how envelope-pushing his early comedy looks now, Kimmel emerged from the so-called cancel culture moment relatively unscathed. He’s never faced serious career repercussions for people outraged in retrospect by the Juggy Dance Squad or Hot Girls Jumping on Trampolines. In 2020, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/24/882504182/late-night-talk-show-host-jimmy-kimmel-apologizes-for-use-of-blackface">he apologized for having worn blackface in old <em>Man Show</em> episodes</a>, and that was the end of that. People have been more or less willing to take him at his word when he says that his intentions were good and that his outlook has sincerely changed.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, the thing that got Jimmy Kimmel right up to the edge of losing his show is that he said something the president doesn’t like. Kimmel is acting as a mirror yet again, and this time, what he’s showing us is that we are lost in an illiberal moment.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01213-z">commentary paper</a> in the journal <em>Nature Food</em>, some of the worst animal suffering in the world can be prevented at a rate of just a couple of pennies per hour: the extreme pain experienced by chickens raised for meat. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last 75 years, chickens have been bred to grow incredibly large and incredibly fast. Their rapid growth rate has made chicken the most affordable and plentiful meat in the US, where <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">over 9 billion are raised and slaughtered annually</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s come at the cost of making chickens <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/408152/animal-cruelty-factory-farms-chicken-welfare-genetics">suffer terribly</a> throughout their short lives from a range of health and welfare issues, like <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9386003/">heat stress</a>, <a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/poultry/miscellaneous-conditions-of-poultry/ascites-syndrome-in-poultry">heart failure</a>, and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6749567/">lameness</a> — difficulty walking — which can be so severe that chickens die of dehydration or starvation because they can’t even stand and move to get water and food.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s arguably the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/408152/animal-cruelty-factory-farms-chicken-welfare-genetics">largest form of systematized animal cruelty</a> humans have ever invented.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Kenny_Vox_ChickenSize_-3.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="An infographic showing how chickens have been bred to grow larger since 1950.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the scale and cruelty of conventional chicken farming — and other forms of livestock production — animal welfare has largely been left out of food policy discussions. The nonprofit <a href="https://welfarefootprint.org/">Welfare Footprint Institute</a>, composed of a team of animal welfare researchers that led the <em>Nature Food </em>paper, is looking to change that by putting a cost on preventing animal pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The group looks at how animals are bred, the conditions in which they’re raised, and the prevalence and frequency of problems like injury and disease in those systems to determine how many hours of certain types of pain they experience. Scientific research on animal welfare — using behavioral observations, neurophysiological markers, and response to pain-relieving drugs — informs WFI’s work, and the group’s population-level estimates try to account for differences in individual animals’ experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to their research, the average factory-farmed chicken experiences:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>50 hours of “<a href="https://welfarefootprint.org/technical-definitions/pain-intensities/">disabling pain</a>” — pain so severe that it &#8220;significantly limits or prevents normal activities and functioning” — in their lifetime</li>
<li>334 hours of what the researchers call “hurtful pain,” or moderate pain that causes distress</li>
<li>325 hours of “annoying pain,” a mild but distracting discomfort</li>
<li>30 seconds of “excruciating pain,” an “overwhelming pain that dominates” their consciousness </li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s about 700 hours of pain. Considering that chickens raised for meat only live for around 1,100 hours, or 45 days, and sleep for a sizable portion of that, they experience some level of pain for much of their waking life. These painful hours represent a kind of “welfare footprint,” the authors argue.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/WAM35903.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.039032006245115,100,99.92193598751" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A young broiler chicken on an Australian factory farm. | Bear Witness Australia/We Animals" data-portal-copyright="Bear Witness Australia/We Animals" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As consumers, producers, policy-makers, investors and advocates, we are able to easily find out the prices of products, and we now also have carbon footprints to understand environmental impacts,” Kate Hartcher, a senior researcher with WFI and a co-author of the paper, told me over email. “So, why not have the same for animals?”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One simple change, Hartcher and her co-authors argue, can improve the welfare footprint of chicken meat for mere pennies: switching to slower-growing chicken breeds.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Raising chickens slow and fast</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For the last decade, animal welfare groups have campaigned for meat producers and major food brands to adopt what they call the Better Chicken Commitment, a <a href="https://betterchickencommitment.com/us/policy/">slate of reforms</a> including using slower-growing chicken breeds, which are known to have lower rates of lameness, heart and lung disease, heat stress, and other issues. It also calls for other changes, like giving chickens more space and using a more humane slaughter method.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the Welfare Footprint Institute, chickens raised according to these standards suffer about 33 fewer hours of disabling and excruciating pain compared to conventional fast-growing chickens. Poultry companies have resisted calls to switch to slower-growing chicken breeds because they cost more to raise, taking about two weeks longer to reach their lower slaughter weight. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/BvbUD-fast-growing-chickens-suffer-a-lot-more-than-slower-growing-chickens.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A chart showing how fast-growing chickens suffer more hours of pain than slower-growing chickens. " title="A chart showing how fast-growing chickens suffer more hours of pain than slower-growing chickens. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But, according to the Welfare Footprint Institute’s new paper, which was written in conjunction with researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute and the University of Colorado Boulder, the cost is minuscule in terms of how much it costs to prevent pain. Switching to slower-growing breeds, according to their analysis, would prevent at least 15 to 100 hours of disabling and excruciating pain at a rate of 45 cents per pound for producers. (And even that range is a very conservative estimate, Hartcher told me, because it doesn’t account for all of the many serious welfare problems on chicken factory farms.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Put in other words, an hour of these intense forms of pain could be averted at a rate of just half a cent to three cents.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, agricultural economists <a href="https://senciencia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a17ec-jare_slowgrowth_published.pdf">estimated</a> that slower-growing breeds raise production costs by 11 percent to 26 percent and increase wholesale chicken prices by 10 to 36 cents per pound. The switch could moderately raise the price of chicken for consumers but, Hartcher said, “instead of focusing on the ‘costs’ of improving animal welfare, we show that the cost of preventing pain is tiny, and the benefits are enormous.” </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A brutal trade-off</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Chicken Council, the industry’s leading trade group, however, has <a href="https://www.chickencheck.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/environmental-impact-slow-growth-chicken.pdf">argued against using slower-growing breeds</a> — not just on economic grounds, but also on environmental ones. To meet current chicken demand with smaller, slower-growing breeds, the NCC says, the US industry would need to raise a lot more birds — an additional 4.5 billion or so per year, an approximately 50 percent increase. That also means using more land, pesticides, and fertilizer to grow chicken feed, all of which contribute to climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00071668.2024.2432926#d1e1125">generally</a> <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210478">true</a>, even if the National Chicken Council is far from an authority on environmental sustainability (the poultry industry is a major <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/4/20993654/chicken-beef-climate-environment-factory-farms">air and water polluter</a>). The National Chicken Council didn’t respond to a request for comment on the <em>Nature Food</em> paper.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Exactly how much slower-growing breeds increase greenhouse gas emissions is unclear and can vary depending on the specific breed, feed sourcing, and farming practices. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579122004400?via%3Dihub">2022 study</a> found a 16 percent emissions increase, while a <a href="https://corporate.perduefarms.com/pdfs/animal_care_report.pdf">2022 trial</a> by poultry giant Perdue Farms found a 9 percent to 13.4 percent increase. According to a <a href="https://avec-poultry.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/European-Chicken-Commitment-Report-ADAS-March-2024.pdf">European chicken industry group</a>, using slower-growing breeds when paired with other welfare reforms increases the climate footprint of chicken meat by 24 percent.  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever the exact environmental difference, arguing against treating animals better because it would marginally raise climate emissions implies a disturbing position: That raising animals who’ve been bred to suffer terribly is permissible so long as it’s better for the climate. In surveys, consumers say they care <a href="https://climateaction.rutgers.edu/why-health-and-price-not-sustainability-drive-u-s-meat-consumption-choices/">similarly</a> or <a href="https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/84794301/Consumers_across_five_European_countries.pdf">even more</a> about animal welfare than sustainability.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">However, this logic has proven persuasive to influential policymakers, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/422708/future-of-food-abundance-factory-farming-grunwald">environmental researchers</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf">some environmental groups</a>. In 2023, when the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization published a <a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/61c1ab4e-32f7-47c4-b267-d6410bb1dac3/content">road map</a> on how the world can feed a growing population without blowing past climate targets, it wrote that the livestock sector “requires intensified productivity via improved genetics” — in other words, using breeds that make animals grow bigger and faster, and suffer more.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Hartcher said her and her coauthors’ analysis challenges the notion “that the intensification of animal production, including faster growth rates, can be justified by environmental considerations alone, given the disproportionate and severe animal welfare harms and only minimal variations in environmental indicators.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The switch to slower-growing chickens does, however, present a different dilemma for animal advocates: Is it better to farm fewer chickens who are all suffering a lot, or more chickens who are each suffering somewhat less?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, most animal advocates — and some environmentalists, too — try to square the tensions in these trade-offs by recommending that we eat less meat overall and treat each animal better, an approach sometimes called &#8220;<a href="https://www.tabledebates.org/research-library/what-less-better-meat">less but better</a>.&#8221;  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Almost in all of these cases, you&#8217;re never going to land on the optimal thing,” <a href="https://www.sei.org/people/cleo-verkuijl/">Cleo Verkuijl</a>, a senior scientist at the US branch of the Stockholm Environment Institute and a co-author of the <em>Nature Food</em> paper, told me. But now businesses and policymakers can at least account for animal suffering rather than ignore it, and make more reasoned — and hopefully, more humane — decisions.&nbsp;</p>

You might not consider yourself a creative person anymore, but you almost certainly were at one point. Among childhood’s many blessings is the freedom to play and create; art class, recess, and music lessons offer outlets for unbridled imagination and expressiveness.

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might not consider yourself a creative person anymore, but you almost certainly were at one point. Among childhood’s many blessings is the freedom to play and create; art class, recess, and music lessons offer outlets for unbridled imagination and expressiveness. But somewhere along the way, play and creation become uncool, something only little kids do, according to <a href="https://casholman.com/">Cas Holman</a>, a toy designer and author of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/736596/playful-by-cas-holman-with-lydia-denworth/"><em>Playful: How Play Shifts Our Thinking, Inspires Connection, and Sparks Creativity</em></a>. So we stop. We focus on activities we excel in or could make us money instead of ones we enjoy simply for the sake of doing them.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As grown-up responsibilities mount, what limited free time remains might not be dedicated to creative pursuits but to rest, entertainment, doomscrolling. But for all the overwhelm in the world, you might have an itch for a more tactile, creative outlet — one that takes you away from the news, screens, and chaos, and puts you in touch with your more playful side.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not only are these activities enjoyable, but infusing more creativity into your free time might also make you more creative in other domains, too. The unstructured and exploratory thinking fostered by a hobby can bleed into other areas of your life, says <a href="https://www.zorana-ivcevic-pringle.com/">Zorana Ivcevic Pringle</a>, a senior research scientist at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and author of <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-zorana-ivcevic-pringle/the-creativity-choice/9781541704329/"><em>The Creativity Choice: The Science of Making Decisions to Turn Ideas Into Action</em></a><em>.</em> Indulging in that creative curiosity at work, for instance, might breed breakthroughs there, too.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you think the creative part of you is long dormant, it’s possible to foster your more imaginative side. “That play instinct is still there,” Holman says. “We all became who we are through play, and we can still connect to that play from childhood. But also, there is a play inside of us that has evolved with us and will look and feel different than the play did when we were children.” If you’ve been wanting to start some sort of creative practice but have felt stymied, here are three simple tips to help you get started and sustain your new habits.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">1. Tap into your history and interests</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps the greatest threat to any new or reignited creative habit is waning motivation. At the onset of a new venture, <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-025-07733-3">motivation</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcal.12385">is high, but it</a> tapers over time. But doing something you genuinely like (or used to like) makes it <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976251350960">more likely you’ll stick with it.</a> “Whatever makes something more fun for you tends to make you more motivated to keep doing it,” says <a href="https://www.katymilkman.com/">Katy Milkman</a>, Wharton professor and author of <a href="https://www.katymilkman.com/book"><em>How to Change: The Science of Getting From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be</em></a>. “The broad thing we can say from research is, is it fun and alluring, and does it have a hook for you personally? That&#8217;s different for every person.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It can be helpful to remember how you used to play as a kid and try to replicate those feelings, if not the exact scenarios, in adulthood, Holman says. Maybe you sang in your school choir growing up. You don’t need to go as far as joining a local a cappella group, but you could make it a point to sing unabashedly in the shower, car, or at karaoke. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Pay attention to the feelings of joy or pleasure, Pringle says. By doing so, you can collect more evidence for why creativity and playfulness are worth prioritizing, giving you more of a reason to continue. For example, drawing has been shown to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-30383-001">reduce feelings of sadness and anger</a>. “You can notice, ‘This is doing something for me emotionally,’” Pringle says.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>You don’t need to go as far as joining a local a capella group, but you could make it a point to sing unabashedly in the shower, car, or at karaoke.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Gamifying the activity can make it more likely that you’ll stick with it, especially if this is an activity you enjoy, Milkman says. Whether that’s keeping up your streak on Duolingo, organizing a personal 30-day knitting challenge, or giving yourself a little treat every time you journal, anything that encourages continued behavior helps the habit stick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When life inevitably gets hectic and you feel short on time, remind yourself that you’re making space for this endeavor because it’s important to you. “Start with that sense of identity,” Pringle says. “We do those things that are important to who we are as a person. If you realize that, then you can start saying, ‘Well, how am I going to make the time?’ But the first step is being rooted in that sense of what is important to you as a human.”&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">2. Keep it low pressure</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Parents or people who work multiple jobs might not have the luxury of unscheduled hours to devote to extensive creative hobbies. But even the most strapped for time can imbue playfulness in the smaller moments. Notice the people around you on your commute or at the grocery store and try to imagine elaborate backstories for them. In the moments after you’ve finished dinner but before you start the dishes, pull out some scrap paper and doodle. “It doesn&#8217;t have to have that much pressure,” Holman says. “It&#8217;s not about the outcome. It&#8217;s about sitting for a moment and doodling and playing with the colors and trying to make some stripes.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you are resuming an old hobby from your past, don’t get hung up on technical proficiency, or lack thereof. It can feel demoralizing to pick up your guitar after many years and realize you’re rustier than you remembered. “It can undermine people&#8217;s confidence instead of building it,” Pringle says.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Confidence is crucial when maintaining creative hobbies, Pringle continues, and it comes from making progress, which only builds more confidence. So don’t try to talk yourself out of creating just because you’re struggling or your output is less than stellar. While you probably <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23979535/permission-to-suck-terrible-hobbies">will improve over time,</a> the true benefit comes from the act itself, not the outcome, Holman says. Ask yourself what success actually looks like. Do you need to bake a patisserie-worthy cake or can you throw a bunch of ingredients together and feel satisfied that you actually made something from scratch?&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3. Share your creations instead of monetizing them</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In today’s hustle culture, many are enticed to turn their hobbies into <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23640192/sebastian-ghiorghiu-youtube-hustle-gurus-passive-income-dropshipping">money-making ventures</a>. Aside from the obvious motivation — to earn more cash — the impulse to monetize hobbies comes from a desire to share your work, Holman says. Instead of opening an Etsy shop and slapping a price tag on your doodles, you could write a note on them and mail them to friends and family to satisfy that urge.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Leveraging hobbies as side hustles can actually hamstring creativity, Pringle says. Creating in order to turn a profit “puts the pressure of productivity on you,” Pringle says. When you’re only thinking about how to make more to sell more, you close yourself off to creative exploration: There’s no room for meandering when money is on the line. “We are not willing to do something just for the heck of it. We are not willing to do something although we don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going to lead,” Pringle says. “All of those things are absolutely necessary for creativity. If you know at every moment what you are doing, you are not doing creative work.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To invite creativity into your life, you need fewer constraints and rules — not more. Try to free yourself from what you believe you “should” be doing or the “right” way to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An artist in Germany who liked to draw outdoors showed up at the hospital with a bug bite and a host of symptoms that doctors couldn’t quite connect. After a month and several unsuccessful treatments, the patient started plugging his medical history into ChatGPT, <a href="https://www.anncaserep.com/open-access/the-use-of-chatgpt-in-diagnosing-tularemiandash-a-case-9930.pdf">which offered a diagnosis</a>: tularemia, also known as rabbit fever. The chatbot was correct, and the case was later written up in <a href="https://www.anncaserep.com/open-access/the-use-of-chatgpt-in-diagnosing-tularemiandash-a-case-9930.pdf">a peer-reviewed medical study</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the same time, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260">another study</a> described a man who appeared at a hospital in the United States with signs of psychosis, paranoid that his neighbor had been poisoning him. It turns out, the patient had asked ChatGPT for alternatives to sodium chloride, or table salt. The chatbot <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260">suggested sodium bromide</a>, which is used to clean pools. He’d been eating the toxic substance for three months and, once he’d stopped, required three weeks in a psychiatric unit to stabilize.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You’re probably familiar with consulting Google for a mystery ailment. You search the internet for your symptoms, sometimes find helpful advice, and sometimes get sucked into a vortex of anxiety and dread, convinced that you’ve got a rare, undiagnosed form of cancer. Now, thanks to the wonder that is generative AI, you can carry out this process in more detail. Meet Dr. ChatGPT.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>AI chatbots are an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given the ongoing doctor shortage as well as the broader barriers to accessing health care in the United States.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">ChatGPT is not a doctor in the same way that Google is not a doctor. Searching for medical information on either platform is just as likely to lead you to the wrong conclusion as it is to point toward the correct diagnosis. Unlike Google search, however, which simply points users to information, ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) invite people to have a conversation about it. They’re designed to be approachable, engaging, and always available. This makes AI chatbots an appealing stand-in for a human physician, especially given <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/361620/bloomberg-johns-hopkins-free-medical-school-doctor-shortage">the ongoing doctor shortage</a> as well as <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/391483/us-health-care-doctors-salary-medical-school">the broader barriers to accessing health care</a> in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As the rabbit fever anecdote shows, these tools can also ingest all kinds of data and, having been trained on reams of medical journals, sometimes arrive at expert-level conclusions that doctors missed. Or it might give you really terrible medical advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a difference between asking a chatbot for medical advice and talking to it about your health in general. Done right, talking to ChatGPT could lead to better conversations with your doctor and better care. Just don’t let the AI talk you into eating pool cleaner.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The right and wrong ways to talk to Dr. ChatGPT</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Plenty of people are talking to ChatGPT about their health. About one in six adults in the United States say they use AI chatbots for medical advice on a monthly basis, <a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/">according to a 2024 KFF poll</a>. A majority of them aren’t confident in the accuracy of the information the bots provide — and frankly, that level of skepticism is appropriate given the stubborn tendency for LLMs to hallucinate and the potential for bad health information to cause harm. The real challenge for the average user is knowing how to distinguish between fact and fabrication.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Honestly, I think people need to be very careful about using it for any medical purpose, especially if they don&#8217;t have the expertise around knowing what&#8217;s true and what&#8217;s not,” said <a href="https://www.daneshjoulab.com/people">Dr. Roxana Daneshjou</a>, a professor and AI researcher at the Stanford School of Medicine. “When it&#8217;s correct, it does a pretty good job, but when it&#8217;s incorrect, it can be pretty catastrophic.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Chatbots also have a tendency to be sycophantic, or eager to please, which means they might steer you in the wrong direction if they think that’s what you want.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The situation is precarious enough, Daneshjou added, that she encourages patients to go instead to Dr. Google, which serves up trusted sources. The search giant <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/health-info-knowledge-graph/">has been collaborating with experts from the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School for a decade</a> to present verified information about conditions and symptoms after the rise of something called “cyberchondria,” or health anxiety enabled by the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This condition <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB939076866193196830">is much older than Google</a>, actually. People have been searching for answers to their health questions since the Usenet days of the 1980s, and by the mid-2000s, eight in 10 people <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2006/10/29/online-health-search-2006/">were using the internet</a> to search for health information. Now, regardless of their reliability, chatbots are poised to receive more and more of these queries. Google even puts <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/google-ai-search">its problematic AI-generated results</a> for medical questions above <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/im-feeling-yucky-searching-for-symptoms/">the vetted results from its symptom checker</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you’ve got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you skip the symptom checking side of things, tools like ChatGPT can be really helpful if you just want to learn more about what’s going on with your health based on what your doctor’s already told you or to gain a better understanding of their jargony notes. Chatbots are designed to be conversational, and they’re good at it. If you’ve got a list of things to ask your doctor about, ChatGPT could help you craft questions. If you’ve gotten some test results and need to make a decision with your doctor about the best next steps, you can rehearse that with a chatbot without actually asking the AI for any advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, when it comes to just talking, there’s some evidence that ChatGPT is better at it. One <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37115527/">study from 2023</a> compared real physician answers to health questions from a Reddit forum to AI-generated responses when a chatbot was prompted with the same questions. Health care professionals then evaluated all of the responses and found that the chatbot-generated ones <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/im-feeling-yucky-searching-for-symptoms/">were both higher quality and more empathetic</a>. This is not the same thing as a doctor being in the same room as a patient, discussing their health. Now is a good time to point out that, on average, patients get <a href="https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/publications/measuring-primary-care-exam-length-using-electronic-health-record">just 18 minutes</a> with their primary care doctor on any given visit. If you go just once a year, that’s not very much time to talk to a doctor.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You should be aware that, unlike your human doctor, ChatGPT is not HIPAA-compliant. Chatbots generally <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/privacy-ai-era-how-do-we-protect-our-personal-information">have very few privacy protections</a>. That means you should expect any health information you upload will get stored in the AI’s memory and be used to train large language models in the future. It’s also theoretically possible that your data could end up being included in an output for someone else’s prompt. There are <a href="https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/how-to-protect-your-privacy-from-chatgpt-and-other-ai-chatbots/">more private ways to use chatbots</a>, but still, the hallucination problem and the potential for catastrophe exist.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The future of bot-assisted health care</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you’re not using AI to figure out medical mysteries, there’s a chance your doctor is. <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/o78em1y1w4i4/T7F5sDDiUC8KJzLQXfJoy/004be7f43562d318115a294cf626be7f/ClinicianOfTheFuture_2025.pdf?utm_source=banner&amp;utm_medium=dg&amp;utm_campaign=cotf&amp;utm_content=rpt">According to a 2025 Elsevier report</a>, about half of clinicians said they’d used an AI tool for work and slightly more said these tools save them time, and one in five say they’ve used AI for a second opinion on a complex case. This doesn’t necessarily mean your doctor is asking ChatGPT to figure out what your symptoms mean.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Doctors have been using AI-powered tools to help with everything from diagnosing patients to taking notes since well before ChatGPT even existed. These include clinical decision support systems built specifically for doctors, which currently outperform off-the-shelf chatbots — although the chatbots <a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/traditional-diagnostic-decision-support-systems-outperform-generative-ai">can actually augment the existing tools</a>. A 2023 study found that doctors working with ChatGPT <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825395">performed only slightly better</a> at diagnosing test cases than those working independently. Interestingly, ChatGPT alone performed the best.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That study <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/health/chatgpt-ai-doctors-diagnosis.html">made headlines</a>, probably for the suggestion that AI chatbots are better than doctors at diagnosis. One of its co-authors, <a href="https://research.bidmc.org/general-medicine/people/adam-rodman-md-mph-facp">Dr. Adam Rodman</a>, suggests that this wouldn’t necessarily be the case if doctors would be more open to listening to ChatGPT rather than assuming the chatbots were wrong when the doctor disagreed with their conclusions. Sure, the AI can hallucinate, but it can also spot connections that humans may have missed. Again, look at the rabbit fever case.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Patients need to talk to their doctors about their LLM use, and honestly, doctors should talk to their patients about <em>their</em> LLM use.” </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The average doctor has a sense of when something is hallucinating or going off the rails,” said Rodman, a hospitalist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and instructor at Harvard Medical School. “I don&#8217;t know that the average patient necessarily does.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, in the near term, you shouldn’t expect to see Dr. ChatGPT making an appearance at your local clinic. You’re more likely to see AI working <a href="https://theconversation.com/can-you-say-no-to-your-doctor-using-an-ai-scribe-264701">as a scribe</a>, saving your doctor time taking notes and possibly, one day, analyzing that data to help your doctor. Your doctor might use AI <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/health/ai-patient-messages-mychart.html">to help draft messages to patients</a> more quickly. In the near future, as AI tools get better, it’s possible that more clinicians use AI for diagnosis and second opinions. That still doesn’t mean you should rush to ChatGPT with your urgent medical concerns. If you do, tell your doctor about how that went.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Patients need to talk to their doctors about their LLM use, and honestly, doctors should talk to their patients about <em>their</em> LLM use,” said Rodman. “If we just both step kind of out of the shadow world and talk to each other, we&#8217;ll have more productive conversations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The death of Charlie Kirk reignited heated discussions about political speech in America, especially the value of arguing with people you disagree with.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One company, Jubilee Media, has tapped into that sentiment and has been going viral on YouTube these last couple of years with its high-energy and high-drama — and yes, gimmicky — debate shows where one person faces off against a big group of people who disagree with them. (Kirk himself made an appearance on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV29R1M25n8">Jubilee show</a> in 2024: “Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative?”)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Jason Y. Lee says he founded the company to foster debates and build empathy in a polarized country. But critics argue that some of Jubilee’s content could be categorized more as voyeuristic clickbait than high-minded discourse. One show has women arranging themselves based on perceived attractiveness and men rearranging them; another involves blindfolded guessing games about which participant is Black or white.  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, Mehdi Hasan — author and founder of his own media company, Zeteo, and former host of his own MSNBC show — appeared on Jubilee’s flagship debate show, <em>Surrounded</em>. His episode was called “1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives,” and that too made waves.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hasan said he was prepared to vigorously defend his views, something he’s become known for over the years. But when he showed up, he wasn’t expecting some of the featured debaters to openly call for his deportation (Hasan is a US citizen originally from England) — or for one to proudly declare himself a fascist. The episode offered unusual insight into the promise and perils of political debate, how we practice politics in the age of algorithms, and the value — and limits — of engaging with those you fundamentally disagree with.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Today, Explained</em> co-host Noel King spoke with Mehdi Hasan about his appearance on <em>Surrounded</em> — and what it taught him about this charged political moment.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140">Pandora</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A">Spotify</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Where did you learn to debate?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Where did I learn to debate? I think around the dinner table. My family is very disputatious. The Hasans are known for having strong views. There was a lot of debate around the kitchen table, the dining table, political, social, cultural, religious.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>We planned to do a show on the Jubilee debates and the argument about whether they are of value or not. And we called you because you appeared in one of these debates that went very viral, and then Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Utah and many people said Charlie Kirk was </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html"><strong>doing it right</strong></a><strong>. He was showing up; he was debating people he disagreed with. That&#8217;s the right way to do politics. Do you agree with that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">No, I don&#8217;t believe that Charlie Kirk was practicing politics the right way, to quote former Vox boss, now New York Times columnist, Ezra Klein, a good friend of mine. I totally disagree with Ezra on that piece he wrote. I do have to add the standard caveat because Fox keeps clipping some of us on the left out of context.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously [Kirk] shouldn&#8217;t have been killed. Obviously, we all condemn his murder. Obviously, a political assassination in response to speech you don&#8217;t like is unacceptable in America and very scary. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you&#8217;re asking me about the content of what Charlie Kirk said when he was alive, it was awful, it was horrific, it was reactionary, it was bigoted. This idea that he was some kind of Socratic debater trying to get to the truth? No, he wasn&#8217;t. He was doing a “Prove Me Wrong” tour over the years where he and Ben Shapiro and others go to college campuses, find some guy with blue hair who says something provocative and then dunk all over him, and then clip it up and go viral and then have a YouTube video saying, “Charlie Kirk/Ben Shapiro destroys college student.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>All right. What about Jubilee?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So Jubilee&#8217;s a little bit different. Jubilee claims to be nonpartisan; they say that they are trying to get people from all sides to get in a room together. I mean, on paper what they&#8217;re aspiring to is at minimum neutral, if not good. What turns up on YouTube is not necessarily always the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Tell me why you decided to go on </strong><strong><em>Surrounded</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There were multiple reasons. One is, as I say, I like a good argument and 20 to one — those are good odds. I&#8217;ll take those odds. The idea of going into the lion&#8217;s den and debating a bunch of people who disagree with me, I thought would be fun.  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Number two, I spoke to my good friend Sam Seder from the <em>Majority Report </em>who had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js15xgK4LIE">done a Jubilee</a>, and he told me that it&#8217;s worth doing. It does actually have value — you will reach a whole new audience. And people like my daughter and my nieces and others we&#8217;re saying, “Oh yeah, Jubilee, we know Jubilee, all the kids watch Jubilee.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And it&#8217;s amazing since I did Jubilee how many younger people are now coming up to me in the street versus older people because they recognize me from that circle debate show. So it was a chance to reach a new audience. That was number two.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And number three, it looked like a lot of right-wingers have been dominating that space. Prior to me going on Jubilee, all the top-rated people who had done Jubilee on YouTube with the most views were Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Candace Owens, Michael Knowles. That was the lean of YouTube and Jubilee. And I thought, well, actually, maybe people like me and Sam Seder can try and give a different point of view.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And what happened?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What happened was the craziest two hours of my professional life as a journalist. I was not expecting — and maybe I should have been — the kind of people I sat across. I&#8217;d watched a lot of Jubilees. I&#8217;d watched Sam Seder’s show. I knew there were a couple of people who came and said white supremacist things and far-right things and dumb things. But I didn&#8217;t expect one after another person to be telling me to my face that I should leave the country, that I&#8217;m not a real American. “I&#8217;m a proud fascist,” one person told me very early on in the debate.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What? Normally, people wanna deny the f-word. We spent the last week with Republicans up in arms that anyone would call them fascists, and how that&#8217;s what led to the death of Charlie Kirk. And yet here I was sitting in a warehouse with a bunch of young, mainly white people saying proudly, yes, we are fascists, we are racist.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do we debate fascists? Should a person debate fascists?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">No. And that&#8217;s why I said at the time, if you watch that clip, about halfway through the conversation, I said, “What are we doing here? I don&#8217;t debate fascists.” And all of the right-wingers watching in the circle, they got very upset because Jubilee then moved this guy out. And so many of them spent the next two hours, every time they came up to the chair to debate me, they would say, “Oh, you’re banning people you don’t agree with.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And I was like, “That&#8217;s not what it is. I don&#8217;t debate fascists because fascists don&#8217;t believe in democracy. They don&#8217;t believe in debate. They don&#8217;t believe in my equal worth as a human being. So why would I debate such people?”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Fascism at its core is an anti-democratic, authoritarian, and yes, very violent ideology. So, no, I don&#8217;t believe there is value to debating fascists. And if I&#8217;d known that people would be sitting down dismissing the Holocaust or saying, “I&#8217;m a fascist,” or saying the country was built for white people or whatever it is, I would not have gone on that show, or I would&#8217;ve said, “Get other people.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Look, I come from a proud anti-fascist tradition on the left where you don&#8217;t platform fascists, you don&#8217;t indulge them, you don&#8217;t meet them halfway. You defeat fascism by defeating the ideology, by offering something better and by being truthful.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You know, a person who appreciated your appearance on </strong><strong><em>Surrounded</em></strong><strong> might say, these fascist-y types are out there. They&#8217;re influencing young people in a real way. At least you showed up and gave them a run for their money.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That is the silver lining. I guess you could argue if — and this is gonna make me sound very egomaniacal and immodest, so I apologize in advance — I guess people could say, if you&#8217;re gonna debate fascists, might as well be someone who&#8217;s good at debating. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m known for doing. So it’s better me than someone else who goes on and gets their ass handed to them.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So in that sense, I get it, but the counterargument I get as well, a lot of my critics were saying to me: “Just by going on, you legitimize them just by going on. You amplified them just by going on. You gave them credibility and respectability. They were able to clip up their clips and put it online and say, ‘Look, look, look, we own this mainstream journalist. We told them to get the F out of our country.’ ” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do you think you changed anyone&#8217;s mind by appearing on </strong><strong><em>Surrounded</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Certainly not in that room. No. And that wasn&#8217;t the goal.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What is the goal in debating if not to change minds?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So my goal is not to change my opponent&#8217;s mind. Very rarely can you change your opponent&#8217;s mind. My goal is to change the people watching. When you&#8217;re debating on stage, as I have done, or whether you&#8217;re debating on YouTube and 10 or 11 or 12 million people now have watched that <em>Surrounded</em> show, you are hoping that in that 11 or 12 million people, there are a handful of people who are truly open-minded, truly independent people. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Most people are partisans, whether they want to admit so or not, but you hope that you found some independent folks to go, “Hmm, that&#8217;s a good point that I hadn&#8217;t heard before, that&#8217;s a good statistic that I wasn&#8217;t aware of, that&#8217;s a good way of framing the issue.” And, look, people have reached out to me over the years. I&#8217;ve spent the last year and a half doing nonstop debates. I&#8217;ve done a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amz2Sf1JMDE">debating about Gaza</a>, another very polarizing issue, and people have reached out to me, and I have had messages from people saying, “I have switched my positions on this issue.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bullet casings authorities recovered during their investigation of Charlie Kirk’s killing make at least one thing clear: The alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, was speaking the language of memes.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Hey Fascist! Catch!”, “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao,” and “O Bella ciao…” read some of the engravings on bullets, both used and unused, in the shooting last week. Their meanings are hard to parse —&nbsp;they’re ideologically inconsistent, wrapped in layers of irony and earnestness, and reference various online communities and video games.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a text exchange with his roommate and partner, reproduced by authorities in charging documents, Robinson <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/16/text-messages-charlie-kirk-tyler-robinson-sent">references</a> the inscriptions, calling them “mostly a big meme.” “[If] I see ‘notices bulge uwu’ on fox new[s] I might have a stroke,” Robinson allegedly said. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It all suggests this act of violence, which seems to have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/politics/charlie-kirk-tyler-robinson-motive">driven by</a> opposition to “hate” Robinson thought Kirk was spreading as well as some left-leaning ideas, was also wrapped up in a kind of dark, nihilistic, deeply online meme culture that has been spawning, or at least inspiring, acts of violence over the last half-decade. Memes started to make more of an appearance in the killings carried out by mass shooters, <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/charlie-kirk-was-killed-by-a-meme">beginning most notably in 2019</a>, during attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Memes, and deeply online references, also appeared in Luigi Mangione’s alleged killing of a health insurance CEO and in school shootings this year in Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a complicated world to parse, so we turned to Elle Reeve, someone who has a history of investigating and explaining the shady corners of the internet that have started dealing serious damage in the real world. Reeve is a correspondent for CNN and the author of the book <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Black-Pill/Elle-Reeve/9781982198893"><em>Black Pill: How I Witnessed the Darkest Corners of the Internet Come to Life, Poison Society, and Capture American Politics</em></a> —&nbsp;all about the kinds of (mostly) men who get sucked into dark worlds online, and <a href="https://x.com/elspethreeve/status/1967391648037708094">as she’s put it</a>, “talk themselves into doing strange, cruel, or violent things because it all started with just jokes, man.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of Reeve’s conversation with us, edited for length and clarity. Listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140">Pandora</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A">Spotify</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It’s been almost a week since Charlie Kirk was killed. What do we know at this point about his alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To me, we still don&#8217;t know enough. We know that he was a young man, he is referred to as very smart and quiet by a lot of his friends that have talked to the press. He scored well in his ACT, according to a post his mom made, but he dropped out of college after the first semester. He was a big gamer — really into video games. And according to investigators, he was dating his roommate, [who they say is transgender].</p>
<div class="megaphone-embed"><a href="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?p=VMP5705694065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Link</a></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The first tranche of information we got about this alleged shooter was when investigators revealed what he allegedly wrote on the bullet casings. Could you help us understand what exactly he wrote?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So the first one is “Notices bulge OWO what’s this?” This is a furry meme. This one has thrown a lot of people for a loop. Luckily, people aren&#8217;t trying to attribute a lot of politics to it because it&#8217;s so confusing. But it&#8217;s a reference to furries. It&#8217;s a 10-year-old meme. It comes from an image that&#8217;s a drawing of two middle-aged, unattractive men role-playing with each other online, making sexy talk as furries. And if people don’t know, that’s kind of like a sort of sexual thing where you like imagining yourself as an anthropomorphic animal, usually a specific one…&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He wrote a whole bunch of jokes. He wrote dumb internet jokes. Some of them, if it were in a movie, would be funny. But he wrote them before killing a person. That&#8217;s what’s, honestly, pretty chilling. It&#8217;s one of the details that&#8217;s hard for me to get past.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So this can be interpreted as a pro-furry joke or an anti-furry joke because hating furries on the internet is a big thing both in the right-wing world and in other very online spaces. But it’s also been reclaimed by furries, kind of like the word “queer.” So the point of saying all that is that an outsider trying to establish with certainty what exactly was being expressed by this message — that’s a fool’s errand. You just don’t know. We just don’t know. We’re getting a few more details, but it&#8217;s still pretty ambiguous.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Which feels similar to another casing, which said, “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao.”</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Exactly. That’s the fourth cartridge. And that one —&nbsp;again, I saw other people pick this up on the internet — for me, what it conjures is, like a grizzled law enforcement veteran, bulletproof vest, bends down in the dust to pick up a piece of evidence. And it says, “If you read this, you’re gay,” right? You’re supposed to laugh, or the image is funny. And yet he did it before killing somebody. So it’s not a strong statement about how you should vote in the midterms, that’s for sure.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do the rest of them say?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So the second cartridge says, “Hey, Fascist! Catch!” and has these arrow symbols. It’s a reference to a video game called Helldivers 2, which is kind of like a fascist satire. The arrow symbols are what bring the biggest bomb in the game. The third cartridge is, “Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao, Ciao.” So that’s an old anti-fascist song, history buffs are very familiar with this…I&#8217;m told it’s a meme among anti-fascists —&nbsp;I have done quite a bit of reporting with them and I had never come across it. But that&#8217;s the internet, I guess… It&#8217;s become more popular because it’s in a Netflix show called <em>Money Heist</em>. And if you go on TikTok, you can see people doing goofy dances to it while ordering coffee. And it’s in a video game as well. But broadly, this could be taken as a left-wing anti-fascist message.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And is this what leads people to immediately say that this guy is left-wing?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That and the bulge thing, I heard Ted Cruz say it was a transgender meme, which is false.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is there some sort of throughline in what Tyler Robinson may have written on these casings?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, he’s really into video games. And the dominant pose in these very online chat rooms is ironic detachment — so many layers of irony that you can’t even fully understand the author&#8217;s meaning, other than that they’re implying “we&#8217;re part of an in-group and the people outside don’t understand.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And what do we know about the online spaces that Tyler may have lived in?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We don&#8217;t know enough. We just don’t know enough. We know he was in a few Discords at minimum.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Discord is a gaming chat platform, but you don’t have to be using a video game to use it. If you have Slack at work, or something like that, it’s kind of like that. There’s a group chat function, you can do one-on-one chats, you can talk by audio and by video. I’ve done quite a bit of reporting in these Discord servers that become cultures unto themselves. They become almost cult-like. I’ve interviewed incels who spent like 18 hours a day in their Discord server. The Discord server of white nationalists became very important evidence in a federal civil trial involving Charlottesville [and the Unite the Right rally].&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">How can I put this? The culture, it can become this bubble that leads to very intense groupthink. But what we’ve seen so far of his messages on Discord — and Discord did confirm that Tyler Robinson had an account — it isn&#8217;t like that.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We know he had a server with about 30 friends. They messaged him being like, “Bro, you look like these pictures of the alleged shooter.” He&#8217;s like, “My doppelganger is trying to get me in trouble. Ha ha ha. Better throw away my manifesto and exact copy rifle.” So if he was in a very political space, we have not yet seen evidence of that.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And Discord itself does not necessarily have a right lean or a left lean.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">No, no, it&#8217;s not for that. And there are anti-fascist servers and communist ones and right-wing ones and fascist ones and incel ones.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The part of the culture that is unsettling is that you see in a lot of these spaces is just this nihilistic, black-pilled, ironic culture where nothing is taken seriously. Like you’re a loser if you take something seriously.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Which maybe explains why the bullet casings have a bunch of absurdist memes written all over them.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Right. Exactly. Which is how you possibly could get to the place of writing on a shell casing, “if you read this, you&#8217;re gay.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is the bullet casing thing becoming like the new manifesto? It&#8217;s not the first time we&#8217;ve seen this in one of these high-profile killings in the past year.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So a lot of these mass shooters or public assassinations, they reference each other. So Luigi Mangione [allegedly] wrote on three bullets, “deny, defend, depose,” a reference to how health insurance companies deny people coverage for care that they need. The first time I remember this being a big thing, specifically with messages written on the weaponry in order to be a message to not the wider world, but the circle of online people, the crowd or gang that they hung out in, was with the 2019 Christchurch shooting. That man wrote all kinds of memes all over his guns before killing 51 people in two mosques in New Zealand. That guy had been on this website, 8chan, which is now called 8kun. And…I mean, it was clear from that that he wanted to be a meme. He wrote it for that audience. … It was about speaking to people on 8chan. And he did become a meme there. There are all kinds of illustrations and cartoons and memes about him there. And that’s when I started noticing it happening over and over on these weapons.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There was the recent shooting at the Annunciation School in Minnesota. That person also seems to be part of a very strange, nihilistic Discord, and they wrote a lot of messages in English but with Cyrillic letters. But yeah, this is a recurring thing, writing memes on the gun.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And is that to say that these shooters, though they may have very different politics and beliefs, are influencing each other?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Oh, definitely. They obsess over each other. The shooter [who] killed several people at a grocery store in Buffalo in 2022 — his manifesto and actions very directly referenced the Christchurch shooter.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What more did we learn about the alleged Kirk shooter from the charges yesterday?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The really fascinating thing is his texts with his significant other/roommate after the shooting.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s clear from the transcript that the roommate was surprised by this.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And he’s obsessed with the rifle that was his grandfather’s rifle, and particularly that his father will be angry if he has lost the rifle. It’s one of the other just surreal things in this exchange. You [allegedly] just killed a guy, and all he can think about is, “my dad’s gonna be so mad if I don&#8217;t bring back grandpa’s rifle.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think it speaks to the unreality of it all. And there’s another message that’s related to what we’ve been talking about. He says, “Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fucking messages are mostly a big meme. If I see, ‘notices bulge, uwu’ on Fox News, I might have a stroke.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>This whole incident, or at least what we know of it so far, just feels like a very uncomfortable clash of </strong><strong><em>I live online</em></strong><strong> versus </strong><strong><em>I live in the real world</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, yes. And particularly when talking to older colleagues who did not grow up online, it&#8217;s been very hard to explain. And you see it in the national discourse, too. This is not about supporting Trump, anti-Trump. It doesn’t break down into easy political motivations. Many of the young people that I have talked to who are like…locked into these worlds, they think that’s absurd, rooting for one party or another. You’re a dupe or a fool if you care about that stuff.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It’s probably helpful to clarify what we mean by these people being “very online.” It’s something very different than what a lot of us know.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Right, it’s not just like scrolling Twitter a lot and being appalled by it. Just to talk about the specific people I&#8217;ve talked to, I got really deep into this incel Discord, where people literally were spending 18 hours or more online, sometimes they go on binges, more than 24 hours, and the computer was their whole life. They’d be popping in and out of other related Discord servers, chatting, or going on camera or just going on voice.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The server that I was particularly investigating, these guys were obsessed with not being able to get laid, feeling doomed by the way they looked or their personalities, to never get a woman to have sex with them, much less have a relationship and be a normal part of society. But, well, you could start by going outside.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A guy I interviewed in southern Florida, he lived really close to the beach. But he said he’d only been a couple times. He even said to me that one time he was standing in the water looking out at the waves at the horizon and thought, “This is beautiful, but I would like it better if it were on my computer screen.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>That&#8217;s grim.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes I’ll interview people, and we’re talking about this person [as if they’re someone] I should know, a celebrity, and I look them up and maybe it’s someone with a YouTube account with 300 subscribers. And I&#8217;m like,<em> Why am I supposed to know about this</em>? But it has been an object of fixation within that chat room for so much time, they forget that the outside world doesn&#8217;t think that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>One of the reasons this meme world talk has blown up is that policymakers and normal people are wondering, </strong><strong><em>How big is this world? How big is this threat? Is it poisoning the minds of young people?</em></strong><strong> How do we understand the scale of it all?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, one way to think of it is like Gen Z and Gen Alpha, for them, the internet is the mainstream media, right? It&#8217;s not like maybe we watch the Emmys and we’re checking Twitter on the side as old millennials. But their main stuff is TikTok, Discord, for whatever they&#8217;re into.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Does that mean we can expect more of this element of absurdism, deeply layered irony in future violent extremists or shooters or gunmen? Will that be the case because of how widespread this online culture seems to be?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It kind of depends on the subculture. I did a lot of reporting on accelerationists who are trying to accelerate the collapse of society because they think it’s irredeemable. So what comes after will be something valuable, a golden age, something better than what we have now. The people I interviewed, that’s how they give themselves permission to do bad things. “I&#8217;m bringing down this corrupt society.” So all of that is permitted.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So this isn’t something that we should expect to not happen again.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, there will still be people who believe in regular stuff, you know? But it is a very large contingent of online culture.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So what do we do to stop this, to combat this? Is it about isolation and loneliness? Is it about regulating online time?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can look visually at what a lot of the memes communicate. There are a lot of depictions of lonely men who are sad, standing in the middle of a ruined society, some kind of grim atmosphere, and I think that does speak to the way people are feeling. And also like, a lot of kids who spent their critical years locked up during Covid, and it wasn’t good for their brain. I mean, even in regular life, post-Covid, I’ve talked to a lot of people who feel this way, like the work happy hour is more awkward than it used to be, than it was before Covid when people retreated from the world.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Once you stop forcing yourself to confront social anxiety, it gets bigger and bigger and I think that leads to a lot of alienation. There’s a nihilistic blackmail cult called 764, the FBI is investigating it, but they look for kids in these online spaces, convince them to send them nudes, and then blackmail these children into doing horrible things, like killing their own pets.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m a parent of a toddler. I just want to be like a crazy fundamentalist about my kid not going on the internet. That can be the adversity you have to overcome — a crazy mom who saw an incel shit his pants on purpose in front of her just to troll her. Like, sorry dude, you’re just not going on the internet or you’re not getting unfettered access to a phone until you’re…I don&#8217;t know, 35?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>This is really grim.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you want some hope?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Yeah</strong>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So I have these incels I first interviewed in 2018, I thought doing a story on them, maybe they would see that they&#8217;re not so hopeless if they just went outside and joined society. They were still chatting me from it four years later, but I just reached out to them during this to ask, “What&#8217;s your take?” And they’ve left. They rejoined, they have jobs, they go outside.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people that I thought were in like the blackest possible space have left, so it is possible. And when I go in that old Discord server, the incel one, I was scrolling up through it, all the chats were from <em>deleted user, deleted user, deleted user. </em>“Deleted user” being — their accounts are gone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Fearless journalism needs your support now more than ever. </em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-now?itm_campaign=article-header-Q42024&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article">Become a Vox Member to support our work today</a></em></strong><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s be clear about what just happened: Jimmy Kimmel, a prominent late-night comedian, was just taken off the airwaves because the Trump administration didn’t like what he had to say —&nbsp;and threatened his employer until they shut him up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration, it appears, has learned to effectively weaponize the regulatory powers of the federal government to punish speech it doesn’t like from people it doesn’t like.&nbsp;This is a favored weapon of modern autocrats; its deployment against Kimmel is a qualitative escalation even above the administration’s previous acts of censorship (like targeting <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/406199/ice-rumeysa-ozturk-tufts-logoff">the author of a pro-Palestine op-ed</a> for deportation).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What just happened, in short, shows how far down the authoritarian road the United States has traveled in just eight months.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Jimmy Kimmel and the abuse of state powers</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel’s downfall began with some admittedly ill-advised speculation in Monday’s monologue: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the evidence suggested the shooter very likely was not a MAGA believer (and evidence released the next day showed that he almost certainly was on the political left).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Kimmel’s aside —&nbsp;in a <a href="https://x.com/latenightercom/status/1968455055251562716">monologue mostly focused on mocking President Donald Trump</a> —&nbsp;did not justify what came next. During a Wednesday podcast appearance, FCC head Brendan Carr threatened to <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1968392506711613526">revoke the broadcasting licenses of any stations</a> that continued to air Kimmel’s content.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s time for them to step and say this garbage…isn’t something that we think serves the needs of our local communities,” he said.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr’s threat should have been toothless. The FCC is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/fcc-and-speech">prohibited by law</a> from employing “the power of censorship” or interfering “with the right of free speech.” There is a very narrow and rarely used exception for “news distortion,” in which a broadcast news outlet knowingly airs false reports. What Kimmel did&nbsp;—&nbsp;an offhand comment based on weak evidence — is extremely different from creating a news report with the intent to deceive.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But months before the shooting, Carr had <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/news-distortion-the-new-fake-news/">begun investigating complaints under this exception</a> against ABC and CBS stations, specifically allegations of anti-conservative bias. Stations had to take Carr’s threat seriously — even though Carr himself had declared (in <a href="https://x.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1841651190783684620">a 2024 tweet</a>) that “the First Amendment prohibits government officials from coercing private parties into suppressing protected speech.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hours after Carr’s Wednesday threat, Nexstar — the largest owner of local stations in America — suddenly decided that Kimmel’s comments from two nights ago were unacceptable. Nexstar, it should be noted, is currently attempting to purchase one of its major rivals for $6.2 billion — a merger that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/business/media/nexstar-tegna-deal.html">would require express FCC approval</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Mr. Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse,” Andrew Alford, the president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division, said in a statement. “Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Without access to Nexstar’s roughly 200 stations — covering about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/business/media/nexstar-tegna-deal.html">39 percent</a> of the national market, the maximally allowed cap — Kimmel would suffer an enormous ratings blow.&nbsp;And so, shortly after Nexstar’s announcement, ABC/Disney announced that he’d be suspended indefinitely.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has had it in for Jimmy Kimmel, a prominent critic, for a very long time. After CBS axed fellow late-night Trump critic Stephen Colbert earlier this year, the president repeatedly said that Kimmel was “<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114874422468516376" rel="nofollow">next</a>.” Kimmel’s Kirk comments, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/media/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-trump-fcc-brendan-carr">both an FCC commissioner</a> and (reportedly) <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jimmy-kimmel-out-abc-charlie-kirk-comments-1235430078/">ABC executives</a> considered well within bounds, seem like a pretext — taking advantage of the pervasive climate of fear and censorship in the wake of Kirk’s death to punish a prominent name on the president’s enemies list.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The weaponization of seemingly neutral “good government” rules, like broadcast regulation, to punish the enemies of the current president is a familiar turn in the story of democratic backsliding. It was one of the principal tools used by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to batter his country’s press into submission, ultimately forcing independent outlets to sell to government-aligned conglomerates who transformed their editorial stance.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It would take quite a bit more work for Trump to consolidate Orbán-levels of control over the media. But what’s so striking about the Kimmel case is how swiftly Nexstar (and ABC) rolled over. They didn’t even try to put up a fight to defend their own ability to control what goes on their airwaves. They instead apparently decided that fighting the government is costly and risky, putting licenses or even a valuable merger at risk, and that risking that isn’t worth it for Jimmy Kimmel.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is what it looks like when a society’s elite rolls over in the face of authoritarianism. It never ends well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This morning, ousted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Susan Monarez came to the Senate to share her story of being fired by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President Donald Trump, the latest volley in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and the public health establishment.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Monarez’s testimony, the upcoming meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — which will take place over the next two days — had been the impetus for her ouster. She testified that, during a contentious meeting with Kennedy before she was fired, he asked her to approve, sight unseen, the new vaccine recommendations that would be made by his new ACIP. The panel is now staffed by experts who were handpicked by Kennedy, who also asked her to fire career CDC vaccine scientists. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During her testimony before the Senate health committee, Monarez maintained composure as many Republican senators sought to cast doubt on her credibility. But the committee chair, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who is also a trained physician, was a counter-force: He issued his own warning about unjustified changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, particularly the hepatitis B shot.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And now, what could be the real breaking point for Kennedy’s Make America Healthy agenda is here.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At tomorrow’s and Friday’s meetings, the ACIP will discuss possible changes to the childhood vaccine schedule and the federal government’s guidance for the Covid-19 and hepatitis B vaccines and for measles-mumps-rubella shots. The guidance for hepatitis B shots, in particular, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-committee-meeting-infants.html">may be changed</a>, and emerged as a flashpoint at Wednesday’s hearing.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The rift over the hepatitis B vaccine, briefly explained</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">How did the hepatitis B shot suddenly become so central in this debate? It’s long been a target of anti-vaccine activists because it is given within the first day of a child’s life. And in today’s Senate hearing, some Republicans sounded on board with making changes: Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) suggested that the timing of the vaccine, which is currently offered to newborn babies, should be pushed back. He argued that unless the mother is known to have hepatitis B, giving the vaccine that early was unnecessary.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the end of the hearing, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), the committee chair, offered a rebuke: He noted that a child infected at birth with hepatitis B has a more than 90 percent chance of developing a chronic infection — and he pointed out that the US used to see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-committee-meeting-infants.html">20,000 babies infected by hepatitis B every year</a>, before the vaccine became standard in the early 1990s. Now it’s less than 20.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“That,” he emphasized, “is an accomplishment to make America healthy again. And we should stand up and salute the people who made the decision, because there are people who would otherwise be dead if their mothers weren’t given the choice of that vaccine.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Cassidy also underscored that the CDC does not <em>mandate</em> the hepatitis B vaccine; it only requires the insurance company to pay for the shot — and that’s only if the parents want it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Now that we’ve controlled [hepatitis B], do we let the genie out of the bottle?” he asked, observing that if the ACIP removes the recommendation for newborns to get the hepatitis B shot, health insurers may no longer cover the cost.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today’s hearing with the former CDC director didn’t result in widespread calls for Kennedy’s resignation. But the opposition to his aggressive overhaul of vaccine policy has been building for some time.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU-ijk73OF0"> grilled Kennedy over the value of vaccines</a> at another hearing earlier this month. Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/gop-lawmakers-dont-sound-enthused-about-rfk-jr-00564704">reported</a> on a growing ambivalence among other GOP lawmakers, too. But Kennedy still has a lot of allies in his corner; except for Cassidy and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), most of the Republican questions for Monarez at the Wednesday hearing were hostile and sought to cast doubt on her credibility.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Cassidy could really escalate the situation. He’s always been the most closely watched Republican senator when it comes to Kennedy and the MAHA agenda. He’s the health committee chair, and because he’s a trained physician, he has a lot of credibility among experts and the public. If he wants to make life difficult for Kennedy, he can — by investigating the health agency, calling for more testimony, and opposing his agenda on the Senate floor.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now Cassidy has all but issued a warning to ACIP and Kennedy against making an unjustified change to the hepatitis B vaccine guidance. They’ll make their countermove in the coming days.</p>
