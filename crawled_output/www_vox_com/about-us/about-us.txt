Our world has too much noise and too little context. Vox helps you understand what matters.
What We DoWe live in a world with too much news and not enough understanding. Audiences are sending a clear signal: News fatigue and avoidance are up, public trust in the media is down.Vox is the antidote. Audiences trust Vox because we tell them what truly matters and how to think about it. We do the work — sift through information, read the studies, talk to experts, and gather a range of perspectives. We don’t drown you in panic-inducing headlines. We’re not obsessed with being the first to break the news; we’re focused on being helpful to you. We offer clarity, insight, and tools to help you live a better life. And we have fun, too.Our audience is at the heart of everything we do. We’re not focused on serving people in power — we’re focused on serving you, our audience. We want you to walk away from a Vox story and feel like you’ve learned something new, or understand a topic more deeply.Our journalism is written and produced to be accessible to all, whether you’re a subject-matter expert or hearing about something for the very first time. We report urgently and thoroughly on the most important stories shaping our world, but also on issues the rest of the media neglects. We explain some of the biggest challenges humanity faces, but we also offer ideas and solutions to confront them.Vox exists for you. Tell us how we can be useful.What We CoverVox’s staff of journalists and subject-matter experts research, report and produce articles, videos, and podcasts that make complex ideas accessible. Whether it’s politics, policy, culture, democracy, animal welfare, biodiversity, artificial intelligence, the climate crisis, or how to live a better life, we give context to what’s happening today.Hidden required texthidden required textVox Podcasts: Unexplainable, The Gray Area, Today, Explained and Explain It To MeVox’s Even Better and Future Perfect columnsVox Shorts and America, Explained on YouTubeOur Guiding PrinciplesOur audience is at the heart of what we do. Where other outlets focus on keeping up with — and writing for — their peers, or people in power, we’re focused on someone more important: you. We never lose sight of the fact that major events impact real people’s lives.Transparency builds trust. We accept that journalists have their own biases — and must be aware of them. We work hard to acknowledge our biases, and be fair and empathetic to all perspectives. We’re transparent about the process, clear about our views, and always show our work, so that you can form your own opinion. Identity is central to almost every story. Identity-related topics touch every part of our culture and society, and should be addressed as such. Talking to a diverse array of sources and understanding a variety of perspectives is essential in delivering the right stories.Explanatory journalism is a public good. We believe that when more people understand why something is happening, we’re all better off.We don’t start with foregone conclusions. We’re not afraid to make a bold statement backed by expertise and reporting. We explore all points of view with generosity, empathy, and fairness, but we put facts first.Our StoryWhen Vox was founded in 2014, it was animated by a simple observation: The media did a good job of reporting the news and commenting on it, but there was a disconnect between that work and the audience truly understanding why something happened. Vox started as — and remains — an organization dedicated to addressing that gap, which not only persists but has grown.We are proud to have popularized explanatory journalism in many forms, across many mediums. Our work has been used to educate people everywhere from elementary schools to college classrooms to vaccination sites in Taiwan to footnotes in congressional memos. We’ve received numerous awards, including News and Documentary Emmys, Online Journalism Awards, and Loeb Awards. We were a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for our collaboration with ProPublica on maternal mortality.

The ‘out of the box’ ideas convey a way of thinking that many mainstream media publications don’t provide.”
