Everything about â€˜The History of Sound' is restrained to a fault.
Rated: 2/4

Maxwell Rabb
Chicago Reader
The History of Sound is too tonally restrained to deliver the heart-wrenching love story it aspires to. A meandering narrative further undercuts its romantic potential, too assured in its soft tone to fully unravel its charactersâ€™ pain.

Natalia Winkelman
New York Times
The History of Sound doesnâ€™t trust its own gentleness, and the inertia of the filmmaking gives the whole affair a detached, try-hard feeling.

Discussing Film
Some might be left underwhelmed by the quiet, restrained forbidden romance at the center of The History of Sound, but the movie actually thrives off those untold feelings and emotions, especially when Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor are at their best.
Rated: 4/5

Cinemalogue
... understated to the point of frustration, with conflicts remaining largely internalized and its poignancy rarely resonating as deeply as intended.

Geek Vibes Nation
It isnâ€™t the most engrossing or even inviting take on romance, but there is a loveliness to find within the stillness.

Engaging in its simplicity. Gorgeous cinematography without overstatement or reliance on gimmicks. Beautiful lighting, incredibly subdued and human story.

Ana W.
I loved the delicate and emotional tone of this film. Very masculine and also very sensual. Itâ€™s weird to me how they have foreign actors performing such deep American music roots but valid- their performances were just beautiful and very talented. The film should be seen in a big theater and not at home. I liked very much! Loved it!

A truly beautiful film with a haunting story that unfolds through stunning backdrops. The direction and cinematography are top-notch, and the tender and fragile love story adds a poignant and authentic layer to the experience.
