When limiting by date range, the lower bound of the "from" date
and the upper bound of the "to" date are used.For example,
searching with From: 2012-02 and To: 2013
will search for papers submitted from
2012-02-01 to 2013-12-31.

Searching by Author Name
Using the Author(s) field produces best results for author name searches.
For the most precise name search, follow surname(s), forename(s) or surname(s), initial(s) pattern: example Hawking, S or Hawking, Stephen
For best results on multiple author names, separate individuals with a ; (semicolon). Example: Jin, D S; Ye, J
Author names enclosed in quotes will return only exact matches. For example, "Stephen Hawking" will not return matches for Stephen W. Hawking.
Diacritic character variants are automatically searched in the Author(s) field.
Queries with no punctuation will treat each term independently.
Searching by subcategory
To search within a subcategory select All fields.
A subcategory search can be combined with an author or keyword search by clicking on add another term in advanced search.
Tips
Wildcards:
Use ? to replace a single character or * to replace any number of characters.
Can be used in any field, but not in the first character position. See Journal References tips for exceptions.
Expressions:
TeX expressions can be searched, enclosed in single $ characters.
Phrases:
Enclose phrases in double quotes for exact matches in title, abstract, and comments.
Dates:
Sorting by announcement date will use the year and month the original version (v1) of the paper was announced.
Sorting by submission date will use the year, month and day the latest version of the paper was submitted.
Journal References:
If a journal reference search contains a wildcard, matches will be made using wildcard matching as expected. For example, math* will match math, maths, mathematics.
If a journal reference search does not contain a wildcard, only exact phrases entered will be matched. For example, math would match math or math and science but not maths or mathematics.
All journal reference searches that do not contain a wildcard are literal searches: a search for Physica A will match all papers with journal references containing Physica A, but a search for Physica A, 245 (1997) 181 will only return the paper with journal reference Physica A, 245 (1997) 181.
