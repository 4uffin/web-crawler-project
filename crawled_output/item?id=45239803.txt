You didn’t need “sources of information”.
Trump was in office for four years before he was re-elected.
It’s copium to think that people aré ignorant when in actuality, they are actively
hostile to minorities, non straight, the college educated and non Christians.They would rather feel the fallout of Republican policies
as long as it doesn’t help or actively
hurts people not like them.
In my former home state GA, the Republican governor spent years
and tens of millions of dollars trying to get the Hyundai plant to GA that would have created 8500 jobs directly and no telling how many indirect jobs.ICE invaded the plant and the opportunity is now lost potentially.
The governor
still can’t bring himself to criticize the President and the Republicans in GA are cheering the raid.

Harris lost the popular vote by less than 2%. I know that popular vote is not what gets a president elected, but you make it sound like nobody voted for Harris and the entire American electorate liked Trump's views and voted for him.replyDrewADesign 17 minutes ago

> Absolutely no one who voted for this mess went in blind.I think it depends. I suspect that political messaging has become so tailored that the Mercola/Natural News crowd that voted primarily because of RFK’s anti-vaxxing platform could have been getting so heavily hammered with the “this is the ’chemicals are bad’ administration” messaging that the anti-regulatory stuff seemed pretty quiet in comparison. And I’m pretty sure they also had things they disagreed with Harris about constantly rammed down their throats. I also think that democrat voters had negative things about Trump shoved down their throat, and that messaging difference is probably the main reason many on the right wing are absolutely mystified that people can hate Trump so much, even in spite of the ‘own the libs’ culture war garbage.I have a list of news sources I hit weekly from Dissent and Jacobin to mainstream TV news and newspapers, to Hot Air and Town Hall. Most are pretty politically homogenous, but discuss all sorts of topics. Then I see how laser-focused a relative’s Facebook feed is on topics that are important to her… not just the political platform on a whole, but those specific things. It’s forgivable that she’d think her primary concerns were representative of most people’s primary concerns, and why she’s thinks people that are heavily focused on other topics are kind of weird.replycrawfordcomeaux 50 minutes ago

Kindly stop supporting a nation built on genocide and enslavement. The ethical path to engineering a system that's not intended to kill people is to stop it when it does and dismantle it, evolving the foundational principles used to design it in the first place. And to do all that without sacrificing more lives. Electoral reform is impossible because there's no way to say no to the entire system.replysunsetSamurai 47 minutes ago

The right managed to succeed with their electoral reforms.
Gerrymandering is legal, and the president is now above the law.The left should use the same tactics:
Focus on state and local elections then use those positions to fix elections so that the national majority of voters decide who runs the federal government (instead of the current 25-30% of voters).Doing this is completely legal now that the Supreme Court has gutted the rule of law.For starters, all states should aggressively gerrymand.
That’ll basically guarantee the house goes democrat in 2026:https://www.natesilver.net/p/democrats-can-win-the-redistric...If the democrats fail to do this, it’s not mere incompetence.

What a muddled videoFor the first half he seems to constantly mix up C8 and Teflon. After a long section explaining that C8 is some carrier molecule used to make Teflon - he then explain C8 is used in factories and kills cows. But it's not clear C8 is anywhere other than the factory and the town around itThey then extrapolate from two chemical (C8 and C6) to just anything that remotely similar (PFAS)Later they walk it back and say it's only a few chemicals. Actually your Teflon pan is safe. But then say thing "Blah blah was used to make waterproof..." is it in the final product? or is it part of the chemical procedure to make the product?Is the problem the final consumer goods? Or is the problem the chemical manufacturing? (and subsequent dumping in the environment) Is this residue from after making the Teflon-like material?The last parts I couldn't follow at all b/c it was a acronym soup of a ton of chemicals that aren't really explained. At this point I'd lost all faith in the presenters impartiality. Seems like he's just trying to stoke outrage for engagement(the central point may still be right!)replyestebarb 1 hour ago

Cane sugar and corn syrup are both just sugar. Your health isn't going to be any better drinking cane sugar coke than corn syrup coke.The reason corn syrup is demonized is because it is cheap, enabling lots of foods to pack sugar without much cost. The health concerns remain consistent across all forms of sugar.replytraceroute66 3 minutes ago

> The reason corn syrup is demonized is because it is cheap, enabling lots of foods to pack sugar without much cost.This !The OP made a bad point using coke as an example.The actual point is the HFCS and the fact that HFCS is used extensively in the US, often in places you would not expect it.In bread products for example its common to find HFCS in it in the US.The Europeans rarely put any form of sugar in their bread doughs unless they are explicitly baking a sweet product.
And even then, the concentration is lower.replythrowaway5752 35 minutes ago
| root | parent | prev | next [–]
Incorrect. There is more fructose in HFCS used in Coke, HFCS 55. Fructose is metabolized in the liver, and stored as fat there. Glucose is directly metabolized by cells throughout the body.Also there is no single reason that HFCS is demonized, there are multiple good reasons why it is harmful in the US. It is also not a singular cause to all US diet related pathologies.Staying on topic, the chemicals the EPA will no longer enforce the laws for pollution for are demonstrably harmful.The EPA has unilaterally decided not to do its job because it doesn't care about the health of the citizens of the US.replyWorkaccount2 11 minutes ago

Exactly. To remind us - it's the fructose which is a metabolic problem in amounts over a certain value - worth checking out why. Cane sugar and beet sugar both contain sucrose which is one glucose linked to one fructose molecule so you get half the fructose.replySpicyLemonZest 37 minutes ago

You don’t get half because nobody’s sweetening things with 100% fructose. The most common HFCS compositions are 42% and 55% fructose.replynatebc 1 hour ago

There is resistance to change, adapt and make the world a better place not just for this, but future generations.There is no leadership in the US, no vision, no drive. The excessive wealth has created a leading class that happily rests on the laurels of prior generations while squandering the future.This problem extends to all citizens, beyond the weak and needy, and permeates all levels of government from small to big.I live in one of the best school districts in the US, and when I see the food the children are served I am surprised this is acceptable.But this is what the US is, extract as much money from people while providing sub standard service.

It's not out of the realm of possibility that one side of a issue is not acting in good faith. If that's the case, compromise isn't really a viable option; trying to work with someone within a system doesn't work if they literally don't support the system itself. Obviously not everyone agrees that's what's happening here, but not everyone agrees with your premise that there's guaranteed to be some reasonable compromise to every possible issue either.In some ways, you're kind of arguing the same thing but in reverse by claiming that the comment you're responding to isn't being made in good faith. You're certainly entitled to hold that opinion, but only because of the exact same logic that entitles the parent commenter to hold the opinion that they express in the first place (and for what it's worth, I don't think it's actually being made in bad faith; not everyone will agree about where to draw the line, but at least to me it seems like we're long past the point of giving the benefit of the doubt on policies like the one described in TFA).replybee_rider 13 minutes ago

What does their perspective have to do with whether the distinction is real or not?It's a matter of logic and also a matter of what is most likely to be true. The language used is obviously in relation to the rather important legal dichotomy between those two things; victims of PFAS toxicity and their opinions are irrelevant. What does matter is what the executives and people making the decisions at the corporations knew, thought, and intended by doing certain things, like covering up studies that demonstrated the harms, continuing to ship products they suspected were harmful, or suing whistleblowers to keep them quiet about putative harms. The original commenter was insinuating (I've quoted it throughout this thread) that the corporations were intentionally poisoning people, as if making them sick was itself a motive for shipping these products. Whether that is true or not is to be determined from the mental state of the executives I just talked about. There is no evidence I've ever seen that any of the corporations, like Dupont or Marlboro, ever intended to poison people and give them diseases for some underlying profit motive. To suggest they had was, as I said, lazy thinking and a caricature.That certainly doesn't mean those corporations weren't negligent. But, as has been my point this entire time, intention is everything - intention is literally the entire difference between a murder charge and a manslaughter charge. It's not trivial at all.

> or they want people to get sick and die.This is the part I've been referring to from the original comment.Also, once again, you should be careful how you use intention here. Even in the case where they knew about the harms or the risk, you can't impute intention without more evidence. Without that evidence, you should stick to negligence, since that's what it would be and indeed that is what separates a simple negligence claim from criminal negligence (intention).If you say they intended to harm people or the environment, that's very different from saying their negligence or coverup resulted in harm to people/the environment. Intention is a subjective state of mind of the executives/board/'The company', and while it can be imputed in certain circumstances, it's a high bar. Dumping toxic waste somewhere because you think nobody will ever notice (which they did, in remote bodies of water), and then having some campers come along and jump into the water for a swim (which also happened), doesn't mean they intended to harm those campers or indeed that they intended to harm anyone. It was negligent but not obviously intentional. This really isn't hard to understand. It's also why there were never any criminal charges, not because the execs were long gone. In the US, corporations can be held criminally liable regardless of whether the original execs are still there or not.replycalifornical 46 minutes ago

I mean, if we're talking about intention then yes there's a huge difference, that's the entire point.But more to the point, your example is (as I'm sure you know) laughably simplistic.

Should we sell it anyway?'If you put it that way it isn't so obvious what the answer is. Most products have the potential to cause harm to some segment of the population. It's absolutely true that cigarettes and PFAS are two examples where the harms are much more rigorously established (especially with cigarettes, going back half a century), but the point stands: it's not a matter of chucking a chocolate bar at your dog. Again, you could plug the actual numbers in for the potential harms of PFAS and I don't think you'd be able to say that Dupont 'intended' to harm anybody, notwithstanding that they were clearly negligent.replythrance 1 hour ago

Any new regulation the EPA introduces results in litigation. Some of the previously introduced PFAS regulations weren't done in accordance with how the Safe Drinking Water Act says they should be (regulations were introduced without the necessary public consultation), so they're applying to partially vacate the previous ruling. Notably, they're _not_ applying to vacate the regulation of PFAS chemicals where they say the process was followed correctly.So, the legal reasoning might be to cut their losses litigating to defend rulings they think they'll lose due to the administrative error. I also suspect that being seen to roll back some regulations likely gives Lee Zeldin (the EPA admin) some political room to maneuver. He's historically be associated with anti-PFAS efforts (in Congress he represented a district with contamination problems and he voted for anti-PFAS legislation), but he's also part of an administration with a strong anti-regulation agenda, so he needs to walk a fine line.replynickysielicki 54 minutes ago

Democrats have represented center right positions since clinton.If anything, it's those centrist democrats that use purity tests as much as possible to eject the left from the party.As a good example of that, consider the case of Al Franken vs Andrew Cuomo.
Franken was pretty progressive, so when it came out that he had a picture in bad taste where he mocked squeezing boobs, gone.
24/7 news about how he's really a monster and the worst person in the world.Meanwhile, Cuomo has multiple credible allegations of sexual harassment and who does the party STILL back even after he lost the primary?

Frankly it read to me more like Harris had a totally moderate response that was blown up by the right as something she is a die hard believer in.

Republicans pass way more laws about trans people than democrats. Republicans raise way more money on trans people than democrats.

> They are too easily distracted by hot-button issues.I disagree.The issue is there's about 1000 fires burning all with somewhat critical importance.But further, the left and the politicians ostensibly representing the left simply are not aligned (at least in the US).
It's a rock and a hard place.
Generally the politicians positions are better than the right, but far less than what the left actually wants.
So they rely heavily on "what are you going to do, let the other guys win?".Meanwhile, the right has adopted nearly the opposite position.
On most positions when the base says "jump" they say "how high?".A big reason for that is money in politics.
What the rightwing base wants is generally pretty compatible with monied interests.
It's no skin off the nose of a rightwing politician if they want to ban books, that doesn't ultimately harm Disney's bottom dollar.For the left, what they want in almost all ways will negatively impact monied interested.
Better regulations makes rich polluters mad.
Nationalized healthcare makes every business (except maybe small businesses) mad.That's why "left" politicians tend to only support initiatives which effectively do nothing like recognizing a MLK or saying it's ok to be gay.
And even then, they are happy to ditch those positions to win more rightwing base support because, shocker, that rightwing base is likely to care less about their inaction on climate change.You are right, though, news is a big problem.
And that's because mainstream media is corporate captured.
That's why left policy positions no matter the channel are always framed in the absolute worst way possible.
For example, whenever nationalized healthcare comes up I can guarantee you the framing will be "How will you pay for this very expensive program that will eliminate choice and cost a lot of money which might make everyone sad and probably will bankrupt everyone?"replysupportengineer 1 hour ago

This has already been somewhat demonstrated; the conservatives spent decades undermining trust in news media and that led to the rise of assholes like Alex Jones and conspiracy theories becoming normalized by American conservatives.

The point of debate isn't to convince people, but to simply make somebody able to understand your ideas, and your point of view. In particular if you can't create a reasonable argument for something (even if you disagree with it), then you probably have never taken the time to try to understand it. And debate is a great playground for playing this out.And on the topic of changing minds - I think most of our decisions on what to believe are largely subconscious. Our minds process a vast number of things and then gradually push us in some direction, whether or not we want to go there. And so while I agree that debate will very rarely immediately convince anybody of anything, it becomes a part of that corpus of knowledge that your mind and subconscious are constantly processing.

I think this is the core of the issue for the Democra)ts. Conservative groups are focused on figuring out what actions are effective in gaining power and executing on that. They don't shy away from unethical methods like spreading misinformation and gerrymandering. They've understood this for a very long time and have been planting seeds for decades, such as taking over AM radio to entrench a conservative mindset in rural populations.From my observations the liberal and progressive groups seem to take on strategies where they claim the moral high ground and treat anyone not following their way of thinking as opponents and not as potential allies/converts. So even in cases where they are technically or morally "correct" in their stance, they aren't effective in bringing outsiders to their side. One example was the "recognize your (white) privilege" thing. While it was arguably based on sound ideas, proclaiming an entire demographic is receiving more than they earn is never going to bring people over to your side.I don't have much confidence that the Democrats will be able to turn things around in short order.

Bit of research suggests even counter top filters help, though with very wide range of opinions as to how much it helps and which PFAS it does work against (there are thousands)https://www.epa.gov/water-research/identifying-drinking-wate...replyllm_nerd 1 hour ago

They do, but the vast majority of fluids the average person consumes comes in products made elsewhere, along with restaurants, etc. So you can RO your home water, but unless you don't eat anything made elsewhere, water your own crops, etc, you need comprehensive protections to avoid them.replygigatexal 1 hour ago

Dear god.
Why is this administration actively trying to fuck everything up? Like, how does it hurt anyone to require companies to, you know, not fucking poison us?replysedawkgrep 1 hour ago

If you view all this through the lens of the goal of administration being to weaken the US both internally and as a world power, it all comes much more clearly into focus.Then it can be seen as no longer a disparate collection of seemingly random political, social, and economic moves, but rather as a directed, intentional movement.replytombert 1 hour ago

Still kind of baffles me that people voted for this, ostensibly to somehow lower grocery price by raising tariffs.Or, you know, they actually had really racist reasons and are using the grocery prices thing as an excuse.
Who's to say?replysedawkgrep 1 hour ago

I think it's much bigger than racism.Take a look at the administration's first term and all the involvement and ties (financial, political, etc.) there are to Russia (and Russian-related objectives like Ukraine).
It sounds bonkers, but the more you dig in and see how closely tied the relationships have been, and then see how totally soft Trump has been towards Putin/Russia - including direct actions towards Ukraine like removing the long-term diplomats, stopping weapons sales and aid, and recently killing USAID (whose #1 beneficiary was Ukraine) - it all coalesces into a single coherent view.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_between_Trump_associates...replytombert 1 hour ago

I have no doubt that the administration's motivation are weird and Russia-oriented.I was referring to the voters.
I think a lot of the voters claimed grocery prices were the reason, but a lot of them really wanted to get rid of Mexicans. Trump used a lot of racist rhetoric during all three of his campaigns.The fact that conservatives seem unwilling to condemn the president and ICE for detaining naturalized citizens indicates this to me.replysoared 1 hour ago

Dismantling the us in its current state would be a massive opportunity to gain more power/wealth/control/etc.Risk reward is dead simple. You’re already rich and powerful, you fail and become slightly less rich
and powerful. You succeed and have absolute control over the most powerful country in the worldreplytombert 1 hour ago

Sure but how much longer could it be the most powerful? There's a mass exodus of our scientists leaving to other countries where the funding is.I love America, and despite my wife being a naturalized citizen we are still tentatively looking to evacuate (basically determined by if the supreme court decides that the president can overturn the Fourteen Amendment with an executive order) because we are genuinely concerned that she might still be detained because of this administrations idiotic ICE quotas and overtly racist policies.You might argue that me leaving is no significant loss, and that's fair, but I am college and graduate educated, and I work in a technical field, and I doubt I'm the only one considering this.replypreisschild 1 hour ago

Ever since you were born, the factory bagging the food you eat have been lubricated with PFAS. Also perhaps youve seen the HDPE label on plastic food containers? That’s fluorinated. Basically everything is and always has been. It’s only recently there’s been a move to say hey this is probably bad for us. We can stop. But it’s expensive and there’s no good alternative so things are just going back to the way they always were.replymtoner23 1 hour ago

For those looking for the rest / other side of the story: the Trump EPA is actually the same EPA that established these PFAS rules to begin with. Municipal water associations have pushed back because they need more time to comply with some of the rules. EPA is responding to that, still adding additional requirements, but giving more time to comply with others.https://www.awwa.org/AWWA-Articles/epa-announces-changes-to-...replyavalys 2 hours ago
