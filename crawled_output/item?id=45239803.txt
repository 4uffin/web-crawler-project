I don't understand why the left puts up with it. They are too easily distracted by hot-button issues. These are some of the most important issues facing the present and future of our civilization and biosphere. I wish I had a solution, or knew the step to take. I suspect one of the root causes is the narrative, e.g. from news agencies, is being controlled by the propagators of the problem.replyspankalee 31 minutes ago

Our system is not set up to be able to resist things like this. Once one party has control over all three branches of the federal government, all we can do at the federal level is wait for elections.States can try to do some things in some cases, but the Supreme Court will get in the way and now the National Guard and Marines.replyclscott 4 minutes ago

The last time you voted in The United States of America may be the last time you get a vote in The United States of America.All three branches of The United States of America has been captured by a tyrannical government. Rights are being eroded for inhabitants of The United States of America, including its citizens.You have no right to: safe medicine, safe food, safe water, vote.The sooner the people recognize this and take action, the shorter it will be to reverse.Americans have a duty to act, and act quickly: what's already been taken will take generations to regain.replythomasmg 7 minutes ago

It does feel like this. I remember this moment clicking for me with my dads family who was typically more rational. "did you hear California is going to outlaw bacon now"; everyone laughs.I mention that sounds kind of click baity? look it up. California wants to impose more stringent minimum space standards for amimals bred to slaughter (prop 12). Seems maybe good, or at least worthy of a real discussion?But everyone had moved on by then, ironically to how much they care about animal rights (spending significant time volunteering in shelters and such).Its just too easy to dumb people down with memes.replyestearum 3 minutes ago

This is hogwash.The american left by and large is simply unrepresented.
Democrats have represented center right positions since clinton.If anything, it's those centrist democrats that use purity tests as much as possible to eject the left from the party.As a good example of that, consider the case of Al Franken vs Andrew Cuomo.
Franken was pretty progressive, so when it came out that he had a picture in bad taste where he mocked squeezing boobs, gone.
24/7 news about how he's really a monster and the worst person in the world.Meanwhile, Cuomo has multiple credible allegations of sexual harassment and who does the party STILL back even after he lost the primary?
He literally got endorsements from Democrats who shed tears because of the Al Franken photo.The same thing happened to Bernie Sanders.
The centrist dems and media started circulating garbage about how he was sexist over a comment he didn't make.replycardamomo 1 minute ago

Frankly it read to me more like Harris had a totally moderate response that was blown up by the right as something she is a die hard believer in. No one is dying on the hill of trans rights except for trans people as far as I see on the political stage. Republicans talk way more about trans people than democrats. Republicans pass way more laws about trans people than democrats. Republicans raise way more money on trans people than democrats. Democrats literally don’t seem to stand for anything as a unified force: government shutdowns over roe v wade overturn, start reading Epstein files into congressional record, refuse to cooperate with a single republican bill until they get some red meat for their base. I haven’t really seen anything and I’m not even particularly leftist. I just can’t imagine a single time democrats threw a massive shitfest for red meat, but I hear it nonstop in republican spaces.tyleo 1 minute ago

… did you see how many mainstream popular national politicians came out of the woodwork to support Cuomo despite being the less popular candidate by a significant amount? Did you catch the coordinated drop-out/endorsement of Clinton in 2016 which killed Sanders’ lead? Did you see all of the people in the party rushing to make an issue of Mamdani supporting Palestine in a race for mayor of NYC which is definitely neither Israel nor Palestine, and legally can’t even interact with those countries as a delegate of the US? Yes there is resistance to progressive candidates from the DNC leadership. No, it’s not a conspiracy theory.And you don’t have to look for second order effects to see how progressive issues poll — look at recent polls on Palestine, single-payer health care, housing affordability, and plenty of other progressive policies, by reputable non-partisan sources.Centrism is just as much of a political perspective as being anywhere else on the spectrum and can color political perspectives just as easily — it just biased in favor of the status quo so it’s got a much easier job.Blaming individual voters for voting ‘wrong’ is the first line of defense for people unwilling to take a hard look at the efficacy of the people that are supposed to be representing those voters.righthand 4 minutes ago

The "Palestine" issue is single-issue on the surface, but it is often used because it is a succint way to package a broad set of desired foreign policy changes: more cooperation with the Islamic world, less aggression/hegemony, and less money fed to insatiable MIC.Personally I do not see how we can afford to maintain the MIC for much longer, so these issues are very important to me.replyhypeatei 14 minutes ago

> They are too easily distracted by hot-button issues.I disagree.The issue is there's about 1000 fires burning all with somewhat critical importance.But further, the left and the politicians ostensibly representing the left simply are not aligned (at least in the US).
It's a rock and a hard place.
Generally the politicians positions are better than the right, but far less than what the left actually wants.
So they rely heavily on "what are you going to do, let the other guys win?".Meanwhile, the right has adopted nearly the opposite position.
On most positions when the base says "jump" they say "how high?".A big reason for that is money in politics.
What the rightwing base wants is generally pretty compatible with monied interests.
It's no skin off the nose of a rightwing politician if they want to ban books, that doesn't ultimately harm Disney's bottom dollar.For the left, what they want in almost all ways will negatively impact monied interested.
Better regulations makes rich polluters mad.
Nationalized healthcare makes every business (except maybe small businesses) mad.That's why "left" politicians tend to only support initiatives which effectively do nothing like recognizing a MLK or saying it's ok to be gay.
And even then, they are happy to ditch those positions to win more rightwing base support because, shocker, that rightwing base is likely to care less about their inaction on climate change.You are right, though, news is a big problem.
And that's because mainstream media is corporate captured.
That's why left policy positions no matter the channel are always framed in the absolute worst way possible.
For example, whenever nationalized healthcare comes up I can guarantee you the framing will be "How will you pay for this very expensive program that will eliminate choice and cost a lot of money which might make everyone sad and probably will bankrupt everyone?"replysupportengineer 24 minutes ago

Short of some January-6th style insurrection, I'm not entirely sure what "the left" [1] could actually "do" here. I am absolutely not advocating for a January-6th domestic terrorism event, I think that would be a very bad idea, but I also have no idea what we could actively do.It's easy to say "reject the news agencies", and sure that might be a good idea, but that carries the risk of "substituting bullshit with different, more dangerous bullshit".
This has already been somewhat demonstrated; the conservatives spent decades undermining trust in news media and that led to the rise of assholes like Alex Jones and conspiracy theories becoming normalized by American conservatives.
It's easy to say "well the left wouldn't do that", but you have no way of knowing that any better than I would.I don't want to be cynical or hopeless, but I genuinely have no idea what I could do to help fix any of the shit going on right now.[1]

| root | parent | next [–]
The point of debate isn't to convince people, but to simply make somebody able to understand your ideas, and your point of view. In particular if you can't create a reasonable argument for something (even if you disagree with it), then you probably have never taken the time to try to understand it. And debate is a great playground for playing this out.And on the topic of changing minds - I think most of our decisions on what to believe are largely subconscious. Our minds process a vast number of things and then gradually push us in some direction, whether or not we want to go there. And so while I agree that debate will very rarely immediately convince anybody of anything, it becomes a part of that corpus of knowledge that your mind and subconscious are constantly processing. And, in general, I think that can only be good - particularly for those most logically sound positions.Jaygles 10 minutes ago

I think this is the core of the issue for the Democrats. Conservative groups are focused on figuring out what actions are effective in gaining power and executing on that. They don't shy away from unethical methods like spreading misinformation and gerrymandering. They've understood this for a very long time and have been planting seeds for decades, such as taking over AM radio to entrench a conservative mindset in rural populations.From my observations the liberal and progressive groups seem to take on strategies where they claim the moral high ground and treat anyone not following their way of thinking as opponents and not as potential allies/converts. So even in cases where they are technically or morally "correct" in their stance, they aren't effective in bringing outsiders to their side.I don't have much confidence that the Democrats will be able to turn things around in short order.

It's not out of the realm of possibility that one side of a issue is not acting in good faith. If that's the case, compromise isn't really a viable option; trying to work with someone within a system doesn't work if they literally don't support the system itself. Obviously not everyone agrees that's what's happening here, but not everyone agrees with your premise that there's guaranteed to be some reasonable compromise to every possible issue either.In some ways, you're kind of arguing the same thing but in reverse by claiming that the comment you're responding to isn't being made in good faith. You're certainly entitled to hold that opinion, but only because of the exact same logic that entitles the parent commenter to hold the opinion that they express in the first place (and for what it's worth, I don't think it's actually being made in bad faith; not everyone will agree about where to draw the line, but at least to me it seems like we're long past the point of giving the benefit of the doubt on policies like the one described in TFA).replyspankalee 38 minutes ago

It is frustrating. Rolling back forever chemical regulations is analogous to reintroducing leaded gasoline. Should we be expected to debate and weigh the pros and cons of leaded gasoline?

We should err on the side of caution. An angry reaction against this is justified. It's insanity.replythrowaway173738 21 minutes ago

That’s the argument—yes. Consumers are supposed to educate themselves about all the industries in their backyard before buying a house to make sure that none of them have ever dumped PFAS in the last 100 years.

> or they want people to get sick and die.This is the part I've been referring to from the original comment.Also, once again, you should be careful how you use intention here. Even in the case where they knew about the harms or the risk, you can't impute intention without more evidence. Without that evidence, you should stick to negligence, since that's what it would be and indeed that is what separates a simple negligence claim from criminal negligence (intention).If you say they intended to harm people or the environment, that's very different from saying their negligence or coverup resulted in harm to people/the environment. Intention is a subjective state of mind of the executives/board/'The company', and while it can be imputed in certain circumstances, it's a high bar. Dumping toxic waste somewhere because you think nobody will ever notice (which they did, in remote bodies of water), and then having some campers come along and jump into the water for a swim (which also happened), doesn't mean they intended to harm those campers or indeed that they intended to harm anyone. It was negligent but not obviously intentional. This really isn't hard to understand. It's also why there were never any criminal charges, not because the execs were long gone. In the US, corporations can be held criminally liable regardless of whether the original execs are still there or not.replythrance 36 minutes ago

Any new regulation the EPA introduces results in litigation. Some of the previously introduced PFAS regulations weren't done in accordance with how the Safe Drinking Water Act says they should be (regulations were introduced without the necessary public consultation), so they're applying to partially vacate the previous ruling. Notably, they're _not_ applying to vacate the regulation of PFAS chemicals where they say the process was followed correctly.So, the legal reasoning might be to cut their losses litigating to defend rulings they think they'll lose due to the administrative error. I also suspect that being seen to roll back some regulations likely gives Lee Zeldin (the EPA admin) some political room to maneuver. He's historically be associated with anti-PFAS efforts (in Congress he represented a district with contamination problems and he voted for anti-PFAS legislation), but he's also part of an administration with a strong anti-regulation agenda, so he needs to walk a fine line.replycoliveira 57 minutes ago
