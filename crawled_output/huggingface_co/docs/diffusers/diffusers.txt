Diffusers Diffusers is a library of state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating videos, images, and audio. The library revolves around the DiffusionPipeline, an API designed for: easy inference with only a few lines of code flexibility to mix-and-match pipeline components (models, schedulers) loading and using adapters like LoRA Diffusers also comes with optimizations - such as offloading and quantization - to ensure even the largest models are accessible on memory-constrained devices. If memory is not an issue, Diffusers supports torch.compile to boost inference speed. Get started right away with a Diffusers model on the Hub today!
Learn If you‚Äôre a beginner, we recommend starting with the Hugging Face Diffusion Models Course. You‚Äôll learn the theory behind diffusion models, and learn how to use the Diffusers library to generate images, fine-tune your own models, and more. < > Update on GitHub
