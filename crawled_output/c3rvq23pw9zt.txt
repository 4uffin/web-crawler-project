Hearts head coach Derek McInnes believes his side gave a "90-minute performance" and deserved their victory at Ibrox.Asked if it was a statement win, he tells BBC Scotland: "It is an important win for us in terms of giving belief to a lot of the new lads and the lads who have been here a while who have been scarred by not winning at places at Ibrox."Everybody was making reference to our poor record here and it is good to put that to bed."People will focus on Rangers, but I thought we were bullish and confident and had a way about us in the first half."It is tough for Rangers at the minute and we wanted to add to that anxiety, so any opportunity to press them high and not let them build the way they want to play, we tried to take that."As for his two-goal captain, McInnes adds: "It was an absolute masterclass by Lawrence Shankland up front. He led the line brilliantly and was well supported behind - we were outstanding to a man."Image source, SNS

Dundee head coach Steven Pressley tells BBC Scotland: "First half was a poor performance, we didn't really carry out the game plan."The pleasing factor was we got a response from the players in the second half. My belief is we played with greater energy and courage."[Cameron Congreve] was a main target for us in the summer and we weren't sure if it was going to happen. Thankfully it did. He's shown what an exciting talent he is. He was exceptional today when he came on."

Falkirk manager John McGlynn: "Mixed emotions really. We competed and played very well. We've lost two cheap goals, but unfortunate with the deflection from the free kick."We switch off at the throw in, which has cost us. Throughout the game we matched St Mirren who are a very good side and very good at what they do."We're still finding our feet a little bit playing against teams at this level. So I take belief that for long spells you wouldn't have known we've just come out the Championship."We should probably have taken something from the game, so we need to learn very quickly that concentration levels have got to be spot on for every moment."

Livingston manager David Martindale tells BBC Scotland: "I thought it was a fantastic point away from home."I don't think the first half we were anywhere near the levels I wanted us to be."Second half we were much better, posed a threat on the counter."Jerome didn't really have a save to make. We could have nicked it, so I'm fairly pleased with the performance."I thought the full group were very good. A special mention to Jerome and the back four. There was a lot to like."We've got good team spirit, positive momentum and I think we'll get better as the season goes on."

Aberdeen manager Jimmy Thelin tells BBC Scotland: "We feel some frustration. We did some more stable things today, kept a clean sheet and create a lot of chances. It's still not there, we still have things to work on. It's not good enough and we have to keep working hard to get the team up to speed. "The good thing today was the chances we created. When we play at home, we have to be quicker as a team. That's why we have to work really hard to get the team up to their full potential."Four players today make their first game of the season and made a good impact."I think we are going to succeed. It is a long-term project, we're going to keep going, but right now we have to show more. It's up to us to give the fans energy. We have to give them more."As a player and a manager at Aberdeen, we have really strong expectations. We have to give the fans more to get a good feeling. Right now, the team is struggling a little bit. "The pressure is always there. We have had a really bad start, but we have to keep working and keep believing. The only way to get out of this is take it step by step."This season is not over yet. We know we don't have enough points so far. We have to perform better."

St Mirren manager Stephen Robinson told BBC Scotland: "The game was sticky at the start, both teams after the international break and days off, looked rusty."But we came out really well in the second half and dominated the game. But for the goalkeeper, Scott Bain, who has made two terrific saves from Killian Phillips and Richard King, it could and should have been more."Then we concede a goal we should never concede and gives Falkirk a little bit of hope. We had to defend, and did it well when we needed to."We can be better than today in terms of the quality we can show. But we said grind out the result whatever way, and we did."Robinson says the injury to Marcus Fraser is a "concering one". The ever-present defender was forced off with an ankle injury just before the break.Image source, SNS

Motherwell manager Jens Berthel Askou tells BBC Scotland: "We play probably one if the best halves of my time here, then by far the worst one in the second half. "We have everything under control. Then the entire team is completely sleeping on a set play. That's unacceptable because there was time to set up and do much better. "Totally our own fault we don't have the win today. We didn't deserve it, although we had a few good chances, but so did they."We have to perform better. We have to take these moments and really look after them."
