Another chance for St Mirren captain Mark O'Hara.Jayden Richardson gets to the line and floats a cross in, Mikael Mandron chests it down and lays it to O'Hara, who side-foots it over.The rain is biblical in Falkirk right now.

Dundee look a different team now and so much of that is down to substitute Cameron Congreve, who dips in from the left and hits straight at the keeper.

St Mirren should be in front. A ball is drilled right across the face of the Falkirk goal and just needs a player in black to tap it into the net.Neither of their two strikers are there, though.

The pie of the month is the only reason to go to Pittodrie - steak, black pudding and peppercorn sauce. Stan

A diving Simon Murray header almost turns this one around completely, but it's narrowly off target.

Martin is deluded, heard him say before the game âwe are in a good place at the momentâ - what after a draw at home with an awful Celtic team? Sack him, he is an embarrassment!BrianWhen are the 49ers going to realise they made a gigantic error and get rid of Martin? If they don't Ibrox is going to be empty.GaryMartin surely has to go. If you donât have the players to play the way you want you have to adapt. He isnât being a manager heâs being a dictator. You canât force players to play in a way that they clearly canât.LeeSeeing as Rangers have given Martin more than enough chances, they obviously will be happy to employ anyone. Can someone pass my details on to the board at Ibrox as I fancy the job next? Graham

Half-time change for Dundee as Joe Westley makes way for Cameron Congreve.

Andy Winter is on for Lewis Smith for Livingston. Unsure if that's tactical or enforced.

This has been a really accomplished display from Hearts. They look like they have real clarity about what they're doing, that they deserve to be top of the table and have got almost every aspect of this spot on.None of that applies to Rangers. Overall, this has been abject with players looking like they're not sure what to do at times. Slow, ponderous and perfect for their opponents.It's as poor a 45 minutes as they've produced in this campaign and that couldn't have come at worse time for Russell Martin.Yet more boos, extremely loud ones, from the Rangers support greeted that half-time whistle. The pressure is well and truly on.Image source, SNSImage caption, Hearts head coach Derek McInnes must be pleased with what he's seen at Ibrox

We're miles off where we need to be and are short on players but, the players that are here know what we want and it's just getting that across in training and then games. I'm predicting Steven Pressley's after match comments. JimThree-way battle for relegation between Dundee Rangers and Aberdeen.
We're at home to Motherwell and giving them 70% possession. At what stage do players ignore instructions and take the initiative and just play football?!AnonymousThe Well are playing some fantastic controlled stuff. We need to put this game to bed. Itâs a pleasure watching Motherwell again after years and years of dire turgid long ball bypass the midfield. Keep it going!FraserAnother cracking goal for Tawanda Maswanhise. Need a few more.Adam

It doesn't look like St Mirren boss Stephen Robinson is enjoying his 400th outing as a manager very much.His side have only manged two goals from their first four and a half games. The one they got at Easter Road last time out was pretty fortunate too since a free-kick bounced off Miguel Freckleton and in.Image source, SNS
