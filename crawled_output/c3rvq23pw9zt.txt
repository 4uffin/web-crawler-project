Ivan Dolcek has been hugely impressive today but that is a contender for worst free-kick of the 20th Century as he drills the ball straight out of play from near the byeline.

Vicko Sevelj is the latest player to be booked. Not entirely sure what for. There's just so much going on!

We've got 25 minutes plus stoppage time to go.Jordan Smith makes an incredible spreading save to deny Iurie Iovu from close in but the big United defender had strayed offside.

Vicko Sevelj tries to hammer one in from a tight angle and Jordan Smith needs a strong hand to push the shot to safety.

Josh Mulligan, now playing right wing-back for Hibs, drives forward and is brought down by Amar Fatah.

Yevhen Kucherenko is at full-stretch to pat away a dipping effort from Jamie McGrath.The United keeper has really played well since that own goal.

Hibs' Josh Mulligan is maybe a bit unlucky to see yellow after a collision with WIll Ferry.Free-kick to United in a dangerous position, but Vicko Sevelj uses an arm to try and control the ball as it breaks his way.

Kieron Bowie has a go with a dipping volley but this one goes flying wide.He did score an absolute belter against Partizan Belgrade, so why not try and replicate it?

The decision is overturned after a VAR review.Josh Mulligan does well to force the mistake near the penalty box and Kieron Bowie did the rest with a deft touch and a thunderous finish.

Lovely footwork from Kieron Bowie as he skips past his man and slams home.A flag is up though.He's not offside. Was there a foul in the build-up?

It's been a cracking game so far and the message from both managers is likely to be 'more of the same'.Hibs boss David Gray would like a more clinical edge in front of goal though.United have shown their threat on the counter and the home side are going to leave a few more gaps as they try to get back into this one.

Just watching replays of that second United goal. Does Jordan Smith really need to come rushing out to confront Ivan Dolcek? Hard to blame the keeper when the defence has left him so exposed.

The visitors lead at Easter Road in a game packed full of goalmouth action.Hibs have had 13 shots to United's four but needed a terrible own goal from goalkeeper Yevhen Kucherenko to make it 1-1.Luca Stephenson headed United in front from their first attack and Zac Sapsford had an easy tap-in after the Hibs defence went walkabout just before half-time.Kucherenko has made two good saves to deny Kieron Bowie after his error.
