This is good stuff from Derek McInnes' side. A couple of decent chances already and they seem to be in control of the ball, getting up the pitch regularly.Not the start this home crowd were looking for. Not at all.

There's such anticipation inside Ibrox.Rangers simply need a win after four opening league draws. Anything else will ramp the negativity up to new levels and this arena could be far from welcoming for Russell Martin and these players.Nico Raskin's situation looms large. A win will dampen that for now but anything less than three points and it'll be one of the first things home supporters raise in objection.It couldn't be more different for Hearts. A strong start to the season has created the chance to go nine points clear of their opponents and go clear at the top of the table before Celtic's trip to Kilmarnock on Sunday.They don't win here often, but come with confidence, knowing full well the pressure Rangers are under.

Rangers are not the only side to have started with four draws. Motherwell and Kilmarnock have done the same.No team has opened the campaign with five draws since Opta started keeping an eye on such things in 1998-99.

Rangers head coach Russell Martin hopes to build on the goalless draw with Celtic and benefit from extra time on the training pitch during the international window."The windows shut, so the squad's settled, we have new signings and we have a squad we are really happy with - good depth, good options, good versatility and back off a performance full of aggression, loads of togetherness and loads of fight and now we have to add the other bits today," he tells BBC Scotland.Asked how he can appease his critics among the fans, Martin adds: "We just have to win football matches - as simple as that. We are trying to build something that is sustainable and helps us over a period of time at a club that demands instance success - and today is a good day to start."We have to be competing for the title this year. It is difficult test today. They [Hearts] have started this season well, but we want to play the way we want to play and the crowd can help us do that."

Falkirk manager John McGlynn told BBC Scotland: "It's been a bit stop-start at the moment with the international break and League Cup games."But we're happy to be here and happy with the team but they know they need to be on their toes with the new players we've brought in. "We have a lot of injuries as well, but we've got a good squad. St Mirren are a good side, they've had tough fixtures. Stephen Robinson's done an amazing job there."They are the template for ourselves, they went up in 2018 and been there ever since. It would be great for us to be able to do that, that's the target."Image source, SNS

St Mirren manager Stephen Robinson reflected on reaching his 400th game as a manager."It surprised me to be honest," he told BBC Scotland. "I think you look at stuff like that when you finish your career, and hopefully I'm far from finished. It's a tribute to the staff and players I've worked with."We've only lost one game in 15, which makes it easier [to pick the same team]. We've had a tough start to the season, playing the top three from last year."It's about turning those draws now into wins."Image source, SNS

Motherwell manager Jens Berthel Askou tells BBC Scotland: "We have a few players unavailable, they've picked up some injuries during the last couple of weeks. We're still assessing them."Eli [Just] arrived yesterday after a long journey and playing many minutes. That gives an opportunity to some of the guys who have been working hard to get up to speed."We don't need to keep a clean sheet to win, but it'll make it easier. For a long time we were very hard to score against, then there were a few games we were a bit too open in."That's what we've been working on, to adjust and sharpen up. I hope it will result in a clean sheet today."Image source, SNS
