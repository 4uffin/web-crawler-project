Hibs' next outing is away to Rangers in the Premier Sports Cup.If they tighten up in defence and still carry anywhere near the same threat in attack, then they will fancy making it an Edinburgh double at Ibrox.

Hibs had 27 efforts on goal, with 12 on target. United weren't far behind with nine on target from 13 attempts.Both sides really went for it. There will be a lot of tired legs in the dressing rooms.

It was quite a day for Yevhen Kucherenko.The United keeper knocked in a horrible own goal then made a string of fabulous saves.He was jittery on crosses and that led to the stramash from which Hibs earned a penalty and Vicko Sevelj got his marching orders.Image source, SNS

The points are shared in a thriller.Hibs will be happy to have come back from two goals down but that's three home games without a win.With one win, the Edinburgh side stay third as Dundee United drop one place to fifth in a very congested table.
