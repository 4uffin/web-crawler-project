Thatâs St Mirren off the mark in terms of Premiership victories in season 2025-26, and Mikael Mandronâs fifth goal of the campaign proved to be the match-winner.Brian Grahan might have made a strong pitch to start the next Bairns game by scoring late to give Falkirk hope, but the hosts fell short of completing a comeback.They now wait until a week on Tuesday to face Hibernian, while St Mirren are in action sooner in a League Cup quarter-final against Kilmarnock.

The majority of conversation will focus on Rangers who are in absolute turmoil right now. This was a terrible afternoon for Russell Martin, there's no doubt.However, what an incredible outcome for Hearts who showed, for long, long spells, a real maturity and tactical nous. They were excellent.The home fans seem to have made their mind up on Martin going by the angry reaction inside this stadium. It's turned into a nightmare and the vast majority have undoubtedly turned on him.Rangers are in a state of utter disarray right now.Image source, SNS

Todayâs result at Ibrox shows that Rangers appointed the wrong manager. Derek McInnes is Rangers through and through and knows the Scottish game. I canât understand why he has never been given the opportunity. JayI said it after the first game of the season how worried I was about Russell Martin's appointment and how long a season it's going to be. Sadly, I've been proven correct and if he isn't sacked tonight or tomorrow, the crowds will start dropping and the players confidence will get even lower if that's possible. Lawrence Shankland should have been our first signing and not just because of today. He would have been a great signing and knows how to play in Scotland. Martin out please.BazObviously buzzing with a rare old win at Ibrox, but it feels like it's been played on semi-pro difficulty. Rangers are seriously bad. So exciting to be a Hearts fan just now though!Calum

While Hearts enjoy the air at the top of the Premiership pile, Rangers sit 10th.Yes, 10th after four draws and a defeat.Hearts have won four and drawn one to move nine points clear of the Ibrox side.

It's rather depressing as far as the Aberdeen fans are concerned.They haven't produced anything close to a real opportunity. What a poor start to the season. Livingston have been well-organised and disciplined.
