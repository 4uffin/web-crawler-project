I am rewriting a Python utility for AI analysis of changes in a git repository in C++, but I encountered a problem creating a setup.exe installation file in CMake and couldn't find a solution on the internet.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 4.0)
project(HelloWorld VERSION 1.0.0)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
add_executable(HelloWorld main.cpp)
include(InstallRequiredSystemLibraries)
install(TARGETS HelloWorld DESTINATION bin)
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME "HelloWorld")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR "MyCompany")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY "Description HelloWorld")
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
set(CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY "HelloWorld")
set(CPACK_GENERATOR "NSIS")
set(CPACK_NSIS_DISPLAY_NAME "HelloWorld Example")
set(CPACK_NSIS_CONTACT "[email protected]")
set(CPACK_NSIS_MODIFY_PATH ON)
set(CPACK_NSIS_MENU_LINKS
"bin/HelloWorld.exe" "Start HelloWorld"
"Uninstall.exe" "Delete HelloWorld"
)
include(CPack)

There is only your script... but no error messages, no debug information can you please add those? And what source/online help did you use to come up with this cmake file?

Wouldn't it be more natural/flexible on Windows to create a MSI installer rather than a .exe?
