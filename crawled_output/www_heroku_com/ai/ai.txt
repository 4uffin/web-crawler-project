I was able to get access to using Heroku Managed Inference and Agents and ‘boom’ I’ve got a model running immediately that I can attach to my app and instantly start interacting with and it uses the OpenAI APIs. So all the existing SDKs just work. It saves me so much time and headache. So I can now go and actually run some of these experiments that are critical for some of our new products.
