Sept 10 - by David Baliles
Improve your security model with Heroku AppLink, a managed bridge between Salesforce and Heroku that improves risk and governance.
Model Context Protocol (MCP) on HerokuSeamlessly integrate external tools and data sources to enhance model capabilities and build sophisticated AI agents.Get Started with MCP on Heroku
Bring context & control to your AI applicationsWhether you’re building intelligent agents, automating workflows, or integrating external services, Heroku gives you the foundation to do it securely, at scale, and with developer-first simplicity.MCP (Model Context Protocol) on Heroku gives developers a standardized way to integrate external tools, services, and real-time data into their AI applications. With MCP, you can build context-aware agents that reason, act, and interact with your APIs—securely and reliably—using the same trusted developer workflow that Heroku is known for.
How MCP powers agentic workflows on Heroku
Standardized tool integrationMCP provides a consistent way for language models to discover, understand, and invoke external tools and APIs, regardless of the underlying model provider.
Contextual awarenessModels gain access to relevant real-time data and functionalities, enabling more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware responses.
Build agentic AI applications with Heroku MCP Toolkits
Build agentic applications seamlesslyMCP provides the framework to create AI agents that interact with your application’s logic, external APIs, and other Heroku services. Design complex workflows where models can reason and act within your Heroku environment.
Simplified tool integrationDefine tools using a simple schema. Heroku handles the MCP connections, allowing your models (via the Heroku Managed Inference and Agents add-on) to easily discover and invoke databases, microservices, or third-party APIs hosted on or off Heroku.
Secure & controlled executionLeverage Heroku’s trusted infrastructure. Define precisely what actions your AI agents can perform, ensuring tool execution happens within the secure and managed context of your Heroku application and dynos.
Integrated developer workflowDefine, test, and manage your MCP tools alongside your application code. Utilize the Heroku CLI and platform tools for a familiar development experience when building agentic capabilities.
