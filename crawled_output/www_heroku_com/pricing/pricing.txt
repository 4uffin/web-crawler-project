Artificial Intelligence new Heroku Managed Inference and Agents
Docs
Specs
Heroku Managed Inference and Agents empowers developers to rapidly integrate cutting-edge AI capabilities into their applications without the complexities of managing underlying AI infrastructure. This means accelerating AI adoption, reducing “delivery gaps” for AI solutions, and democratizing AI application development, ultimately leading to faster time to market and significant cost savings by minimizing the need for specialized AI/ML operations expertise.Developers gain access to a curated set of large language models (LLMs), embedding models for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and diffusion models for image generation. Additionally, developers can use MCP servers (powered by one-off dynos that follow a pay-as-you-go model) to extend AI model capabilities, enabling AI-powered automation and tool execution within Heroku’s trusted environment.
