Heroku gives you simple, easy ways to…
DeployHeroku analyzes your code, handling dependencies, compilation, and optimizations which ensures the application is ready to run in a dyno—a lightweight, isolated Linux container. This makes it easier for developers to focus on writing code, rather than deployment and environment configuration.
ManageManage your .NET applications through the Heroku Dashboard or CLI. Built-in monitoring gives you insights into memory, CPU usage, and request throughput, helping you optimize performance effortlessly. Avoid the hidden costs and distractions of managing servers or IaaS plumbing by letting Heroku manage it for you.
ScaleEasily scale app resources with a single click or command as your app gains traction. Heroku’s auto-scaling feature enables your apps to scale at the pace of your business, supporting apps of all sizes, from small-scale projects to high-traffic production services, handling over 65 billion requests per day.
