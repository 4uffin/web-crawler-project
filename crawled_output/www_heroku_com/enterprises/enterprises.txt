Deliver strategic enterprise apps with confidence and controlFor the traditional enterprise, apps have become a strategic imperative in order to stay competitive in today’s digital world. However, large engineering organizations are optimized to run legacy processes and systems that are core to the business, and do not always support fast, agile app development.Heroku is a cloud-based platform as a service (PaaS) that gives your enterprise the quickest path to delivering modern apps that are strategic for your business. Heroku’s managed service takes care of hardware and infrastructure concerns, so your team can focus on building apps that differentiate your business. In addition, Heroku offers a host of features that are tailored to meet the needs of large organizations and high-volume apps, providing enterprise-grade auditing, support, and scale.Enterprise-grade security and scaleTo meet strict security and compliance requirements, Heroku gives you the option to run your apps in a dedicated runtime environment. This enhances protection of your sensitive data and transactions, and enables your apps to communicate with each other over a private network. Stable outbound IPs allow you to securely securely connect apps to your corporate systems or third-party cloud services. Your dedicated runtime also ensures that even your highest traffic apps deliver low latency performance for every user.
Network-isolated runtimesHeroku Private Spaces offer dedicated runtime environments for enhanced privacy, power, and performance. This enables your Heroku apps to securely connect to on-premise systems on your corporate network or cloud services, such as Salesforce.
Team collaborationHeroku Teams helps you bring distributed development teams into shared app workspaces. Heroku Flow provides collaboration tools and workflows to deliver higher quality apps, faster through continuous delivery and continuous integration.
Fine-grained access controlManage your app project’s team members, processes, and billing, including app-level permissions from a centralized, unified dashboard. Heroku gives enterprise project leaders the agility they need to drive accountability throughout the development cycle.
Salesforce integrationHeroku Connect allows you to bidirectionally synchronise data between your Salesforce deployments and your Heroku apps, extending the capabilities of both. Build apps that utilize Salesforce data, or build Salesforce apps and processes that utilize Heroku data.
Secure, trusted platformHeroku’s resilient, scalable, and managed runtime stack allows you to run your strategic apps in production with confidence. A view into the current platform status and any recent issues is always available.
Enterprise-grade supportSalesforce Success Plans are available to help you design solutions, troubleshoot issues and ensure your apps run smoothly. Salesforce Success Plans offer faster escalation for critical issues.
Fast app delivery, short cyclesThe Heroku Platform enables your teams to deliver apps as fast as they can build them. Easily prototype ideas, build tools for internal stakeholders, or deploy a digital interface that transforms engagement with customers or partners.
Simplified DevOpsWith a fully-managed platform, Heroku’s staff monitors uptime, performance, and infrastructure concerns, freeing your app development team from the burden of hardware and operations management.
Seamless scalabilityEasily scale your apps in a single click or command with no downtime using the Heroku Dashboard or CLI. The platform’s autoscaling feature allows you to automatically scale apps with increased usage.
Integrated data servicesHeroku’s managed data services are optimized for developers, making it even easier to build data-driven apps. Choose Heroku Postgres, Heroku Key-Value Store, and Apache Kafka on Heroku, or third-party add-on services.
