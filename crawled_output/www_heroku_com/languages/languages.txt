Securing Salesforce Integrations with Heroku AppLink
Sept 10 - by David Baliles
Improve your security model with Heroku AppLink, a managed bridge between Salesforce and Heroku that improves risk and governance.
Language SupportLearn which programming languages Heroku supports, and how you can enable hundreds more.Get Started Now
Heroku is for languagesWe built Heroku, our fully managed container-based cloud platform, to make it easy for you to run apps written in a variety of programming languages, including first-class support for .NET, Python, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Go, Scala, and Clojure. Languages are at the heart of what we do — because the languages we support are at the heart of your applications.
Heroku is for choiceHeroku is polyglot—we embrace all languages. Whether you’re part of a team or company built around a single language, a large enterprise using several languages across the board, or a startup building a complex microservice architecture utilizing multiple languages, your apps will be at home here.
Languages with first-class supportThe following programming languages receive first-class support on Heroku. This means our dedicated language specialists constantly work at ensuring that the latest language versions, language frameworks and other language features are maintained, patched and fully supported on Heroku.
Node.jsBuild front end apps, back end apps, or a combination of both with common Node.js frameworks and libraries like Express, Fastify, React, Ember.js, Vue and more.
RubyWhether you prefer frameworks like Sinatra or Rails, or getting your hands dirty with Unicorn or WebSocket, or using the MRI or JRuby, Heroku’s rock-solid Ruby support delivers.
JavaBuild microservices with Groovy and Ratpack, web apps with minimal fuss using Spark, and high performance web apps with Spring Boot/Spring Cloud, using a range of JDKs.
PHPPush your code, and let Heroku handle the details – with automatic installation of the PHP version and extensions that your app needs, support for your favorite frameworks, web servers that “just work”, and trivial scalability.
PythonWhether you’re building with frameworks like Django or FastAPI, or crunching data with NumPy, Heroku stays out of the way. Easily deploy anything from bespoke microservices to complex, database-backed web apps.
GoWhether you prefer Go’s stdlib, or frameworks like Negroni and Gin, Heroku gets out of the way, letting you build and deploy network services, microservices and high-traffic API endpoints, easily, and scalably.
ScalaTake your Scala solutions, whether microservices built with Finagle, or full-stack solutions built with Play, and combine them deploy it to the cloud, adding to them any of our integrated add-on services such as Treasure Data, Neo4j or Cassandra.
ClojureBuild and deploy Leiningen-based applications with ease, whether they’re micro-services built on libraries like Ring and Compojure, more complete solutions based on Luminus and Pedestal, or front-end apps using ClojureScript and Om.
.NET
Build and deploy applications in C#, F#, and Visual Basic, using frameworks like ASP.NET Core and Blazor, all with the simplicity and flexibility of the Heroku platform.
Supporting other languages via BuildpacksSupport for a language is enabled via Buildpacks, scripted build processes that let Heroku’s polyglot systems handle any language for which a Buildpack exists. You can use any Buildpack contributed by our community, or roll your own.
BuildpacksPart of the Elements Marketplace, buildpacks developed by the Heroku community let you extend the polyglot Heroku platform in any number of directions. Choose from over 1200 custom-built buildpacks.
ExtensibilityIf you can’t find what you’re looking for, or you need to customize an existing buildpack, use Heroku’s open Buildpack API to support the language of your choice, in your way.
