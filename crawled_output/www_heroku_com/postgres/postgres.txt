Heroku Managed PostgreSQLSQL database as a service for all developers.Get Started Now
PostgreSQL as a Service from HerokuHeroku Postgres is a managed PostgreSQL database service that delivers the world’s most advanced open source database as a trusted, secure, and scalable service that is optimized for developers. Using Heroku’s PostgreSQL as a service, developers can build engaging, data-driven apps while relying on our expertise and fully managed platform to build, operate, secure, and validate compliance for their data stack.View Docs Heroku Postgres PlansWhy Heroku Postgres?
Heroku’s operational experience applied to dataHeroku’s expertise comes from running Postgres in the cloud for over 12 years and operating millions of data stores today. We have engineers on call to help debug and restore with 24x7x365 support, as well as product managers engaged in your use cases and needs. This frees you to focus on delivering more value from your data while our managed PostgreSQL experts take care of uptime, maintenance, and performance.
Scale on demandPeaks and valleys in demand are business as usual for data-driven apps. With Heroku Postgres, handling them is simple. Our managed PostgreSQL fleet responds swiftly to your apps’ changing traffic patterns, seamlessly scaling up and down according to your database resource requirements.
Do more with your dataAs a comprehensive postgreSQL as a service, Heroku Postgres allows you to focus on getting the most out of your data without the admin overhead. Follower instances and database forks turn your data into an agile resource that’s available for safe experimentation with alternative use cases. Instances dedicated to analytics, new data strategies, development instances, and data warehousing are ready to go in just a few clicks.
Secure & compliantThe Heroku platform is built for security from the ground up in compliance with key ​industry standards​ for data protection. For apps in regulated industries, ​Heroku Shield Postgres​ delivers PCI and HIPAA compliance. As threats evolve, our DevOps team takes care of patching and security configuration so you can focus on building your app. Where data is particularly sensitive, you can bring your own encryption key to ensure its safety.

Managed database as a service tools to unleash your data
ForksForking a database is just like forking source code. Perfectly clone your database with a single command. Test new schema migrations by simply forking your production database and running the new migrations against the fork. Load test by forking and running your testing environment against it.
FollowersFollowers​ are read-only replicas of your databases that stay up-to-date with changes and can be queried. Traditionally, setting up and maintaining replication is a difficult and specialized task. But with followers, it just works. Followers provide horizontal scalability by distributing database read traffic.
DataclipsSharing data insights doesn’t have to involve complex dashboards or analytics tools. Using Dataclips​, anyone on your team who’s familiar with SQL can easily create reports against live production data, and securely share the results with anyone using a unique URL.
Trusted data integrationHeroku’s managed database as a service can serve as the heart of a multi-cloud architecture. Move data securely between Postgres and resources in AWS via PrivateLink​ or between public clouds and private data centers with ​mutual TLS.​ Sync data seamlessly with Salesforce using Heroku Connect​.
Managed PostgreSQL for Data security & protection
Continuous protection
Heroku Postgres automatically ensures data integrity with our unique continuous protection ​feature. Every write is automatically replicated to highly-durable storage in multiple data centers. Should a failure happen, rebuilding a live database takes minutes.
Straightforward rollbacks
A dropped table or failed migration needn’t be a disaster. With a single command, the ​rollback feature​ allows you to create a new database instance that’s restored from a point before the problem occurred.
Automated health checksHeroku’s automated health checks monitor your databases around the clock, with the status of the entire fleet under the eyes of our managed PostgreSQL experts. When an issue arises, our automated processes restore your database to health.
High availability
Maintain ​high availability​ of your data with ​Heroku Postgres Premium, Private, and Shield plans​. Should your database instance become unavailable, Heroku Postgres automatically replaces it with a standby.
Security and complianceAt Heroku, trust is our number one value. To further strengthen our trust with customers, we regularly perform audits and maintain PCI, HIPAA, ISO, and SOC ​compliance​.
Data encryption
Encrypt data ​using your own key​ to ensure that you control who has access. You can block access from anyone, at any time, by revoking the key, giving you full control and custody of your sensitive data.
Heroku Postgres via mutual TLSYou can seamlessly integrate Heroku Postgres in a Private or Shield Space with external resources running in public clouds and private data centers over a mutually-authenticated, secure, and compliant mutual TLS connection.
Heroku Dataclips
“Heroku’s expertise with Postgres and Redis means that we can take on more customers without having to pause and think about how to handle the increase in demand on our data layer.”
