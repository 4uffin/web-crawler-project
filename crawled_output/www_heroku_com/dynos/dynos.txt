Securing Salesforce Integrations with Heroku AppLink
Sept 10 - by David Baliles
Improve your security model with Heroku AppLink, a managed bridge between Salesforce and Heroku that improves risk and governance.
Heroku Dynos: Lightweight Containers for Running AppsGet Started Now
Dynos: the heart of the Heroku platformApp developers rely on software abstractions to simplify development and enhance productivity. When it comes to running apps, containerization abstracts away the burden of managing hardware or virtual machines. Instead of hardware management, you deploy an app to Heroku, which packages the app’s code and dependencies into containers — lightweight, isolated environments that provide compute, memory, an OS, and an ephemeral filesystem. Containers are typically run on a shared host, yet are completely isolated from each other.The Heroku Platform uses the container model to run and scale all Heroku apps. The containers used at Heroku are called “dynos.” Dynos are isolated, virtualized Linux containers that are designed to execute code based on a user-specified command. Your app can scale to any specified number of dynos based on its resource demands. Heroku’s container management capabilities provide you with an easy way to scale and manage the number, size, and type of dynos your app may need at any given time.Dynos are the building blocks that power any Heroku app, from simple to sophisticated. Deploying to dynos, and relying on Heroku’s dyno management, makes it easy for you to build and run flexible, scalable apps – freeing you from managing infrastructure, so you can focus on building and running great apps.

Learn more about how dynos work on Heroku
Buildtime: preparing code to run in a dynoHeroku automates the build process, from the initial deploy to producing a “slug” – ready to be pushed to a dyno.
Runtime: configuring process and dyno typesDevelopers can optimize their app at runtime by breaking it down into different “process types” that determine what code runs in different dynos.
The dyno lifecycleHeroku manages the dynos, and cycles dynos to maintain the health of all apps and the overall system.
Scaling apps with dynosWhen an app needs to scale, Heroku makes it easy to change a dyno formation instantly.
Dynos in Heroku Private SpacesHigh performance dynos in Private Spaces communicate directly with each other over a private network.
“Heroku makes managing scale incredibly easy. When we’re getting a spike in traffic, we don’t have to spin up a bunch of new servers, we simply add more dynos.”
