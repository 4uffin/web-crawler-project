Validate a globed-like path

I am writing a API for a program. The program has a native support of "globed" paths such as img-0*.png. I would like to know how to be sure that there is at least a file satisfying that pattern, a kind of is_globable(path) method.
path = 'img-0*.png'
if os.path.isfile(path):
pass
elif is_globable(path):
pass
else:
raise Exception(...)
Neither glob or pathlib provide such a functionality.
The most related method I found is pathlib.PurePath.full_match but solves the opposite problem.

yes, for example. Even img-0?.png and other combinations. I want to know a way to validate globed-paths

Actually, this can be done using the glob library using glob.glob:
path = 'img-0*.png'
def is_globable(path):
return glob.glob(path)
if os.path.isfile(path):
pass
elif is_globable(path):
pass
else:
raise Exception(...)
Here are the docs:

Why bother calling bool()?
glob.glob() returns a list, and lists already evaluate as "falsey" (an empty list) or "truthy" (a list containing at least one item).

Using the iterator form, glob.iglob.
For sake of completeness I recall its full signature:
glob.iglob(pathname, *, root_dir=None, dir_fd=None, recursive=False, include_hidden=False)
It is based on os.scandir and fnmatch.fnmatch to walk the tree and filter the names.
It also support the
? single character,
* for any characters with 0 or more repetitions and
[] for grouping
in both basename and directories.
Example of path: ./images-*/doc-00[4-7]_?.png
from glob import iglob
def is_globable(path):
return bool(next(iglob(path), False))
