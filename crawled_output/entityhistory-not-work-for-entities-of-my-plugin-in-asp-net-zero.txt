I am developing some APIs using Web.Host project of ASP.NET Zero as my startup project.
I have created plugin projects same as projects of ASP.NET Zero, like this: My.Plugin.Core, My.Plugin.Core.Shared, My.Plugin.Application, My.Plugin.Application.Shared, My.Plugin.EntityFrameworkCore, ...
All my changes are inside these projects and DLLs will be loaded in ASP.NET Zero as plugins. **It uses its own database and DBContext **and entities are defined in core project.
I want to enable EntityHistory for entities of my plugin. I have enabled EntityHistory globally and added my entity names to EntityHistoryHelper and uncommented related lines but nothing is inserted into AbpEntityChange tables in database of ASP.NET Zero.
Also I tried to add AbpEntityChange tables in my plugin database and added them to my plugin dbcontext, but still it doesnt work.
I think having a separate DbContext from ASP.NET Zero DbContext is making the problem, because changes are in plugin DbContext and AbpEntityChange tables are in ASP.NET Zero DbContext.
