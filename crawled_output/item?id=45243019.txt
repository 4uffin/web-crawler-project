> The Flexibility of Renting Is UndervaluedAnd the stability of buying is undervalued. It's telling that this article frames housing as an investment vehicle rather than as a basic necessity. And it's not just a necessity because it shelters you from the elements and gives you storage for your stuff; it anchors you in a neighborhood and allows you to begin forming a local community. The flexibility of renting that this article glorifies is itself anathema to knowing and befriending your neighbors on anything but the shortest of terms; even if you don't intend to move, you have no guarantee that they won't up and exercise that flexibility. This is a major contributor to the modern loneliness epidemic.replywavemode 1 hour ago

I don't know
many homeowners who formed "local communities" with their neighbors. I know a few, but not many. And I know renters who know all their neighbors well. Seems more like a personality trait than something enabled by owning where you live.replyAeolun 3 minutes ago

I don’t know. The effect of many families with young children all going and buying a house at roughly the same time is absolutely a thing. My street was filled with children when I was young (newly built neighborhood), and the same thing is true again now that I’ve bought a house. The street is filled with parents and children at roughly the same place in life. It’s nice when the only thing you need to do to find playmates is make noise in the street.replymnky9800n 2 minutes ago

My building has a building association and we have meetings and also group events. When we were robbed our neighbours were there to help us. I definitely feel part of my community in my building. I think partly it is Dutch culture. I didn’t feel welcome at all by my neighbours in Norway in any of the neighbourhoods I lived in. I don’t think it’s just a personality thing.replybdangubic 1 hour ago

0% this - neighborhoods with single family homes are more likely to have families, and kids often create friendships that carry over to parent friendships. And if anybody in the neighborhood takes the initiative to plan block parties, dinner parties, etc., that really helps a community take root.This just doesn't happen as often with apartments, where people are more transient and more likely to be single and/or childless.replymoduspol 55 minutes ago

This was also our experience while owning three homes in single-family neighborhoods over a 35-year period. We knew our neighbors enough to say "hello", but that was it, and we never associated with them.
However, 13 years ago we bought an apartment in a large high-rise condominium building. To our surprise - because that was not a consideration when we moved - we have made many good friends among our neighbors. We go out to dinner together, we invite each other to our homes and to family celebrations. The downside is an aspect of communal living.
For example, we needed a new carpet in the building's lobby, so all the owners voted on the color. The majority chose green and we hate green, but we have to live with it.replycom2kid 2 minutes ago

As a renter who has recently been given notice that I must vacate my apartment in 90 days, you'd think I'd agree with you.However, I think this depends highly on the personality of the renter/owner, and that is the point this article misses.If someone is, like myself, comfortable with risks, I'm ok with changing neighbors, locations, and I've lived on 3 different continents and 9 cities?If you're someone who craves stability, then this isn't for you, and you're proably better off buying a house.replydavewritescode 19 minutes ago

I don’t think renting or buying makes a difference in communities.
I had a much better relationship with my neighbors when I rented vs now where I own my own home.I chalk up the difference to the fact that a lot of people my age couldn’t afford to live where I moved so my neighborhood is full of wealthier older people who I have nothing in common with.replyAfterHIA 1 hour ago

> the stability of buyingIt depends.Personally, after witnessing both sides of the coin second-hand, I am not leaning in the direction of either buying or renting in absolute. It is highly dependent on the context and circumstances of a specific situation/market.I am aware that this is just an anecdote (i.e., it isn't going to say much about the overall state of things across all states in the US), but there is a specific example I'd witnessed myself, which led me to believe that this is a bit more complicated than just "renting is the move" and "buying is the move."TLDR: one of my former coworkers bought a condo in Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle (which is a highly desirable and expensive neighborhood in that metro area). Within the first year of his ownership, the pipes behind his laundry machine burst due to no fault of his own (while he was at work), and it ended up flooding the apartment of the neighbor below. It decimated the flooring of both his own unit and the unit of the neighbor below. He ended up was facing the costs of unfucking his own condo AND the unit below.I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head at all (as the whole thing happened around 2018-2019, and I wasn't really involved in any direct way at all), but I remember that he did the math and (based upon the numbers, reasonably) ended up selling his condo as soon as he'd finished fixing his own unit + paying for the fixes to the unit below.Meanwhile, I am currently renting, and if the pipes in my unit burst and end up flooding the neighbors below, it would be mostly the problem of the property management company running my building to deal with, not mine. This alone make me feel way more stable than if I'd owned the unit I live in atm.replymauvehaus 5 minutes ago

If you're renting, getting the landlord to deal with an acute issue is pretty clear cut. They usually get it done. It's the slow burn neglect shit that's almost impossible to get fixed.Anecdote of my own: The last place we rented before buying had a minor roof leak. Minor, but still a roof leak. The landlord was old, her daughter was responsible for a lot of stuff, and they were both remote for at least part of the year. It took 3 years for them to finally get the roof replaced, evidently about a year after we left.And these were good landlords. They took care of a bunch of minor disasters in good time: dishwasher, washing machine, thermostats for the baseboard electric heat, stack vent got clobbered by ice coming off the roof? All dealt with promptly. But the roof, important though it was, wasn't a big enough problem to merit quick attention. The place was a log home, and by appearances, hadn't been subjected to any kind of refinishing for a good while too.replytehwebguy 1 hour ago

As an approximation, condo fees make explicit a number of recurring costs that are only implicit when you own. E.g. heating/cooling, maintenance, landscaping, accumulating an emergency fund, etc. Thus, if a condo is half-renting, so is buying a house.reply__turbobrew__ 1 hour ago

Almost everyone I know has a significant portion of their wealth in home equity. The renters I know tend to have much lower wealth. This is reflected broadly in the US wealth distribution.You brought up a good point though, and that’s the trap of being house poor. Too many owners fail to look / have not been taught to factor local property taxes and maintenance costs into their homes. My network definitely has people caught unaware by escrow shortages, siding costs, roof costs, HVAC stack costs.Despite it all, US homeowners seem to edge out renters, but it doesn’t have to be causative, either.https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AS...replybluefirebrand 30 minutes ago

I've seen these critiques for years.and while its not necessarily wrong, I believe it under weights a few points:- Fixing your housing costs against inflation: You can't count on housing price increases, but you can count on inflation. If you buy a house and your mortgage payment is > rent. Overtime it will naturally flip. $1 no longer buys me a chocolate bar, and $800/month no longer gets me a 2 bed apartment.- Leverage: I can't get a $700k loan to put into equities but I can for a home.- Capital Battery: As I build equity in my home it can become an asset I take loans against to pursue other opportunities.- Flexibility: Should I need to fiscally downsize I can still move out and rent out. Or rent a portion either via a suite or secondary unit- Stability: No one can evict me into a hot rental market to suit their needs.I wish more people talked about these points, selfishly so I didnt take so many of these articles at face value because in hindsight I wouldve bought earlier.replygruez 1 hour ago

Going 3x on S&P500 might be justified when you're a new grad, but not beyond your 30s.>- Flexibility: Should I need to fiscally downsize I can still move out and rent out.

> No one can evict me into a hot rental market to suit their needs.The bank can, if you take out too many loans against your house that you can’t pay back. When you barrow against your house you’re increasing your risk.“Rational people don’t risk what they have and need for what they don’t have and don’t need.” - Warren BuffettMy house is paid off now and I can’t think of anything that would make me barrow against it. Setting aside variable maintenance costs, with only having to worry about property taxes now, I could work at Costco and make ends meet now. That gives me some peace of mind against an uncertain job market. A loan against the house would change that equation wildly.reply9x39 36 minutes ago

It’s true over leveraging seems to be the American way, but GP was saying, I think, that homeownership does not have the risk of a landlord ending an otherwise mutually accepted relationship.If this is still accurate, a third of renters could theoretically be told the rent is doubling or learning the lease is ending. Depending on the health of the market, that can be a major risk, and not everyone can or wants the flexibility of a rental at all times.https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2022/housing-leases-in-the-u-s...replydbish 1 hour ago

You're not taking into account that housing prices can fall, not just stay flat and there are always things to fix and deal with in a house that you own.Renting it out is also not always gauranteed or easy if you are not nearby or don't want to deal with being a landlord, so imho that flexibility is not really there in many cases.replypton_xd 29 minutes ago

Counterpoint: buying is always better, people just can't afford it.Here where I live the minimum price for rent is monthly mortgage installement, meaning that you'll pay for rent at least as much as you'd pay for mortgage.But after you pay your mortgage you still have an asset in your hand. You can pass it on to your children or you can sell it when you're old, downsize (or even rent) and get some cash for your retirement.
If you rent you're left with nothing.Then why is not everyone buying? Because few people can afford the 20% downpayement needed for mortgage. In reality it's even more because you have to furnish and/or renovate the place.Renting has it's charm for youngsters, but once you get older and you start acummulating things the lack of stability and the danger of your landlord having a change of heart and breaking the contract (either because he decided to sell it or give it to a child) becomes a pain in the ass. Even having a pet is troublesome and many property owners will refuse to rent if you have a dog or a cat.replywavemode 1 hour ago

It's not just being able to afford it. It's also how easy can you sell it.

Interesting. Down here in Australia our economy has been doing OK, we've had a great run of dodging recessions, but due to house prices appreciating so much since the 90s, there's similar problems with house down payments being far out of reach of many people.Recently, our government is making a change to allow first homebuyers to purchase properties with only a 5% deposit.Historically the Australian government set up the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation in '67, to provide insurance for banks against the risk of borrowers defaulting, to support home buyers.
In 1997 the Howard government privatised the HLIC by selling it to GE, and we've had a private sector for mortgage insurance since, compulsory if borrowers are borrowing more than 80%.Now in 2025 the current Albanese government is rolling out a scheme where the government will act as a public mortgage insurer again to allow first home buyers to buy with only a 5% deposit.I'm not quite sure what to think. I heard an economist interviewed who reckoned this was a great idea to make it easier for young people to get into the property market, arguing that Aussie homeowners historically hardly ever default on mortgages.
But naively it seems like this is yet another change that is going to push up house prices even further by increasing demand, without doing something to increase supply.I also wonder if systemic mortgage default risk appears like it is lower than it actually is because Australia has been lucky enough to escape a major recession for so long.replycramsession 1 hour ago

It's interesting to paint the homeowner as an emotional person and the renter as the pragmatic, however both are roughly equally emotional.As the rent prices keep rising, the renter in the end will end up spending much more money in the same duration as a mortgage, won't they? After a few years, when they end up owning more of the property, they can secure a good deal with better monthly mortgage payments.They can also quite easily set up an AirBnB or get proper renters, if they want to have some flexibility, and in most cases the rent money will be more than the mortgage payments, so if they want to rent another place of their liking, the additional income will offset the monthly costs.replysidrag22 2 hours ago

its a unique math problem for the individual, but if you ARE buying, that likely means you have a down payment. so if you rent instead, you can then utilize that down payment for other investment opportunities.this touches on something the author sorta hinted at, mortgage as a forced investment. Some buyers/renters won't view the down payment as an investment opportunity if they go the path of renting, they decide to rent and suddenly theyve got a new car loan and all new furniture or whatever, and that down payment is gone, instead of compounding year over year in an attempt to make renting a financial advantageyou can usually napkin math investing the down payment and it makes more financial sense to rent, but from a human perspective its just not gonna happen like that for so many people. they are gonna mess with that money instead.replynovaRom 1 hour ago

How about the act of buying itself? Here where I live, you need to pay 12% on top of the home price simply for taxes and notary service. IMO it's one of the biggest obstacles and why most Swiss people prefer to rent.replyjfim 49 minutes ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Switzerland is a bit different from the US. From what I understand, property ownership entails paying the imputed rental value in taxes, which makes property ownership much less desirable. In the US, mortgage interest is tax deductible up to a certain limit, property taxes are deductible, and there's an amount of capital gains that's excluded from taxation when selling one's primary residence. Compared to other places in the world, the benefits of property ownership are pretty bonkers.replyjcims 1 hour ago

The home buying process seems to have been thoroughly corrupted, at least in the US.
The transaction costs are high, parasitic HOAs and paying over ask have been normalized, new homes are built as cheaply as possible, investors are driving up costs, etc. etc.
The investment aspect is a bit overrated.
You can't get that money 'back' because you still need a place to live.
Most folks just flip their equity into the next place, so it never really comes back to them until they downsize or die.I've been a homeowner for 30 years and am now renting a temporary apartment in a new location.
There's a lot of upside of renting.
I don't like apartment living at all, but I don't feel anchored to the location at all and have the freedom to live wherever without a bunch of overhead.
I'm definitely spending more money per square foot renting, and obviously none of this is coming back to myself or my family, but that's ok for me right now.I think my main takeaway is that there is no rule about what is best.
It's what's right for you at that time of your life.

First of all, I fundamentally disagree on the notion that buying a home should be considered an investment (I would go as far as to argue that this attitude is part of the reason the real estate markets are so broken in many places of the world). I don't want to be rich and I don't need to be - I just want a place where my kids some day can grow up, where I can enjoy the sun in the garden and invite family and friends over to spend a nice evening. I do not care about the financial aspect of it beyond "can I afford this without overstretching and putting my family into financial danger".From a purely financial perspective, I think you could say: the more protections you as a renter receive, the more renting makes sense.Living in Germany, I do have quite a few protections as a renter. My landlord can't arbitrarily hike prices, etc. In my current city, it would be absolutely impossible to get a mortgage anywhere close to my current monthly rent (even with substantial equity)replymalshe 26 minutes ago

When I bought me house what I eventually decided is you can't use ordinary financial metrics for owner occupied housing. The reason is buying a house on credit is essentially the only investment you can make with the money you have available for housing.My opinion is the issue with renting and housing in general is the world wide financialization of real estate. It's being treated as a primary investment instead of the secondary investment it is. Some fraction of people are getting exceedingly wealthy but there are deep negative effects.My bet is the crashing fertility rates are likely what's going to put a stop to it.

This is one persons opinions on their own situation. It’s written too broadly, but does a reasonable job representing one side of the tradeoffs that people should consider. It is not particularly balanced or overly insightful for anyone who has spent much time thinking this stuff through, and a lot of statements that could be backed by data are not and are simply asserted as fact. (For example, the idea that renters are more likely to pursue promotions is a very non-serious argument unless backed with some actual data)If this had been framed differently, it would be more interesting. Instead it comes across as universal (“most people won’t saved unless forced to”) and ignores the many many benefits of buying. (Not mentioning 5x leverage on a historically good asset is willful ignorance)As a former renter of 20 years, these are great points that everyone should evaluate. As someone for whom home ownership made sense now, I wish I had been able to prioritize those factors earlier as it would have been nice to have my mortgage locked in at 2010 prices.replyal_borland 2 hours ago

The prevalence of luxury apartments flies in the face of the overbuying section. People overbuy on apartments as well.Every time I see someone arguing about minimum wage, their benchmark seems to be having a 2 bedroom apartment, not a studio or even a 1 bedroom. I find this wildly unrealistic.Apartments also sell people on amenities that almost no one uses, but justify higher rent prices.These luxury apartments are used in the same way people use their over-bought homes. It’s a way to buy into a different class of neighbors, feel like you’re not sacrificing with a rental, signal to others that you’re doing well, ideally have better management/maintenance, and live in a place that out-classes the home they may otherwise buy… all with no maintenance or investment.I’ve seen some crazy rent prices.

I don’t really like being a home owner, but the rent prices these days are so out of hand. I think the most I ever paid for rent was $1,680 and I felt irresponsible doing that.

The $6k number is a touch high, but the answer is realistically 30-something DINKs and up. I make $150k a year, let’s say, and if I have a spouse with a corporate career let’s say it’s similar so maybe $250k-300k per year in income? Well that’s about $12,000 in income after taxes, medical, and a 10% retirement contribution.So, yes, $6k per month is house-poor numbers, but it’s workable for sure.

Making that much, I wouldn’t want to put anymore than 25% of my take-home toward rent.

I wouldn't want to purely out of the waste, but from a risk perspective, why not? Your other costs don't scale with housing or income, so if you're spending $70k on housing, you might be at $100k overall expenses. Add another $50k for income taxes and $50k for retirement savings and you're still at 50-100k left over for whatever you like (using 250-300 household income).6k for a mortgage would be scary in case of job loss, but for rent, whatever, just move.replyal_borland 48 minutes ago

The lease terms would be important. Not all leases let you out whenever you want.Plus, if a sizable portion of that household income is in the form of stock or a bonus, that isn’t showing up each month in the paycheck, lowering the monthly cash flow. If there is a layoff early in the year before the bonus pays out, and you can’t exit the lease, that would be a bad spot to be in.There is still risk on the table, depending on how some of this is structured.replyndriscoll 25 minutes ago

The fact that the author writes about his buying decision in first person singular is telling. Home "as a product" (vs investment) is contingent on your situation in life.If you are a single person who is likely to get married and/or move for work, why would you buy? The transaction costs of buying and then selling are non trivial.On the other hand if you are with your wife and kids, the potential ability to move for a job is less important (objectively) than community you are establishing for your kids and family. So it's not just those who value stability vs flexibility as a behavioral trait but as a realistic reflection of a situation.It's like a bike guy becomes a minivan guy when he has 3 kids.replyarnonejoe 2 hours ago

I have owned a few homes over the years and have also had many landlords. The house we rented in Lafayette, Ca in 2010 was in a nice hood.
At the time it was 2 years past the financial crisis and homeownership was not something I wanted to do for a while.
The land lady we rented from wanted to sell the house for 650k. That house is now 4.3 million on zillow.
Granted it has since had a renovation and an addition, but still.
We also rented a townhouse in Encinitas, Ca.
The rent was 3k a month in 2017 and now a similar townhouse in the same complex is renting out for 6500.
The problem with renting is that eventually you get priced out of the nicer hoods. The problem with not buying a house when a deal shows up in a decent hood is that eventually that hood will never be affordable to mere mortals again.

My current assumption is that other classes of assets, assuming technological progress continues at its current rate, will grow significantly faster than demand for land.
So the economics that once made homeownership favorable, no longer exist.Holding the assumption that your landlord operates on favorable conditions (mine is pretty responsive and rent increases are controlled), I’m not sure I have a good reason to opt to purchase a house unless I’m planning on occupying it for the next 2 decades at minimum.I can’t help but think purchasing is an emotional decision, unless the location you live in allows you to buy for a similar rate to the mortgage pricing, but I’ve only observed this in LCOL areas.replyavianlyric 51 minutes ago

Or you can try a third-party service like Questrade, WealthSimple etc. It's even possible to hold options in a TFSA if you have the right paperwork, as long as you don't give the CRA the impression that you're making a "business" out of "day trading". Once you're set up it should be easy to find "some small/medium cap ETFs", for both Canadian and American (and maybe international) holdings.tl;dr: talk to someone at your bank.

So, I've pretty much settled on buying something small in another city and renting it out while we rent here.I think this might be a good balance to get us some type of flexibility while also diversifying our assets. But now the problem is trying to find a decent rental property in another city :preplyrda2 2 hours ago

Pretty lacking in math for an article that mentions math a few times.I looked into this a few years ago when I was trying to see if we were really in the worst housing market ever, and came to the opposite conclusion.

There used to be a world where you could get INTO the investment with almost free money. You can't get a 2% loan and dump it into the stock market. Well you can't do either anymore but you used to be able to :)replydcre 2 hours ago

Being 47 and still renting I think the piece missed a big issue, which is most prevalent these days: we cannot afford to buy. Anything. Anywhere.

I travel around the US and Canada in my campervan and I've noticed that it feels like a lot more people live in RV's now, which enables you to buy something and park it nearly anywhere (location wise) that you can find space. There are RV parks all over. Depending on where you decide to be, it probably isn't a bad solution and worth considering if you do want to own something, but don't want or can't commit to a whole house.replyfreshtake 1 hour ago

The TL;DR is that the value of renting vs. buying has a lot to do with being realistic and understanding real estate and investments in general.Buying a house is often an emotionally motivated decision with many important risk factors... Were inspections comprehensive and thorough or did they overlook an issue with the foundation, wiring, plumbing, etc.? Did the buyer understand the required disclosures, and specifically understand what the seller is not obligated to disclose in their jurisdiction? (e.g., in many areas the seller is not obligated to disclose if a child sex offender lives next door). Is the neighborhood up and coming or struggling?Getting these wrong can easily negate the potential upsides of ownership.Renting can also be great, but as the article points out, if it mostly just results in more disposable cash, then you may be better off owning (forced savings). Rental properties often cannot be sublet and also cannot be used as collateral or passed on to family members with a step-up in basis. Rental leases also fluctuate with the market, so it's not uncommon in big cities for renters to be paying close or equal prices of their homeowners next door.Anecdotally I know many folks who have rented their way through, invested wisely, and done well. I also know folks who have moved around the US and always purchased, did their homework, capitalized on tax incentives, and now have a stable of rental properties that helped them become FIRE.replyForHackernews 1 hour ago

Reminds me of https://jlcollinsnh.com/2023/03/02/why-your-house-is-a-terri...“Hey I’ve got an idea. We’re always talking about good investments. What if we came up with the worst possible investment we can construct? What might that look like?”Well, let’s see now (pulling out our lined yellow pad), let’s make a list. To be really terrible:- It should be not just an initial, but if we do it right, a relentlessly ongoing drain on the cash reserves of the owner.- It should be illiquid. We’ll make it something that takes weeks, no – wait – even better, months of time and effort to buy or sell.- It should be expensive to buy and sell. We’ll add very high transaction costs. Let’s say 5% commissions on the deal, coming and going.- It should be complex to buy or sell. That way we can ladle on lots of extra fees and reports and documents we can charge for.- It should generate low returns. Certainly no more than the inflation rate. Maybe a bit less.- It should be leveraged! Oh, oh this one is great! This is how we’ll get people to swallow those low returns! If the price goes up a little bit, leverage will magnify this and people will convince themselves it’s actually a good investment! Nah, don’t worry about it. Most will never even consider that leverage is also very high risk and could just as easily wipe them out."replyJustsignedup 1 hour ago

Counter thought:Rent is going up A LOT every year. My parent's house in a similar area is not, even with extra taxes, it is far lower than what I pay.They fix up something, its fixed. We have a problem -- it will be fixed in the cheapest possible terribly looking way.And rent keeps going up. All the time. By so much.There's flexibility in it when you're in your 20s. But in 30s and 40s its terrible.replyzamalek 2 hours ago

There is one unmentioned far future benefit: if you pay your mortgage off before retirement you'll probably enjoy more shelter security than your peers. Rent is a monthly cost (eating into your retirement) that could skyrocket (which your retirement plans may not have accounted for).Of course, a solid investment plan may offset these - but only a domicile (doesn't need to be a house) would survive everything related to the economy going to utter hell.I agree about houses, though. A saner plan may be to purchase a modest apartment or the like, that you keep in the wings until you reach retirement.replygedy 2 hours ago

I don't disagree with the his points, however:"The flexibility of renting has major financial advantages"Like 80% of my motivation to make money in past was: to buy a house.
I have no interest in FIRE and be a couch surfing digital nomad around the world or whatever.So it's hard for me to be motivated by the financial aspect if the end result was no house for now basically.replyajross 1 hour ago

> Buying a Home Isn’t Really an InvestmentThat's... really not correct.
And the section that follows the heading doesn't talk about (or even try to define) "investments" at all.A home mortgage is a heavily (!) subsidized, very safe, easily-acquired and extremely leveraged investment in an asset class that tends over long terms to grow as well as anything else.A young professional looking at a putting $100k into stocks or as downpayment on a $500k (!) mortgage is just a no brainer.
Fast forward 20 years and the 5x is applied to all the appreciation.Buy homes, folks.
Worry about renting only when you're old and are making the decision as to whether to by your fifth home for cash or to finance and put the money into another asset class.
The only time you decide not to is when you know a priori you can't hold the property long enough to cover the purchase overhead.(That said: there are lots of macroeconomic and environmental reasons to think a culture where everyone should buy a home is a bad thing.
But in our culture, everyone should buy a home.)replymandeepj 1 hour ago

My mortgage is $1900 a month and I am extremely grateful for that, because it's been that for three years.

I like the general idea of this post but in the end I think it suffers from being too generalized and a little bit too renting biased.> The math can always be made to “work” if you’re willing to adjust what or where you buy.This is essentially a useless statement, the result of the math is either that either renting or buying makes you end up more wealthy. Whether it "works" or not isn't even the question, the question is which choice makes you more wealthy over time (more on that later).For that, it's more helpful to use a rent vs. buy calculator [1] with the details of your market plugged in. Whether renting or buying makes more sense for you has a lot to do with where you live.Let's continue on to the next section, "Buying a Home Isn’t Really an Investment."The obvious rebuttal to this is "of course it is!"> The decision is usually driven by lifestyle factors such as proximity to work, school districts, family, and the neighborhood.All of these factors play in to whether or not the property is a good investment. Places that are in good school districts and have close proximity to job centers are good investments. The real estate investors that this section mentions think about these exact same things before starting projects.Next section: "People Tend to Overbuy." Is there any data or evidence behind this whole paragraph? Are we just saying that people who own homes buy more furniture and stuff than renters? Maybe they do, but even if that's true could that be because they're more wealthy in the first place? Who knows, this entire paragraph is all assumptions and nothing backing it up.Next section: "The Flexibility of Renting Is Undervalued"6/10 Americans live within 10 miles of where they grew up, and 8/10 Americans live within 100 miles of where they grew up. [2] Is the flexibility of renting actually needed for most Americans? Are Americans missing out on job promotions because they own homes? (It's not like you can't sell a home quickly)I would counter the premise of this section with "The stability of home ownership is undervalued" and "the 30-year fixed mortgage is a gigantic subsidy to homebuyers." By taking out a mortgage, homeowners are locking in the majority of their monthly cost with the exception of maintenance, utilities, and property taxes. They sit in their house for a few years and they end up paying below market on monthly payment compared to renters. So maybe they "overbought" a home with too many bedrooms to fit all phases of life, but it doesn't really matter because after the first ~5-10 years of home ownership they are going to be paying less than market-rate rentals.The 30-year fixed mortgage allows homeowners to refinance and minimize their rate pretty much any time the rate drops, so basically every renter is always getting the lowest rate possible since from their purchase date forward, and it never goes up.The last section: Why the Home Investment Myth PersistsSure, this section is technically correct, someone investing money elsewhere is going to beat real estate on returns. But you can't live in an index fund, an index fund may not have the same protections [a] and tax incentives as a home, and it is a fact that most people are not disciplined with investments which means the forced investment of a mortgage's end result is that homeowners are far more wealthier than renters on average. [3][a] For example, your home equity doesn't count toward the ability to pay calculation for FAFSA, and you are generally protected from having your home taken away from you if you get into most debt situations.
