I've long used fixed-released operating systems that require major upgrades to bring the underlying code up to scratch with the latest updates that aren't minor. In recent times, I've gradually moved to rolling-release Linux distros and much prefer being able to update just about every part of the OS without having to wait for the developers to roll out a major upgrade. But which do you prefer?
