After the Nintendo Direct presentation last Friday, I quickly bought the DK Island & Emerald Rush DLC for Donkey Kong Bananza, mostly because I love the base game and figured I'd have fun with it. The DLC contains a rogue-like mode where you have to collect as much emerald ore as possible in a limited time.I find the concept intriguing, and it's decently to fun to play in the moment, but I've found it hard to stay invested in the game as it feels like there's no real progress being made. It could also be that I'm bad at the game, but I've felt similarly about games like Dead Cells, which has me thinking I might just not like this genre. Do you like roguelike games, or do you prefer games that have a more defined path to progression?
