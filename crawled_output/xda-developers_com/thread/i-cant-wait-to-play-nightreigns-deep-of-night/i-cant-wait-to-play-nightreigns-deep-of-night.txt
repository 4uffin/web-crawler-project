Now that it has been a few months since Elden Ring: Nightreign dropped, we've had quite a few bosses added to the game (even though they're technically just the enhanced versions of their base-game counterparts). If you're even remotely as into Nightreign as I am, you've probably beaten everything the game has to offer and are itching for something new to fight. Well, Fromsoftware will add a hard mode starting next week, and I can't wait to try it out. Named Deep of Night, this mode will apparently add random bosses, buffed enemies, and a progression system, wherein the game gets progressively harder the deeper you go into the mode. Me? I just want to equip more relics and create the most broken builds possible. Leaks revealed Deep of Night allows up to six relics for each Nightfarer, and I'll probably spend the first couple of days farming the relics exclusive to this mode.
