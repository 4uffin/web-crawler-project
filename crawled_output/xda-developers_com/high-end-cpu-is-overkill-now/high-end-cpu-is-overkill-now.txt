Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
When I say "high-end CPUs", I mean any CPU with more than 8 cores. These processors are undoubtedly made for particularly demanding workloads, and have their place on the market. That said, the relevance of high-end chips has gone down with time, especially for those only interested in gaming, occasional productivity, or even AI/ML workloads. Due to the advances in computational power, challenges with scaling, and more emphasis on the GPU, high-end CPUs just aren't as necessary anymore.
Modern entry-level chips are enough for most people
Counting cores is passé
Only a few years ago, entry-level CPUs had just 4 cores, and they were legitimate contenders for budget PCs. In contrast, quad-core CPUs have been firmly replaced by 6-core chips, raising the standard of budget performance. Modern processors have advanced to the point where an entry-level, 6-core CPU is all that most users need, whether they're gaming, streaming, or dabbling in video editing. Unless your professional or enthusiast needs demand the horsepower of a 12-core or 16-core CPU, you can easily make your PC last for five years (or more) with a 6-core or 8-core chip. More than the number of cores on a CPU, it's the underlying architecture that matters to the end user. And with Zen 5 and Arrow Lake CPUs on the market, the microarchitectures have evolved enough that people don't need to count cores anymore.
More cores don't always mean more performance
Performance scaling is complex
While higher-end CPUs promise more grunt, the performance doesn't always scale like you'd expect. For starters, gaming performance depends more on single-core frequency and on-die cache than on the number of cores. More cores will offer some additional frames, even at higher resolutions, but the difference pales in comparison to what you can get with, say, a Ryzen X3D CPU — a "measly" 8-core chip. Even in 2025, the difference in gaming performance between a 6-core and 8-core CPU isn't worth paying the premium for the latter. In fact, the FPS gap between the two types of chips is closing with every generation. More cores certainly benefit productivity workloads, but if you can stomach a few more seconds or minutes when rendering your videos, you'll be fine with an 8-core CPU.
Cooling high-end CPUs is no joke
How hot is too hot?
Performance-per-watt is gaining more importance with every new generation of CPUs. While AMD chips are becoming more power-efficient, Intel has a long way to go in terms of lowering power consumption. You can't escape the fact that taming high-end CPUs like the Core i9-14900K, Core Ultra 9 285K, or Ryzen 9 7950X can be hard on even high-end liquid coolers. This makes it challenging for performance-chasers who also value a cool and silent machine. They often need to strike a balance between core count and operating temps, and most users can easily do that with 8-core CPUs. If you don't really need the performance of a power-hungry CPU, living with elevated temps becomes a question mark. Many users already undervolt their CPUs — chasing lower temperatures isn't a fad, it's a necessity.
Overclocking has lost its relevance
Affecting the appeal of high-end chips
Much of the appeal of the most powerful CPUs used to be their overclocking headroom. Enthusiasts and tinkerers used to chase frequency records in a bid to squeeze out every last bit of performance from their high-end processors. With time, however, the relevance of overclocking has all but disappeared. Modern CPUs are essentially factory-overclocked, running close to their potential out of the box. This makes the time and effort spent on overclocking a lot less appealing than it used to be. Besides, the mainstream nature of PC hardware has slowly but surely impacted user habits — people just want their components to offer maximum performance without a lot of tweaking. Most users are content with 6-core and 8-core CPUs, enjoying ample performance and the best of modern microarchitectures without the need to waste hours overclocking their CPUs.
The GPU is the priority in most builds
Doing most of the heavy lifting
Finally, high-end CPUs owe their falling necessity to GPUs assuming a much bigger role than ever. Whether you're gaming, working on visually demanding applications, or running AI workloads, the GPU does the heavy lifting nowadays. You can manage without a powerful CPU, but it's hard to extract respectable performance without a powerful graphics card. Most of the parallel processing that was handled by the CPU in the past has been taken over by the GPU. Even when you're playing CPU-dependent games or running CPU-heavy applications, it often comes down to single-core performance rather than the number of cores. The graphics card continues to demand the biggest chunk of the budget when building a PC, and high-end CPUs are becoming more and more limited to professional use cases.
Do you really need to buy a high-end CPU?
If you're building a new PC in 2025, you should think thrice before splurging on a high-end CPU. Unless you know you need all that extra performance, the ROI just isn't there. It's much better to allocate most of your budget to the graphics card, which will net you the most performance gains. Whether you're building a PC for gaming, productivity, or AI computing, it might be more practical to avoid CPUs with over 8 cores.

I agree with some of it. If you are just browsing and doing regular sites, email, etc....then no, you don't need a high end CPU. If you want to edit videos, then a higher end cpu with more cores will get the job done faster. Again, it all depends on what you're trying to do. I'd stay away from Intel until they get their newer CPUs out towards the end of next year, going into 2027. AMD is really still at the top and you don't have to change motherboards nearly as often. I just got a 9950x price matched for $530. Did I need that much? Probably not. But I know it'll go many years until I need to upgrade. I do some video editing but again, I probably went overboard. I just know it'll be many years going strong. I've watched several videos and I was going to get a Threadripper and that they said is definitely unneeded and going overboard. So, I stuck with the Ryzen.

CPUs are fast enough now.... I don't upgrade often (9 years on FX6300 and 2 years now on AMD 3600)... I remember when I had 16 MHZ, overclocked to 20 MHz and had 300 MHz CPU, bumped it up to 450 MHz.... That was exciting time for me.... Now, it's already running 4 GHz easily without much work.... That will last like 5-10 years.... it's fast enough to turn on and up under 15 sec...

I'm curious what you use your pc for.Side note, boot up times are not equivalent to a fast cpu. It has more to do with storage and can be effected by system memory and training, then after that, what programs you have on during start up.My 7950x3D takes over a minute to fully boot, because of all i have it doing.

Obviously you have not read the requirements for borderland 4. It requires an 8 core cpu. I have 6 core CPU in my laptop anlong with a 3070 and cannot get past the loading screen.

There's no such thing as ROI on a gaming PC. It's a hobby.On the other hand, my Threadripper Pro 7000 soon to be replaced by Threadripper Pro 9000 pays for itself over and over again within 3 to five days in production. It hasn't seen a game ever, though.

My cluster is up to 100 cores, and 314gb ram. Its just never enough for me. But its not new stuff, but what i can reasonably afford. Gotta be rich for that new stuff, i doubt if i sold all my equipment i could even afford a 5090, and theres 6 dgpus in the bunch.

"Modern CPUs are essentially factory-overclocked, running close to their potential out of the box.".... if not higher than their potential *cough* *13th and 14th gen Intel stability problems* *cough*.
And XMP profiles where the RAM just may or may not work in your setup.It's true though, single-core performance and having 'some' cores will probably get you better gaming performance than some system with larger numbers of cores but each core is slower (of course a few of the AMD CPUs do manage to do both, plenty of cores and each is very fast)..
Many games have 1 to 2 CPU-intensive loops, and the rest are little threads that may only add up to 1-2% CPU use individually, so you may only get use of 3 or 4 cores (or 5 or 6 at the outset).
Well other than compiling shaders, which can use as many cores as you have, but that happens on install or video driver update, not just whenever.I must agree on cooling as well, I've always preferred (even if I did have the budget for it, which of course budget is a consideration) to avoid the 'top of the top' because I don't want like a 100+W CPU in my system, I'd rather have the one that gets like 80% the performance at less than half the power consumption.
Stable, cool, and quiet.

I don't agree with a lot of it. Especially for gaming. Your CPU truly does matter in gaming. There is still a lot in gaming a CPU handles. Call of Duty for example is a high intensive CPU game. You also need to make sure your CPU isn't bottlenecking your GPU. Especially when you buying a expensive GPU. Why leave performance on the table with a cheap CPU.
