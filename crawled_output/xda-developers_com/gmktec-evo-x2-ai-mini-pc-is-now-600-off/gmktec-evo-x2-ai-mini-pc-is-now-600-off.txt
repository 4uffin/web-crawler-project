This is one of those mini PCs that's built with a purpose. It isn't cheap, but it's extremely powerful, packing some of the best hardware you'll find in a compact size. Not only are you getting AMD's Ryzen Al Max+ 395 chip, but it's also paired with 96GB of LPDDR5X 8000MHz RAM. If that wasn't enough, it also comes with 1TB of SSD storage that's also upgradeable, along with a steep $600 discount that drops it down to its lowest price yet. Again, this mini PC isn't for everyone, but if this is something that you've been looking for, we think it's a good time to buy.
A lot of power in a small box

Sure, you can use this PC for pretty much anything you can think of, but for the amount of RAM, and the way this unit is set up, we think it's geared towards hosting local LLMs. And if this is the first time you've heard about this, it's a thing, and allows you to enjoy powerful AI tools without having to send your data out to the internet.
With that said, if you want, you can also use this PC for everyday use as well, which means it's great for typing up papers, surfing the web, and also playing games. Of course, with this much power, and the integrated Radeon RX 8060S GPU, we also think that this PC would be perfect for creative tasks like photo and video editing.
Connectivity is also quite good with two Thunderbolt 4, five USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, SD card slot, Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. It also has plenty of cooling on the inside, ensuring sustained performance, even under the most demanding conditions. And if you want that added pop of color, this mini PC also has customizable RGB lighting as well.
Overall, not a bad system for something so compact. As stated before, this mini PC isn't going to be for everyone, and at this price you might even be able to build something better yourself. Of course, if you want a compact size with the same power, this mini PC can't be beat. So grab the $600 discount before you check out to save.
