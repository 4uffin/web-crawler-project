4 reasons a SATA SSD still belongs in your gaming rig

SATA SSDs aren't the flashiest solid state drives out there anymore. We've got M.2 flash storage that fits easily into PCIe slots on your motherboard, and that sleek SSD format is quickly taking over most of the SSD market. Most of the new SSDs you see these days are M.2 NVMe, and for good reason. NVMe storage is faster, has less latency, and has no need for messy cables. With all of that said, despite the blazing fast speed of NVMe, there are still reasons you may want to put those SATA ports in your mortherboard to use and opt for a SATA SSD.
4
SATA is still more cost-effective in bulk.
M.2 NVMe storage is getting cheaper, but not enough.
Games are absolutely massive these days, with many of the latest titles taking up at least 100GB of storage space. So even if you can get a solid 1TB NVMe SSD for $70-90, you can only store a handful of games before you need to either start uninstalling games, or get more storage. While the price of NVMe drives has dropped considerably in the last couple of years, NVMe storage is still pretty expensive when you get in the 2TB and higher range. While most people won't need more than 1TB of storage on their PC, gamers and content creators have a much greater need for additional storage space. You can get a decent 2TB NVMe SSD for about $150 or so, but the price of NVMe flash storage more than doubles above that threshold. So, if you want to have more than a small fraction of your Steam library saved on your gaming PC, you'll be looking at closer to 4TB of storage. At that capacity, a good SATA drive is about half the price of an NVMe SSD. It may be slower, but unless your games are using DirectStorage, it's possible that your loading times are going to be more influenced by your CPU and the speed it can decompress assets compared to the raw read speeds of an M.2 NVMe.
3
SATA has lower power draw
M.2 NVMe requires a bit more power, and that adds up.
NVMe drives have higher bandwidth than their SATA counterparts, which means NVMe storage needs a more complicated storage controller. The increased complexity in the storage controller of an M.2 NVMe drive will require more active power draw. This could eat over a watt of power, just for the SSD to sit idle. While a single watt of power isn't too large, it can add up as you add more drives, and SATA tends to utilize a tenth of that power while idling, which can cut down your PC's power usage overall. The increase in power draw is tiny, don't get me wrong, but it is something SATA does better. This won't make up for an Nvidia RTX 5090's truly insane power draw, but cutting out unnecessary power requirements can help keep your PC running efficiently, which will help you keep your power bill from running too high.

SATA runs much cooler
No need to invest in a costly heat-sink for a SATA drive.
Since SATA drives don't have the same level of power-draw as an M.2 drive, they also tend to run much cooler than NVMe storage. While an M.2 NVMe drive isn't going to cause your desktop to overheat single handedly, NVMe storage does run hotter than SATA, which means you may need to invest in a heat-sink for your SSD, or adjust your fan curves with your NVMe storage in mind, which generally isn't how you tend to set a fan curve. While a robust cooling system will help alleviate the extra thermal load of an M.2 drive, if you're upgrading an older build or trying to build a mini-ATX or ITX mini-PC, the extra heat may cause some issues with your cooling plan, leading to thermal throttling.

SATA is easier to replace
Need a new SSD? SATA drives are much easier to swap out.
Because NVMe flash storage slots into the PCIe lanes in your motherboard, it can be a bit more painful to replace or upgrade. Depending on your motherboard, you may need to screw your M.2 NVMe drive into the motherboard directly, or use proprietary clips to install it which can be a bit of a hassle to undo. Adding a heat-sink to your M.2 drive will cut down on the thermal cost of the faster storage, but it adds another layer of installation and upgrade complexity. Plus, in some cases, your fastest M.2 slot might not be accessible without removing the GPU from your system. On top of that, it requires more specialized hardware to use an M.2 NVMe drive as an external SSD once you're done using it inside your PC. A SATA drive can pretty easily become an external SSD or travel drive, with many cheap enclosures capable of housing it and connecting it to just about anything you can think of. But you will need a pricey enclosure to turn your NVMe SSD into a travel drive if you want to get some additional use out of it.
Hybrid solutions may be best
Going for a hybrid storage setup may be a bit old-school by today's PC building standards. However, a best of both worlds type of solution may be the best choice. If you'd still like the increased performance of an NVMe SSD, run an M.2 NVMe SSD on your motherboard for the essentials and store your games on a SATA D-drive. That way, you get the speed and performance boost of the M.2 drive when you need it, and the cheaper, more efficient storage for those giant game install folders.

I'm super sorry to it tell you this m.2 it just as fast if not faster to replace then a serial ATA drive. An m.2 requires a single screw to be removed while a serial ATA may require a number of screws or a special case that can flip into a drive holder. Also the price of a serial ATA is more expensive than m.2. if you have to uninstall a game then so be it the install time and the uninstall time is far quicker than having a few extra terabytes of space to hold games that you do not play. There are also adapters and things of that nature to allow you to take your m.2 and expand it to a much larger number of drives. Even PCI Express adapters can hold a large number of m.2 drives.

What if your gpu is obstructing your m.2 connection?.. You'd have to remove your gpu. I have three sata sdd's in my case...none of them are screwed in anywhere as I don't feel the need (no moving parts)
& I don't move my pc. They're just 'arranged' in the concealed psu section.
