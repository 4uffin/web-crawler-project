Love tech as much as we do? Join Team XDA!
XDA is the world’s largest online tech community. We cover everything that matters in mobile tech, from phones to laptops and more. We review all the latest gadgets and gear and create useful guides that help you do more with the tech you own.
Looking for the perfect Android phone? Curious how Apple’s latest watch really stacks up? XDA has you covered. And if there’s ever a major Android security vulnerability, you’ll learn about it first on XDA. It’s no wonder why 30 million people browse XDA every month, or why 11 million users have signed up for accounts on the world-famous XDA Forums.
XDA isn’t just a great resource for our readers. We’re also a welcoming and rewarding workplace. Simply put, if you live and breathe tech like we do, we want you to join our content team.
Here’s What People Are Saying About XDA
@TheRichWoods
Yeah, guess it's time for my own Some Personal News (TM). Starting next week, I'm going to be editor-in-chief at @xdadevelopers
@chris_wedel
Personal news time: Today is my last day at @androidcentral. The change is very much bittersweet as I've loved the people and opportunities in my time spent there. But change is inevitable, and I'll be heading to @xdadevelopers as the new Mobile Section Editor.️
@AdamConwayIE
While I've reached out to Samsung for further clarification on this statement, the company seems to have been aware of this since 2016, which is insanely worrying and matches up with the file having been first submitted to VirusTotal in 2016.
@AdamConwayIE
This year has been a pretty hectic one, and I'm really proud of some of the work I've done with @xdadevelopers. These are some of my favourite pieces that I've written in 2022! Getting to cover the @CSGO Antwerp major was an incredible experience.
@alexdobie
Here's part one in a two-part @xdadevelopers look back at old phone features, in which I reminisce about my favorite three old-ass phone features we just don't see anymore. Once upon a time there was more to life than glass, metal and hole-punches!
