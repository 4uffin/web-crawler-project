Building a PC is fun, but if you just want to buy something to get yourself up and running, then a pre-built PC is the way to go. Naturally, there are plenty of great options to go with, but if you've been looking for a powerful gaming PC that also looks pretty sleek, then this Alienware is a good place to start.
Not only does it feature Intel Core Ultra 9, but it also has an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card. While it has a retail price of $3,000, it can now be had for far less, with a stellar discount that drops it down by $600, falling to $2,400 for a limited time.
It's all covered with nothing to worry about

Sometimes it's hard to get a hold of some parts, which is just one of the reasons why going pre-built is a great option. In addition, you'll have a warranty on all parts and service, which means you go through one company if you have any problems. This particular model has on-site service, which means they'll come to you if the problem can't be fixed remotely. When it comes to this Alienware PC, you get a sleek and subdued desktop, with RGB lighting that makes the case and internals pop in just the right way. As mentioned before, it's powered by an Intel Core Ultra 9 that's paired with 32GB of DDR5 RAM. Furthermore, you also get 1TB of SSD storage, along with a beefy Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card.
It also has a 1000W Platinum power supply, which means you'll be able to upgrade parts inside the PC without worrying about overloading it. You can probably guess, but this PC easily handles anything you can throw at it. Whether that's playing AAA games or editing music or videos. This Alienware PC is an absolute winner, and you can now grab it with a substantial discount from Amazon.
