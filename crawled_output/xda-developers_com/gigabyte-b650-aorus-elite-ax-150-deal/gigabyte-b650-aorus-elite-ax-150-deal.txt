We liked this motherboard when we reviewed it, praising its sleek design, great features, and overclocking support. However, with this recent discount from Woot that drops it down to $150, it becomes an absolute no-brainer to pick up if you're looking to build a new Ryzen-powered AM5 PC.
Affordable and feature-packed
Gigabyte makes a pretty good board here, with an excellent layout that's also pleasing to the eyes. Of course, what matters most is that you're going to get all the IO you need with this board, with support for AMD's latest CPU platform, which means you'll be able to install any AM5 chips that meet your needs.
You also get support DDR5 with four RAM slots and there's three PCI x16 slots as well. Just in case you're not quite ready to grab a graphics card, this motherboard does have support for CPUs with integrated graphics, which means built-in HDMI and DisplayPorts. There are also three M.2 slots, ten USB-A ports, USB-C, Wi-Fi 6E, Ethernet, Bluetooth 5.2, and 3.5mm audio jacks.
There's room for overclocking and the thermals are also pretty good here. So if you're building something compact, you shouldn't have any issues with this motherboard. At its original price, we thought it was a pretty good option if you were looking to build something new with AMD's AM5 chips. It's a simple and budget-friendly motherboard that's packed with many ports and features.
