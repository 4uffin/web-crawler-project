There are a lot of great reasons to upgrade your router, especially if you're using something that comes from your internet service provider. A new router can provide better control, along with added features, while also providing better speeds too. It's a huge win if you're someone that relies on the internet every single day. Of course, there are plenty of different routers to choose from, but we think this one from Netgear delivers exactly what you're looking for in an upgrade at a price that's easy to accept.

Despite routers all having the same function, not all are equal. This is especially the case if you're using something from your ISP, because those devices are usually pretty barebones. The good news is that upgrading your router can lead to a number of improvements, with better speed and consistency in your internet connection.
This one from Netgear that's on sale right now utilizes Wi-Fi 6 technology, delivering speeds up to 1.8 Gbps, while also covering up to 1,500 square feet. You can have up to 20 devices connected at a time, and there are also four Ethernet ports, just in case you need wired connections to a few of your devices.
The router is pretty easy to set up, and can be done through an accompanying app from your phone or tablet. You can also control the router using the app, while also looking at traffic data as well. Overall, this router provides a solid experience that doesn't cost a whole lot. Grab it now for just $60 while you can.
