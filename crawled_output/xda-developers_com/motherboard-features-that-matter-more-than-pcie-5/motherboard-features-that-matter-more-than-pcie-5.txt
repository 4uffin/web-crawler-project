It's easy to get caught up in the hype around PCIe 5.0 when you're shopping for a new motherboard in 2025. After all, manufacturers often tout it as a must-have for future-proofing your build in their marketing materials. However, the reality is that even the fastest consumer GPU, the Nvidia RTX 5090, doesn't fully saturate PCIe 4.0 in gaming or rendering workloads. Benchmarks show only about a 1â€“2% performance drop for the GPU when moving from PCIe 5.0 to 4.0, which really isn't something to worry about for now. I'm not saying you all should buy PCIe 4.0 motherboards over PCIe 5.0 if you're building a new PC, but chasing additional PCIe Gen 5 support for secondary SSDs is probably not worth it for most people either. Outside of niche workloads like 8K video editing or huge data transfers, the benefits of PCIe 5.0 storage are hard to notice in daily use. And let's not forget their thermal limits. That's why it's better to focus on motherboard features that impact your daily experience rather than obsessing over PCIe specs alone.
User-friendly BIOS
It makes fine-tuning and troubleshooting a whole lot easier
Most people tend to overlook a motherboard's BIOS since you'll rarely ever need to go there, but the moment you run into a problem, you'll realize how much of a difference a user-friendly BIOS can actually make. There's a reason I keep buying Asus motherboards, and itâ€™s not just for the flashy ROG logo. I genuinely like Asus' BIOS layout because it's clean, easy to understand, and offers quality-of-life features that make troubleshooting and tuning so much easier. Take something as simple as enabling the XMP or EXPO profiles for your memory. On some motherboards, it's a single toggle, whereas on others, you'll have to dig through multiple menus just to get your RAM running at its advertised speed. Fan curve control is another example; on my Asus motherboard, I can simply drag and drop points on the fan speed curve, which is far more convenient than typing in percentages. All in all, a polished BIOS layout saves you a lot of unnecessary frustration when you're troubleshooting your PC.
Fan headers and heatsinks
Prioritizing cooling options will pay off in the long run
As someone who lives in a hot country and wants my components to run at a relatively cool temperature, I can't afford to overlook cooling support on a motherboard. I usually check how many fan headers it comes with before I even look at the PCIe specs. Budget boards often cut corners here, giving you just three or four fan headers, which may not be enough if you're building in a mid-tower or full-tower case with multiple intakes, exhausts, and a 360mm radiator. Sure, you can always get a splitter or fan hub, but that's still an additional purchase, and it limits your ability to control fans individually. Likewise, robust VRM heatsinks ensure that your power delivery components don't overheat when your CPU is under heavy load. Even at stock settings, modern 8-core, 12-core, and 16-core CPUs can push weak VRMs to their limits and cause stability issues. M.2 heatsinks are just as important today, considering how hot PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 SSDs can get. Without proper cooling, your expensive Gen 5 SSD may struggle to maintain anywhere close to its advertised speeds. While you can find SSDs with integrated heatsinks, they typically cost more and don't always fit neatly under a GPU.
I/O and networking
More ports and faster connectivity mean fewer compromises
If there's one thing that makes a motherboard limiting in day-to-day use, it's a weak I/O layout. For instance, some mid-range B850 boards have eight ports on the rear, which may be adequate for some, but if you're a gamer who plans to connect various accessories like a wireless headset, wireless gaming mouse, external speakers, flash drive, and webcam, these ports will fill up really fast. Once you add a game controller or a studio microphone into the mix, you'll find yourself short on connections and relying on hubs. That's why I always prioritize boards that offer 10 or more ports so I don't feel limited down the line. Premium X870 boards also offer faster USB4 ports, which go a long way toward future-proofing your I/O. Networking is another area that makes a motherboard feel modern. Most B850 and X870 boards already come with 2.5GbE ports as standard, but if you're someone who moves large files across a NAS or home server, some pricier boards offer 5GbE and 10GbE for added flexibility. And if you plan to connect your PC to the internet wirelessly, make sure you get a board with Wi-Fi 6E or 7. Some budget B850 boards lack onboard Wi-Fi, so you'll either have to rely on an Ethernet connection or spend $25-50 on an adapter that takes up another USB port.
Don't cut corners chasing PCIe 5.0 support
PCIe 5.0 is surely a cutting-edge feature, but it isn't as important as many people make it seem. For most gaming and everyday workloads, PCIe 5.0 doesn't make a noticeable difference just yet. So, instead of fixating on PCIe 5.0 support, prioritize the features that can improve your experience today, like a user-friendly BIOS, adequate fan headers and heatsinks for proper cooling, and plenty of rear I/O for your peripherals. If you really want to future-proof your PC, a motherboard that offers PCIe 5.0 support for the GPU and primary SSD is more than enough. A secondary drive that runs at PCIe 4.0 speeds won't bottleneck your system in any meaningful way. The money you save can go toward more critical components in your build, such as your CPU and GPU.

Right, who needs BIOS flash and debug lights, they're not useful whatsoever, right?
