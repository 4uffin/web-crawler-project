Summary
Monitors shared laundry machines so you stop wasting trips hauling clothes down stairs.
Four XIAO NRF52840s sample audio every minute and send the data to a Particle Tachyon, which updates a web page via cellular.
Microphones detect wider sounds (such as hoses and cycle stages), so no machine modifications are needed.
I don't know about you, but I have to stay extra vigilant when it comes to fetching my laundry. All it takes is one moment where I tune out for a little while, and I find myself sorting through stone-cold clothes that have been sitting in the washer-dryer for an hour.
Fortunately, we have technology to help us where our brains fail. People have invented systems that inform them when their laundry is done, such as this system that listens for the washing machine's finishing tune and notifies them on Telegram. Now, someone has taken it a step further by creating a system that allows them to check the current status of their washing and drying machines, so they never waste a trip again.

As spotted by Hackster.io, this project was born from the same inspiration that has caused countless inventors to pick up their tools and find a solution: getting really annoyed by seemingly simple-to-fix issues. In this case, our story begins with Guy Dupont on X, who takes some time to explain their problem and how they fixed it. So, here's the issue Guy had. They live in an apartment block, sharing a pair of washing machines and dryers among 16 people. Getting the laundry done is a miniature gamble: sometimes there's a machine free for them to use, and sometimes they lug all their dirty clothes down flights of stairs only to find all the machines are taken. So, they needed a way to see if the machines were in use from the comfort of their apartment. Because they rent, they couldn't secure more machines, nor did they have permission to modify them. Being a tinkerer at heart, they decided to design a system that let him monitor each machine without enraging their landlord. They decided to grab four XIAO NRF52840s and stick them to the sides of the machines, then told them to take audio samples from each machine every minute. The XIAOs beam their findings over BLE to a hidden Particle Tachyon, which processes the audio readings and determines the stage of the cycle the machine is in. It then beams the information over cellular data (because the Wi-Fi range doesn't reach Guy's apartment) to a web page that updates Guy on which machines are in use, and how long they've been going. Now, you may wonder: why not use an accelerometer or a vibration sensor to detect when the machine is finished? Well, Guy Dupont had thought of that, and they explain their reasoning thusly:
Guy also responded to several questions pitched to them on X, so if this setup is making you think "But what about this solution," be sure to check the replies to see if they already covered that. Trust me, people have already tried poking holes in the replies, so there's a good chance your critique has been addressed as well. Despite that, I don't see why you can't adapt this system to remind yourself of your own laundry machine finishing. It'd certainly save me from wearing wrinkly clothes.

Neat. I'd have done the microphone route and called it good but this is a better solution . One of these things that is easy to ask how to do it better but hardly anyone had the idea in the first place
