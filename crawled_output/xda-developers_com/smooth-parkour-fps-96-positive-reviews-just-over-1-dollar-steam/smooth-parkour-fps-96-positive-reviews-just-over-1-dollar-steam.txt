What's cooler than an FPS with a solid movement system? Trick question, there is nothing. If an FPS lets you jump around the arena and parkour to your heart's content, it usually gets a pretty high rating from me. There's a good reason why I fell in love with Titanfall 2, and it wasn't just because of the mechs. If you're like me and want to jump, slide, and shoot your way through waves of enemies, Severed Steel is currently on a huge sale on Steam. It's currently 95% off and costs just over $1, so if you're itching for your next fave game, this may be your best bet.
Severed Steel is just $1.29 on Steam right now
If you've never heard of the game before, Severed Steel is all about taking down baddies and looking good while doing it. It also features a cool voxel system, which lets you shoot chunks out of the scenery. Think the Matrix lobby scene, except it's faster and more cyberpunk. Here's how the devs describe the game:
Severed Steel is a single-player FPS featuring a fluid stunt system, destructible voxel environments, loads of bullet time, and a unique one-armed protagonist. It's you, your trigger finger, and a steel-toed boot against a superstructure full of bad guys. Chain together wall runs, dives, flips, and slides to take every last enemy down.
Play as Steel, a nimble, one-armed sharpshooter on a mission. There is no reloading – pick your shots well and be ready to pry a loaded weapon from your enemies' cold dead hands. Dodge bullets, leap off walls, slide kick, throw weapons – do whatever it takes to come out on top in intense and frenzied firefights. Punch through thick concrete with .50 cal slugs, or make big holes in things with your arm cannon. Carve your own path through completely destructible levels.
Sounds good, right? Well, it seems that Steam's players agree. At the time of writing, the game is enjoying a lifetime review score of 96% positive reviews, which is pretty rare for games to have. And if you're still on the fence, you can't go wrong with its price tag of just $1.29 on Steam for a limited time. You have until September 27th to grab it, so that's plenty of time to make your mind up. And if you want more first-person goodness, check out these classic Doom-like FPS games we loved playing after growing up in the 90s.
