With IFA 2025 just around the corner, people from around the world are keeping a close eye on Berlin to see the latest and hottest tech on display. However, some companies can't wait to show off their hardware and have given us a sneak peek at what we can expect from the event. One such company is Acer, which gave us the low-down on everything it's bringing to IFA 2025's tables this year. Regardless of whether you're someone who works on a budget or you're ready to shell out for a powerful gaming PC, Acer has something for you to check out.
The Acer Nitro and Predator range has something for gamers and demanding professionals alike
First up, we have the Predator and Nitro range. These are both angled toward the gaming market, but as you'll see very soon, it's more than just something to play the hottest titles on. The Nitro range gets a wave of welcome additions to its lineup. There's the Acer Nitro V 16 and 16S, a pair of laptops that boast up to an Intel Core i9-2700H and an RTX 5070, coming out this October starting at $999.99. There's also the Acer Nitro 70 and 50 gaming PCs, which sport an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D processor with an RTX 5090 and a Ryzen 7 8700G processor with an RTX 5080, respectively. Both of these are TBA on their US price and release date, so keep an eye out. The Predator range is where things begin to merge with the professional world. While the Helios 18P AI laptop utilizes an Ultra 9 285H processor and an RTX 5090, which allows for gaming on the go, Acer also places a strong emphasis on utilizing it for graphically intensive tasks, such as 3D modeling. For desktop fans, the Predator Orion 7000 and 5000 fit the bill nicely, packing up to an Ultra 9 285K, an RTX 5090, and a whopping 128GB of RAM. The Helios 18P starts at $3,999.99, with no US date or price confirmed for the Orions yet.
Acer also shows off its brand new Chromebooks
If you're not one to shell out on the mighiest devices on the market, Acer has a nice range of Chromebooks to check out, too. The Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 features 50 TOPS of processing power, which is quite impressive, considering it was a major marketing point for powerful processors just a year ago. You can use those TOPS to perform AI-related tasks, and Acer will even give users the chance to sign up for a complimentary 12-month plan to Google AI Pro. You'll see the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 pop up on US shelves this October for $699.99. Acer is also releasing two Chromeboxes, which are miniature PCs more suited for static use. The Acer Chromebox CXI6 features an Intel Core i7-1500U processor and five USB ports, while the Acer Chromebox Mini CXM2 utilizes an Intel Core i3 N350 with a fanless design that keeps things remarkably quiet. The CXI6 will sell for $749.99 in December, and the Mini CXM2 will arrive in Q1 2026 for $329.99.

I had acers in the past ! they remind me of my current hp laptops the last few years.I might give acer a look in consideration when purchasing my upcoming replacement laptop . I liked their classic simple design . They were nice to look at and worked great too !Hp is more consistent and has more updates to their bios and certain chipset hardware software drivers . Hp is very stable too . my prior acers were very reliable as well !
