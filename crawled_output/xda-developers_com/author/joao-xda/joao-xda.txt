About João Carrasqueira
João has been covering the tech world for over 7 years, with a heavy focus on laptops and the Windows ecosystem. I also love all things tech and videogames, especially Nintendo, which he's always happy to talk about.
Prior to joining XDA in 2021, he worked at Neowin: https://www.neowin.net/news/poster/jo%C3%A3o-carrasqueira/
What was your first computer?
It's been a long time, but I remember having an old Compaq desktop PC running Windows XP, which was the family computer in my house. It had a 20GB hard drive and, if my memory serves, 512MB of RAM, yet it allowed me to play some of the games I remember most fondly, such as Rollcage and Lego Racers.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I've been interested in tech for as long as I can remember, whether it's computers or phones. I'd always look for ways to enhance the performance of my computer or try new versions of Windows, and I joined the Windows Insider Program the day the first build was released.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I love all things tech, and Windows has always been my home, so both software and hardware are things that interest me deeply. I'm also a huge fan of console gaming, with a big focus on Nintendo, whose games have a level of charm that most other companies don't replicate, despite their lesser technical prowess.
