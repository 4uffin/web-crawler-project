About Timi Cantisano
Timi has been writing about technology for over a decade, focusing on smartphones, computers, and anything that he finds interesting in the space. He started writing for XDA, covering all things mobile, but has transitioned to covering deals, with a mission to shed light on some of the best discounts around the internet on the greatest tech products.
What was your first computer?
Something by IBM that the family used for work but was borrowed frequently to play games like Oregon Trail, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?, and Rampage.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I've always loved tech, but if I'm nailing down a specific timeframe, it would be when I bought my first cell phone with the Nokia 5190. Software flashing, modded covers, and soldering colored LEDs opened up a new world for me and I haven't looked back since.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
PCs, smartphones, and portable game consoles are my jam these days. While I'm not as hardcore as I used to be, I love learning about what's new in these spaces, and will often make bad purchase decisions out of my love for the product categories.
