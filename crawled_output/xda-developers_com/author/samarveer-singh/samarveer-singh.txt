About Samarveer Singh
Gaming has been Samarveer’s greatest passion, and the Literature graduate in him takes immense joy in dissecting games for their themes, messages, and impact. Samarveer holds a deep appreciation of gaming, and considers the platform to be the most immersive and impactful across all media. He can be found engaging with gaming communities online, always ready to debate the finer points of ray tracing or itching to write an 8-page collegiate thesis on any game that impacts him emotionally.
How long have you been interested in technology?
Tech and gaming have always gone hand-in-hand for me. Ever since I was two and began playing Midtown Madness 2, that yellow Beetle, and the PC it ran on, became my entire life.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
If it can run Doom, I'm going to be obsessed with it. Apart from gaming PCs, I love gaming consoles, mobiles, headphones, and automobiles. A personal piece of tech I'm fervently passionate about is my DIY PS5 Portal.
