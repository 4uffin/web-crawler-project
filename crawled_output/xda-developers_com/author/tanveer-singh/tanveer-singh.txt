About Tanveer Singh
After a 7-year corporate stint, Tanveer found his love for writing and tech too much to resist. An MBA in Marketing and the owner of a PC building business, he writes on PC hardware, technology, and Windows. When not scouring the web for ideas, he can be found building PCs, watching anime, or playing Smash Karts on his RTX 3080 (sigh).
What was your first computer?
My first ever PC was a pre-built from HP called HP Brio with an Intel Pentium 3 processor, 64MB of RAM, and a 9.4GB HDD.
How long have you been interested in technology?
As far as I can recall, I've been interested in everything tech since I was 8 years old.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
Being a PC builder myself, gaming PCs interest me the most. Besides that, I love mobiles, high-end TVs, and home automation technology.
