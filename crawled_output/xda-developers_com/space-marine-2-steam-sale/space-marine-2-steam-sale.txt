This must-have title for Warhammer 40,000 fans is down to its lowest price ever on Steam

Warhammer 40,000 is probably the most popular tabletop wargame in the world, but it doesn't stop there. The universe and its lore have broken free of the tabletop and now have a huge array of novels, TV shows, and video games covering the IP. The games in particular can come in a wild variety of genres, including strategy, shooters, and even racing games. One of the franchise's more popular titles is the Space Marine series, where you take control of one of the titular warriors of mankind to fight off any threat (and trust me, there are a lot of threats). If you've wanted to give the newest entry a try but felt it was a little too pricey for your liking, it's currently on the lowest price we've ever seen it reach on Steam.
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is 50% off on Steam, its lowest price yet
If you've never heard of the series, the Space Marine games lets you play as mankind's strongest warriors in the 41st millennium. The first game has you fighting off the Orks and some Chaos, and this one has you fighting off the Tyranids and even more Chaos. Here's how the game describes itself:
Embody the superhuman skill and brutality of a Space Marine. Unleash deadly abilities and devastating weaponry to obliterate the relentless Tyranid swarms. Defend the Imperium in spectacular third-person action in solo or multiplayer modes.
Fight the enemies of Mankind as Lieutenant Demetrian Titus in this sequel to 2011’s Space Marine, and prove your loyalty once again as you are reinstated to the Ultramarines. Hold at bay the horrors of the galaxy in epic battles on far-flung planets and uncover dark secrets to drive back the everlasting night.
If you want to give it a shot yourself, be sure to head over to Steam and grab it while it's 50%, the steepest discount we've seen yet. You've got until September 15th until the deal vanishes, so don't dawdle on this one.
