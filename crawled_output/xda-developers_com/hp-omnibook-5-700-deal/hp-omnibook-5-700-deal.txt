It's easy to get carried away with laptop specifications when you're looking for something new. But if there are some rules to follow, it's to buy something that has slightly better specs than what you'll need and to find that at a price that you can afford. Luckily, we've been seeing some pretty good laptop deals lately, and this OmniBook 5 from HP hits all the right marks, and is now down to just $700 for a very limited time.
This laptop is better than a Surface Laptop and more affordable
This is a laptop that looks and feels good, while also providing all the power you need to get everything done. It has a vibrant and sharp 14-inch 2K OLED touchscreen and is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus chip. You also get 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. And if you want AI features, this laptop is plenty capable with support for Copilot+. HP also throws in its own AI tools, which some people might find interesting. When it comes to connectivity, you get two USB-C, one USB-A, and a 3.5mm audio jack. There's also charging up to 65W, with quick charging that will take it from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes. The laptop also packs a 1080p camera for video calls, and has dual speakers to become the entertainment powerhouse you need if you're on the road. It weighs in at under 3 pounds and measures in at 0.5 inches thick. As we stated in our first look, it offers incredible value for anyone that's shopping for a new laptop. So if youv'e been thinking about grabbing something new, give this one a serious look at $700.
