Summary
Microsoft introduces the new Outlook, highlighting its modern features, Copilot, security, and performance.
Many users find it lacks key classic features, prompting some to keep the old client or switch.
Microsoft is gradually adding features; it may take a year or two for users to fully adopt them.
Have you given the new Outlook client a try? If you have, you may have noticed that it's perhaps not as great as the older client. Which is unfortunate, as when Microsoft announced the new Outlook, it sounded like a home run on paper, but it didn't really pan out as well as I'd hoped. Well, Microsoft, being Microsoft, is refusing to back down from the changes it made to its email client. In fact, it has just published an entire article on why you should stop caring about that boring old client and embrace the new one with vim and vigor.
Microsoft wants to tempt you to use the new Outlook with added features
In a post titled "Experience the future: Switch to new Outlook for Windows today!" Microsoft explains all the reasons why you should make the swap. While people complained that the new client didn't contain as many features as the old one, it seems to be trying to fix that:
To meet the needs of modern workflows, we’ve designed the updated Outlook for Windows with agility, consistency, and manageability in mind, making it easier to achieve stability, performance, and security – and to deliver features never before available in classic Outlook.
Now, you can enjoy top-requested capabilities like:
Pin important emails
Sort and search for attendees
Apply new themes and colored mailbox folders
Add shared mailboxes as accounts
Use Copilot-powered inbox prioritization and email drafting
Create structured, professional, and richly formatted newsletters
and so much more!
The company also spends some time breaking down how you can upgrade to the new Outlook, just in case you wanted to give it a try. Unfortunately, the new Outlook did not receive much praise. People found that the new client didn't contain all the features of the old one, which caused some people to stick with the previous version, or worse, migrate to a different client altogether. In fact, one of our own writers recently uninstalled Outlook and headed over to a different client, and they've been a lot happier with their decision. It appears that Microsoft is continually adding new features to the latest Outlook. Hopefully, in a year (or two), the company will have finally gotten it to the point where people will want to use it over the old client. Until then, it will struggle to find many people willing to give up their neatly arranged inboxes for something that isn't quite complete yet.

The New Outlook has ads that look like new email messages but do not show up on my other devices that check the same service.
Obviously just ads to use the app.
It's a No Go.

This is true, I uninstalled this thing so many times, but it is like a ad rash, it keeps coming back, I do not understand Microsoft problem the focusing on shoving ads all over Windows it is a joke, the ads that look like messages is spamy if you ask me, in my oponion Thunderbird is way faster and better than this, and they dont hide ads on the program like Microsoft does.
