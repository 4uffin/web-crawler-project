I added my project and meeting notes to NotebookLM and the results were wild

Do you often deal with endless project documents and meeting notes? You are not alone. We have all been there where our digital folders overflow with forgotten insights. The information is there, but finding a specific detail or connecting the dots between different areas can feel like an impossible task. So, when I learned about NotebookLM’s capabilities, I was skeptical. Could it really handle the chaos? I decided to put it to the test. I uploaded a heap of my project files and meeting notes from the last few months, and what it did with them was genuinely surprising.
My current workflow with project and meeting notes
A combination of Google Docs and Obsidian
My current workflow for managing project and meeting notes is a bit of a hybrid system. For anything that needs to be shared with my team or clients, Google Docs is my go-to. It’s the standard for our projects where real-time collaboration is invaluable. Google Docs is ideal for meeting agendas, action items, and general project documentation that everyone needs to access and edit. The ease of sharing and commenting makes it perfect for the day-to-day work where transparency is key. However, when I’m working on something confidential or just need a personal space for my own thoughts and research, I turn to Obsidian. This is where I keep my notes on projects that require a lot of deep thinking. I love how Obsidian lets me link ideas together and build a network of knowledge that’s entirely my own. It feels more secure and personal. The duel system works for me.
Creating notebooks in NotebookLM
Adding notes with a single click
Over time, this dual-system workflow creates a challenge. My Google Docs and Obsidian files begin to multiply. I will have one Google Docs for the Project Kick-off Meeting, another for Client Feedback Session #1, and a third for Website Wireframe Revision. Meanwhile, in my Obsidian vault, I have personal notes for competitive analysis, design inspiration, and my own coding experiments for the same project. After a few weeks, all of this information becomes a massive, unsearchable blob. This is exactly where NotebookLM became my saving grace. I was in the middle of a complex website redesign project. My notes were a mess. I had several Google Docs from various team and client meetings and Markdown files for brainstorming design ideas and backend solutions. I needed to find a specific comment the client made about the color palette in one of the documents, but I couldn’t remember which one. Instead of spending hours digging through each file, I decided to upload all of them to NotebookLM. Since NotebookLM supports Google Docs and Markdown files, I created a new notebook for the project and uploaded all these files in a matter of seconds. The best part is that NotebookLM supports PDF files as well. I can even add client contracts, agreements, and other PDF files right into the same notebook.
Getting insights from my uploaded notes
NotebookLM nails it here
Once all my website project documents were uploaded to NotebookLM, it was like they were instantly transformed into a single brain. This is where the magic truly begins. I didn’t need to navigate a folder structure or use a clunky search bar. Instead, I could just start a conversation with my own notes. The interface has a chat-like window, and I can ask anything I want. The answers it provides are not generic summaries; they are directly sourced from the documentation I uploaded. Even better, every answer comes with a citation that shows exactly which document the information came from. I can click on it and be taken to the original source in a flash. For my website redesign project, there are the kinds of questions I started asking.
What are Swami Jewel's primary markets?
What were the key client feedback points from the July 15th meeting?
Summarize the technical requirements for the user login system.
Find all the mentions of the project deadlines and give me a timeline.
I remember a note about integrating an e-commerce platform. What were the specific platforms we discussed?
Each time, NotebookLM provided a concise, accurate answer, complete with links back to the Google Doc or Obsidian Markdown file. It eliminated the frustration of digging through files and allowed me to use my own project history as a searchable resource. While I don’t use it personally, you can even go ahead and generate audio overviews for your projects (it’s useful for specific scenarios only).
That AI that gets my notes
When I started this experiment, I was just hoping NotebookLM would help me find a specific detail faster. But what I got was so much more. It didn’t just organize my notes, it transformed them. Now, NotebookLM has become an active partner in my work. The ability to instantly ask questions, generate summaries, and find connections across dozens of documents has changed how I prep for a client meeting or start a new project. So what are you waiting for? Upload a few of your most complex documents and ask a simple question. The answer might just blow your mind.

This sounds more productive than having it summarize explicit rap songs or XXX clip audio. Not as fun more productive though.
