I wish Linux were better on tablets
I've been trying a lot of different things lately when it comes to Linux and operating systems, and earlier this week, I went hands-on with FydeOS on an old 2-in-1 laptop. Suffice it to say, it's easily the best experience you can get on a tablet-like PC, with great, smooth interactions and gestures.
I had a lot of hope that more mainstream Linux distros would have developed better support for tablets, but with the market being relatively small to begin with, I can understand why that's not the case. But with Microsoft fumbling the bag so hard when it comes to... everything, I wish there were more alternatives. That being said, FydeOS is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

A virtualization-optimized version of Windows 11 would be awesome
Recently, I found out about a project called WinApps that attempts to run Windows apps on Linux in a seamless way, making them appear integrated into the native desktop. This relies on a full Windows VM paired with a remote desktop tool, but Windows is a hefty OS to run in the background for a setup like this.
It got me thinking it would be a cool idea if Microsoft made a Windows ISO image designed for tinkerers who want to use lightweight VMs or containers, where you can still run all the Windows apps, but without the usual background processes Windows comes with. It would make it way easier to ditch full Windows installs for good.

Nintendo has another hour-long show coming this week
Nintendo has just announced its first "general" Nintendo Direct since it launched the Switch 2 over three months ago, and suffice it to say, it feels like it's going to be a banger. Partly because Nintendo skipped its usual June showcase, which means we're overdue for a deluge of Nintendo news, but also because Nintendo is kind of promising exactly that.
According to the company, this will be a roughly 60-minute long show, which makes it the longest general Direct ever, if we exclude the April showcase that was exclusively focused on revealing the Switch 2 and its launch lineup. There are no expected hardware announcements this time around, so it's all about the games (and maybe the sequel to the Mario movie), which makes it all the more exciting.

Donkey Kong Bananza is a true next-gen experience
The Nintendo Switch 2 is just over a month old, but with the launch of Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo has already shown it has what it takes to make a true next-gen game experience. I've only had the chance to play it for about one hour, but it's amazing how quickly this game gives you a sense of "I don't know how they would ever have done this on previous hardware".
Sure, Mario Kart World's interconnected world would need a lot of sacrifices on the original Switch, but the sheer amount of destruction you can cause in Donkey Kong Banaza is incredible. The entire world is yours to smash, crash, and bash as you please, and it all responds perfectly. Making use of voxel technology in such an ambitious way really elevates this game and shows off the hardware's capabilities in a way you might not immediately think of. Plus, the game looks gorgeous, too.

It's been 40 years since Super Mario Bros. came out and the titular plumber is still going strong
Seriously, 40 years is a long time, and Mario has been curbstomping Goombas for every minute of it. Whether he's running around with his brother Luigi or pairing up with dinosaurs, talking hats and more, Mario has been a part of the gaming landscape for young, and the young-at-heart. I can't wait for the next outing (and his first on the Nintendo Switch 2), because I've played every game to date and Nintendo's first-party titles are always worth picking up. Is Mario your favorite or is another Nintendo character in that top slot?

Virtual Boy games are coming to the Switch 2 and I am losing my mind
Nintendo has just held its latest Direct showcase going over numerous upcoming games for the Switch and Switch 2. There were some great announcements in there, but none shocked me more than the addition of Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Classics library on both Switch and Switch 2.
The Virtual Boy is infamously Nintendo's worst selling console hardware, recorded at 770,000 units sold worldwide, though the hardware was never launched in Europe. This addition to the Nintendo Classics library is also going to require an add-on that pretty much replicates the look of that original hardware, and it'll be available in all major markets, meaning it's more than likely it will sell more than the original hardware.
I'm just absolutely befuddled that this is happening now, when Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to re-release these games on the 3DS and never did it. But there's no way around the fact that this is at least interesting.

Rolling releases vs. fixed releases: Which do you prefer?
I've long used fixed-released operating systems that require major upgrades to bring the underlying code up to scratch with the latest updates that aren't minor. In recent times, I've gradually moved to rolling-release Linux distros and much prefer being able to update just about every part of the OS without having to wait for the developers to roll out a major upgrade. But which do you prefer?
