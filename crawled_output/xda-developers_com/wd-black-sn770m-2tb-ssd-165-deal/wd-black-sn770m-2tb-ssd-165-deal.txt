Western Digital WD Black SN770M
Western Digital's WD Black SN770M is a 2230-sized SSD that can claim to be one of the fastest in its form factor. It's particularly great for higher-end handhelds like the ROG Ally, which can take advantage of its PCIe 4.0 speeds.

Not all SSDs are the same, and we're not just talking about performance here. There are different types, but the more common version you'll see in laptops, desktops, and other products right now are M.2 SSDs. Even with M.2 SSDs, there are different keys and sizes, which can make things confusing if you're looking to upgrade.
While the 2280 is the most common one you'll see, the 2230 is also quite popular as well, being used in smaller devices that still need great performance. We've seen the 2230 SSD being used more and more, in devices like the Surface, and PC gaming handhelds. This one from Western Digital is part of its WD Black series.
That means you're not only getting reliable storage, but you're also getting great performance as well. When it comes to performance numbers, you're looking at speeds up to 5,150MB/s. The SSD also comes with a five-year warranty from Western Digital, which is good to know if you need support later down the line. As far as what you get with this SSD, that's pretty much it. Of course, we wouldn't even be mentioning this SSD if it wasn't for the price. For a limited time, you can score a nice discount that brings this down to $165. It's one of the best prices we've seen in quite some time, making it a good time to pick one up. Just be quick about because this deal won't last.
