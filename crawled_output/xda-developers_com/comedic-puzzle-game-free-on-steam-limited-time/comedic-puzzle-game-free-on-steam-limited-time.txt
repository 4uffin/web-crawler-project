This comedic puzzle game is free on Steam for a limited time

We've seen a few good sales on Steam lately (such as
this popular military sim going as low as $3), but when you're talking pure value for money, you really can't go wrong with free. Steam often hosts "play for free" events, where people can try out a game without paying a cent, with the caveat that it's only available for a short amount of time, after which you'll need to buy it. However, very rarely, we'll see a game go "free to keep", which means that if you grab it during its promotional window, you own it—forever.
Well, if you're looking for a comedic puzzle game, Steam has just the thing for you. A title called "Puzzle Chambers" has just become free to keep, but you'll need to be quick before it reverts to a paid title again.
Puzzle Chambers is free to keep forever until September 19th
Puzzle Chambers is an odd title; it was released back in December 2017, but I've only just learned of its existence today. The premise seems really interesting; a group of people finds themselves in a strange place where they must solve puzzles to figure out what's going on. Here's how the developers describe it:
After waking up in a mysterious place, you quickly discover three things:
-Everyone there has supernatural abilities.
-It’s not a safe place.
-And your hosts are either aliens, monsters from another dimension, or seriously messed up human beings.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem its interesting design choices resonated too well with players. At the time of writing, it has a 74% positive rating, with people praising the writing and the story but finding the actual puzzles a little lackluster. Regardless, if you think it's an interesting premise, you can always head over to the Puzzle Chambers Steam page and give it a go without paying anything. However, don't dawdle; the game will only stay free to keep until September 19th, so as long as you add it to your library before then, you'll have it forever. And if that's not enough, check out the best puzzle games on Steam.
