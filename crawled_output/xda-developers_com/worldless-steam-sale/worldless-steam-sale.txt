This overwhelmingly positive-rated hidden gem on Steam is at its lowest price ever

It's not every day we see a huge discount on a game I haven't heard of before now. It's even rarer that the game has "overwhelmingly positive" reviews—that's a rating of 95% or higher—and yet somehow managed to slip my radar. And yet, here we are with Worldless, a game I've literally learned about five minutes ago because it's on the biggest sale Steam has ever seen. Well, I guess you learn something new every day.
Worldless is 60% off on Steam, and it even comes with a demo
Over on Steam, Worldless is currently enjoying a 60% discount, the lowest we've ever seen it go. Its most-used tags are "2D Platformer," "Difficult," "Metroidvania," and "Female Protagonist," so if you're already tired of Silksong, this sounds like a lovely replacement. Joking aside, the game's art direction is stunning, and the combat looks super explosive and full of opportunities to learn attack patterns and turn your enemy's attacks against them. It's likely why Worldless has 95% positive reviews in its two years of release; whatever it's doing, it's doing it well. Here's how the developers describe the game:
Worldless unfolds in a newborn universe where entities are locked in an eternal conflict fueled by the polarizing nature of their attractions. These encounters can trigger an unstable exchange of polarities with transformations that are unpredictable and full of mysterious consequences.
In this stylized 2D active turn based platformer, you will explore intricate and interconnected realms brimming with secrets and mysteries. Master a rich set of abilities such as dashing and wall jumping to traverse these abstract landscapes.
If that sounds like a blast (I know it does to me), then pop over to the Worldless Steam page for more information. The game comes with a demo, so if you're still on the fence, you can give it a spin and see if it's for you. If you like what you try, then you can grab the full version at 60% off for $7.99 until September 20th. That should be plenty of time to give the game a spin and see if it's to your liking.
