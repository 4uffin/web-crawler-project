<![CDATA[Windows handheld gamers can unlock the new "Xbox mode" early: here's how]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-handheld-gamers-unlock-xbox-mode-early/Simon BattGaming HandheldWindows 11
It involves installing a version of Windows 11 that hasn't been released yet.
<p>Right now, we're witnessing an arms race between Microsoft and Valve. For a while, the two had been content in their own camps; Valve had its Steam Deck, and Microsoft had delivered Windows 11 to other handheld PCs. However, things began to escalate when Valve released the Steam Deck's operating system, SteamOS, for general use on any handheld device. Not only that, but Valve began actively fixing bugs and creating patches for specific non-Deck models, including some that were previously Windows-only.</p>

Fancy trying out cloud gaming?
<p>Borderlands 4 is now out in the wild, and there's a lot to love and criticize. While people are complaining about the performance issues, it seems they're also gelling with the actual meat and potatoes of the game. In fact, our delightful sister website, <a href="https://screenrant.com/borderlands-4-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GameRant</a>, gave Gearbox's latest title a highly respectable 9/10 score, citing performance as a minor ding but praising the writing, gunplay, and seamless multiplayer experience.</p>

Obsidian's flexibility and plugin ecosystem are its greatest strengths, but relying heavily on third-party plugins carries risks of breakage, compatibility issues, and overwhelming choice for new users. A stronger core feature set could provide a more stable foundation.
<p>I still use Obsidian because, despite its flaws, it gives me control. Everything lives in local markdown files, and I can link notes the way I want. I don’t have to pay for a subscription or a cloud platform. <span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">Additionally, one of my favorite built-in features is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-visualize-your-notes-in-obsidian-with-graph-view/" target="_blank">Graph View</a>, which allows me to visualize how I've connected all my notes and makes it visually appealing</span>. What bothers me is how many of Obsidian’s features depend on plugins.</p>

DPI, polling rate, and "High-Res Audio" are all features you don't need to care about.
<p>Every PC gaming peripheral seems to hinge on marketing with impressive numbers; numbers like 32,000 DPI, 8,000 Hz polling, or a 0.1 ms response time. On paper these specs sound like game-changers (and they're easy to market), but in reality most are just marketing fluff beyond a certain point. Gamers have been led to chase ever-higher metrics that don't actually improve gameplay in any meaningful way, and as proof of that, you'll find that professional players in esports titles have also identified these metrics simply don't matter.</p>

They weren’t the heroes you played, but they were the ones you’ll never forget. These NPCs defined what gaming could feel like.
<p>In gaming, NPC might stand for non-player characters, but the truth is, they are just as important as the player characters themselves. After all, it's NPCs who, through their writing, behaviors, and stories, make questlines, narratives, and experiences unforgettable. They lend credence to game worlds, giving our stories weight and personality, and sometimes, it just so happens that they end up stealing the spotlight, cementing themselves in our brains forever.</p>

Boost your Mac's utility with these neat Raycast extensions
<p>Ever since I got my MacBook earlier this year, I’ve been experimenting with different apps and tools that I could never run on my Windows, Linux, and even Hackintosh setups. This includes everything from the macOS-exclusive Affinity software stack to macOS’ new containerization platform with the unimaginative name of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/apple-container-turned-my-mac-into-a-self-hosting-war-machine/" target="_blank">Apple Container</a>.</p>

Because sticky notes only go so far
<p>I’ve lost count of how many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/discovered-open-source-productivity-app-replaced-notion/" target="_blank">productivity apps</a> I’ve tried. They all promise to fix my scattered brain, but many just end up overcomplicating things. Between syncing, paywalls, and 50 different “views”, I often end up spending more time managing the tool than getting work done. All I really need is something to help me keep track of the stuff I usually forget and organize it in a digestible way, without turning it into a second job.</p>

With a history linked to controversial distros like LinuxFX and Wubuntu, Winux may not be the best choice for a secure, reliable Linux experience.
<p>Tired of Windows 11 but want to keep using a desktop operating system that resembles Microsoft's design language? There are a few choices available within the Linux community. You have the option of using a tailor-made distro with all the necessary bells and whistles preinstalled, or you can choose one of the many available to serve as a solid and secure foundation for creating your own Windows-like Linux-powered OS. What you shouldn't do, however, is use Winux. I downloaded this OS after seeing it covered by esteemed publications, and I'm struggling to see the appeal.</p>
