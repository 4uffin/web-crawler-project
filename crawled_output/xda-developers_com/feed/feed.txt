<![CDATA[Tablet vs e-reader vs e-ink notepad: The easy way to choose the right one]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/tablet-vs-e-reader-vs-e-ink-notepad-choose-right-one-for-you/Stevie BonifieldOther

Trying to choose between a Kindle, ReMarkable tablet, and an iPad? Here's an easy guide to help you decide.
<p>When I was thinking about getting my first e-reader, I kept coming back to the same question: why not just get a tablet? After all, a tablet, like an iPad, can do a lot more than an e-reader. And what about e-ink notepads like the ReMarkable tablet? They’re more expensive than e-readers, but offer more versatility for note-taking and annotating what you’re reading.</p>

Discover how Donetick, a self-hosted app for managing personal tasks and chores, became an indispensable tool in the author's daily routine despite initial doubts.
<p>Earlier this year, I decided to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/self-hosting-donetick-for-chores/" target="_blank">try out Donetick to help me with my chores</a>. While my experience with the app was positive, I often find that I stop using many self-hosted services after some time. This is partly due to my becoming overwhelmed when switching between too many apps and my general resistance to changing my routine.</p>

Grab it before the deal vanishes.
<p>We've seen a few good sales on Steam lately (such as <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1023313"><a href="/beloved-military-sim-91-positive-reviews-3-dollars-on-steam/" target="_blank">this popular military sim</a></span> going as low as $3), but when you're talking pure value for money, you really can't go wrong with free. Steam often hosts "play for free" events, where people can try out a game without paying a cent, with the caveat that it's only available for a short amount of time, after which you'll need to buy it. However, very rarely, we'll see a game go "free to keep", which means that if you grab it during its promotional window, you own it—forever.</p>

Eden Emulator arrives on mobile.
<p>Nintendo is often embroiled in a battle against pirates and individuals who emulate its games. Every new hardware generation, Nintendo adds some new countermeasures to protect its systems, and people find a way to circumvent them. It ends up being an arms race until Nintendo pulls out the strongest counter-attack it can muster: full-blown legal action.</p>

The quest for the perfect read-it-later app ends here
<p>After relying on Pocket for years, I found myself in a familiar dilemma when it announced its shutdown: finding a new home for my endless "to-read" list. I tried dozens of alternatives, from big-name apps to smaller services, but nothing felt right. They were all either too messy, too confusing, or they just didn't have the features I needed. It seemed impossible to find a service that truly felt like my own.</p>

Discover how LatencyMon, a real-time audio processing tool, can help diagnose and fix underlying issues causing your PC to slow down and stutter.
<p>I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of my life chasing down the ghosts in my machines. You know, the intermittent stutter, dropped frames, and the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11-update-breaks-file-explorer/" target="_blank">File Explorer crashes</a>. The times when your once-snappy PC build feels like it's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/10-things-that-are-slowing-down-your-pc-and-how-to-fix-them/" target="_blank">wading through swampy waters</a> muddied by temporary files and redundant Registry entries. Worse, these slowdowns are so gradual, they often fly under the radar, but the realization comes suddenly.</p>

Wrestling games were a big part of the 90s. But not all of them were champions, and most were total jobbers. Here are a few that weren't that great!
<p>Growing up in the 90s and early 2000s with video games included many different kinds of fandom. One of those fandoms that was closely tied to games was wrestling, especially with the WWF and WCW promotions that were big at the time. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-wrestling-video-games-everybody-replay" target="_blank">Multiple wrestling games were developed</a> and released throughout the 90s and 2000s, with a following that grew to support a variety of platforms as the popularity of wrestling continued to grow. But while there were classic wrestling games that people fondly remember, not all of them were champions in the eyes of fans. Some wrestling games were just flat out terrible, and viewed as jobbers to other games that were better overall.</p>

High resource usage was driving me insane, so I ditched it for something better.
<p>Over the past six months, I've transitioned almost every piece of software I use from a commercial platform to an open-source alternative. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-365-drawbacks/" target="_blank">Microsoft Office</a> was one of the first to go, with WPS Office taking its place. At first, it worked great. It replaced all the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-microsoft-word-is-better-than-google-docs/" target="_blank">functionality of MS Word</a> with a familiar interface and made switching between documents and spreadsheets as easy as clicking a button. And then things started to go downhill.</p>

The project wasn't a complete failure, I suppose
<p>Just like old PCs and laptops, there are plenty of ways to repurpose an old smartphone. If it has a functional camera, you could turn it into a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/turn-old-smartphone-into-webcam-for-pc/" target="_blank">makeshift webcam</a> for your PC, or even a full-on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-recycled-my-old-phone-by-turning-it-into-a-diy-dashcam/" target="_blank">surveillance system using a Frigate server</a>.

This OS felt like a fever dream.
<p>It's not all that often you get to play around with an operating system as unique as TempleOS. Developed by one man, Terry A. Davis, <a href="https://www.templeos.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TempleOS</a> is a 64-bit open-source operating system that, while on the surface, may seem simplistic and messy, is actually a very impressive amalgamation of one man's inspiration from god, combined with great programming prowess, and ultimately forever tied with tragedy. It's definitely the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/alternative-operating-systems-are-fun-but-theyre-not-for-the-average-user/" target="_blank">weirdest OS</a> I've ever tried on my PC, but I don't regret it in the slightest.</p>
