Console gamers should be prepared when switching to PC gaming
<p>If you've been a console gamer all your life, you would inevitably have some expectations from your primary gaming device. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/no-one-tells-you-this-about-switching-from-console-to-pc/" target="_blank">Moving to PC gaming</a>, however, can shatter a lot of those expectations, especially for gamers who aren't especially interested in getting into the details. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pc-gaming-better-than-console-gaming/" target="_blank">Gaming PCs are superior</a> in terms of customization, graphical capabilities, immersion, and upgradability, but they also demand significantly more from you.</p>

Discover the key Windows tools and features that are conspicuously absent in Ubuntu, making it challenging for users switching from Windows to adapt to the Linux-based OS.
<p>Windows 10's impending retirement has users in a state of uncertainty. The obvious alternatives are mainstream Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, that don't impose difficult system requirements like those of Windows 11. Unsurprisingly, users like me will switch to Ubuntu because of its popularity and open-source nature, which doesn't require a one-time purchase or subscription. However, using it as a daily driver on one of the laptops made me realize that it lacks several native features that I expect an operating system to have.</p>

Two major new IPs just landed, and both are fantastic. Here’s how they compare if you’re deciding which one to play first.
<p>Gamers love engaging in discourse about how sequels, remasters, and remakes have been filling up the market, and we don't get new IPs nearly as much as we should. And while I do love a well-made remake or sequel as much as the next guy, it's impossible not to be significantly more excited about new IPs and franchises. And that's why the first week of September 2025 felt so incredible, since we got not one, but two new IPs on the market — Rogue Factor's <em>Hell is Us</em>, and <em>Cronos: The New Dawn </em>by Bloober Team.</p>

Discover how Perfice, a free and easy-to-use self-hosted productivity tool, can help you track multiple goals and improve your workflow and focus.
<p>I have tried numerous productivity and planning tools over the years. They have great features and benefits, but I expect them to do better when it<span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1016368"><a href="/i-tried-dozens-of-personal-knowledge-management-apps-and-i-keep-coming-back-to-this-tool/" target="_blank">comes to personalization</a></span>. That's the first shortcoming I noticed in the popular choices. On a bigger scale, these commercial productivity tools have many other downsides. They collect data that might be used to exploit or make a profit from you. Many features are only available if you are willing to pay more, and the apps can sometimes be difficult to customize.</p>

Discover how Firecracker microVMs bring speed, isolation, and efficiency to self-hosted services in your home lab.
<p>When you think of self-hosting, chances are Docker containers, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-installed-proxmox-on-a-decade-old-laptop/" target="_blank">Proxmox installations</a>, or similar full virtual machines come to mind. Both approaches have their strengths, and most of us settle into one or the other depending on the workload. But after experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker" target="_blank">Firecracker microVMs</a>, I’ve found a new favorite option that feels like the best of both worlds.</p>

Discover the reasons behind switching from a curved OLED monitor back to a flat panel for daily use, gaming, and productivity.
<p>When I purchased the Alienware AW3423DW a couple of years ago, I was excited to try out an OLED monitor for the first time and curious to see what its 1800R curve would add to my experience. Until then, I had always used flat LCD panels, so the thought of combining OLED's visual upgrades with a curved screen felt like the upgrade I had been waiting for. But after using it as my primary monitor for some time, I bought a faster flat OLED, the <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1009242"><a href="/alienware-aw2725df-27-inch-qd-oled-review/" target="_blank">AW2725DF</a></span>, in 2024.</p>

Unbound DNS is a great recursive DNS resolver, and you can use it on any device no matter where you are.
<p>I recently got around to setting up <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1015312"><a href="/reasons-run-dns-server-unbound/" target="_blank">Unbound DNS in OPNsense</a></span>, after getting incredibly frustrated with Pi-hole. I had been running it in a Proxmox Linux container (LXC) for the longest time, after it had lived in a TrueNAS container for even longer. Once I migrated to Proxmox, Pi-hole was one of the first services I moved to an LXC and stopped using on TrueNAS, and it worked well... at first.</p>

Learn what this home lab enthusiast wishes they knew before diving in.
<p>I'm fully onboard with the recent push towards self-hosting services and apps, whether to <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1022630"><a href="/save-using-these-self-hosted-services-instead-paid-tools/" target="_blank">reduce subscription costs</a></span>, <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1022553"><a href="/these-self-hosted-apps-cater-to-my-data-hoarding-needs/" target="_blank">retain data sovereignty</a></span>, or pick up some new handy skills.

Some of these services came with additional setup <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-people-over-simplify-self-hosting/" target="_blank">that was mostly glossed over by the initial tutorials</a>, but that's far from the only thing that isn't apparent when you take those first few steps into self-hosting.</p>

Discover how free Obsidian plugins can streamline your workflow by replacing dedicated task, calendar, and time tracking apps, all within a single, customizable environment.
<p>Obsidian has become the app I use for just about everything these days, not because of the default features, but because of the free <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/obsidian-features-plugins-regret-not-using-earlier/" target="_blank">community plugins</a> that allow me to make the changes I want so it matches my workflow. Most people juggle separate apps for tasks, boards, notes, and calendars, but I’ve managed to cut that stack in half by keeping it all inside Obsidian.</p>
