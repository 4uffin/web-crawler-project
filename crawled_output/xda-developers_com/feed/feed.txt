You don't need a new router yet.
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/wifi-numbers-are-functionally-useless/" target="_blank">Wi-Fi is an ever-changing beast</a>, and whatever is available right now will be supplanted by a new version in the coming months. This is how it's always been, and while the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/signs-time-replace-your-wi-fi-router/" target="_blank">latest Wi-Fi routers</a> are better than ever, do you really need them? I realize there's an aspect of hubris in that question because I've got <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-is-wi-fi-7" target="_blank">Wi-Fi 7</a> access points, routers, and mesh nodes in my home, but it's my job to test these things, so I know what I'm talking about.</p>

Not all of them made it to the end conscious.
<p>So I've been having fun mixing AI with D&D. I had AI make a dungeon for me to explore, and then got a few models to make me legendary D&D magic items, and the encounter players need to defeat to get them.</p>

Most users don't need to buy more than 8 cores
<p>When I say "high-end CPUs", I mean any CPU with more than 8 cores. These processors are undoubtedly made for particularly demanding workloads, and have their place on the market. That said, the relevance of high-end chips has gone down with time, especially for those only interested in gaming, occasional productivity, or even AI/ML workloads. Due to the advances in computational power, challenges with scaling, and more emphasis on the GPU, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-reasons-im-not-buying-a-high-end-cpu-for-high-end-gaming-anymore/" target="_blank">high-end CPUs just aren't as necessary anymore</a>.</p>

Discover 4 hidden features of Google's NotebookLM that can transform your productivity. From curating sources to interactive audio overviews, these power user secrets will help you get the most out of this AI tool.
<p>AI has taken over several cumbersome online experiences, ranging from workplace companions that automate email responses to agentic AI tools handling hotel bookings for a vacation. However, NotebookLM is the quiet underdog that excels at any task I've thrown at it. Google designed it around the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/finally-started-using-notebooklm-and-should-have-sooner/" target="_blank">premise of simplicity and power</a>, devoid of the typical LLM limitations like hallucinated data and unverified sources in every corner of the internet. NotebookLM <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/productivity-tools-i-pair-with-notebooklm/" target="_blank">only works with what I supply</a>, and its multimodal nature makes it indispensable for wolfing down user manuals or learning new skills like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-how-to-brew-coffee-taste-test/" target="_blank">brewing coffee</a>.</p>

Everything will become Xbox.
<p>While Sony and Nintendo continue the console wars, Microsoft's mission has changed. Once a big fan of exclusive titles, the company has shifted gears and wants to bring its games and libraries to as many devices as humanly possible, even its competitors'. The best bit? <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-playstation-6-of-10/" target="_blank">It seems to be working</a>.</p>

It seems really useful.
<p>If you're a Microsoft 365 fan, you either love Copilot or you hate it. Unfortunately for the latter camp, Microsoft would really, really prefer that you did love it. In fact, it wants you to use its AI assistant so badly that it's introducing a new feature that gives you the power of Copilot at your fingertips at no extra cost. However, if you are a subscriber to Copilot, don't fret; there's still something here for you.</p>

Discover RustNet, a cross-platform network monitoring tool that turns your terminal into a live dashboard for tracking incoming and outgoing connections, bandwidth usage, and more.
<p>If you, like me, find yourself experimenting with apps and services all the time, keeping a tab on what's going on behind the scenes on your home network is important. I've previously dabbled with system utilities like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-these-open-source-resource-management-tools-monitor-windows-11-resources/" target="_blank">Activity Monitor</a> and netstat to take a peek behind the scenes, but I've been on the lookout for a utility that offers more than just a pretty interface. And that's basically how I discovered RustNet — a cross-platform network monitoring tool built with Rust. <a href="https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">RustNet</a> takes an interesting approach by turning your terminal into a live <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/productivity-dashboards-for-browser/" target="_blank">dashboard</a> where you can watch incoming and outgoing connections, see which apps are talking to which services online, and even filter or inspect traffic based on your needs. It's a simple and straightforward way to get a clear view of traffic spikes and background activity that you might not have noticed otherwise. So, if you care about security, performance, or just want to understand your machine's network activity better, I'd highly recommend looking into RustNet as it can potentially turn your good-old command line into a full-fledged network control center.</p>
