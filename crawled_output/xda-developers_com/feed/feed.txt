<![CDATA[This HASS.Agent alternative is the best data reporting application for Home Assistant users on Linux]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/hass-agent-alternative-best-data-reporting-home-assistant-linux/Adam ConwaySoftware and ServicesHome Assistant
If you're a Linux user, you won't need to use IoPC anymore for Home Assistant.
<p>Home Assistant is a powerful way to connect all of your devices, self-hosted services, and build automations between all of them. However, connecting your computer on an operating system level can be a confusing endeavor. <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1020462"><a href="/hass-agent-windows-must-have-home-assistant-users/" target="_blank">HASS.Agent</a></span> is the best way to do that on Windows, but a recent Windows Defender update has seen the most recent stable version of the application become unusable thanks to the <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1022955"><a href="/windows-11-driver-signature-requirement-best-anti-consumer-security/" target="_blank">expiration of the certificate that the WinRing0 driver uses</a></span>. For Linux users who could never use HASS.Agent, though, there's a great alternative that's even better than HASS.Agent, and it's called Go HASS Agent.</p>

The Steam Frame may be near.
<p>If you've been keeping up with gaming hardware news, you'll know that Valve has been working on a project called the "Steam Frame." We don't know a great deal about the project, only that Valve is working hard at it right now. Well, I don't mean to alarm anyone, but several popular hardware YouTubers have suddenly, collectively decided to either take a trip over to Seattle (where Valve's HQ is) or take some time off for tomorrow specifically. It could just be nothing, or it could be absolutely everything.</p>

These are most common case fan configuration mistakes PC builders make, and how to fix them to improve overall system temperatures
<p>Case airflow is one of the most overlooked parts of a PC build, and depending on which parts you have in your rig, it can make a pretty <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/simple-upgrades-drastically-improve-pc-cooling/" target="_blank">huge difference</a>. While modern cases come with fans installed in their intended direction, over the course of your build you will inevitably have to consider case airflow, and these four mistakes are some of the most common when it comes to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pc-airflow-guide/" target="_blank">fan configuration</a>.</p>

Some game franchises are closely linked to specific platforms. Here are 4 franchises that often get played on PlayStation over Xbox consoles.
<p>There was a time when <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-that-get-me-to-replay-games-on-every-platform-i-own" target="_blank">people grew up with video games</a> that mostly appeared on one specific platform. Because of this, franchises that became popular were often closely linked to the consoles that people were able to play them on. Although this wasn't always due to exclusivity deals for game series, the majority of players would still gravitate towards one console over the other for specific titles they enjoyed. And over time, that preference followed them into the modern era, even with most games being available across multiple platforms and offering the same experience to everyone.</p>

RAM may seem inconsequential when looking for a NAS, but you shouldn't skimp out on it
<p>When I’m out buying a NAS or checking out the components for a custom storage server, there are a couple of factors I take into consideration. The number of drive bays lies at the top of the priority list, and I often run some internal calculations about the storage capacity before locking in on a NAS. Likewise, the RAM is something I never skimp out on – even on the more affordable builds. In fact, it’s something I pay a lot of attention to when hunting for pre-built NAS units or putting together one myself.</p>

Your outdated laptop can double as a rock-solid PVE workstation
<p>As someone who grew up drooling over server PCs, I got quite a whiplash after realizing that you don’t need enterprise-grade hardware for computing projects. Sure, bulky systems with tons of RAM and CPU cores can handle virtualization-heavy workloads. But if you’ve got old systems lying around, you can repurpose them into reliable self-hosting and experimentation rigs.</p>

Raycast is finally coming to Windows, and it's improving some of my favorite features built into the operating system.

An AI writing partner that keeps me on track
<p>I write a lot: articles, novel drafts, research notes. The struggle isn’t always the writing itself, it’s managing everything around it. I have so much scattered research and half-written drafts that always end up buried somewhere. I’ve also <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-dozens-note-taking-apps-keep-coming-back-tool/" target="_blank">tried dozens of notes apps</a> and AI tools, but many of them overwhelm me with features or give me generic results.</p>
