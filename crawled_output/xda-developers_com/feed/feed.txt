<![CDATA[The Raycast beta for Windows already improves one of my favorite features]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/raycast-beta-windows-improves-favorite-feature/João CarrasqueiraWindowsMicrosoftWindows 11Raycast
Raycast is finally coming to Windows, and it's improving some of my favorite features built into the operating system.
<p>If you read my recent piece on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/moved-away-from-windows-11-but-didnt-go-to-linux/" target="_blank">switching from Windows to Mac</a>, you might know that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/raycast-productivity-superpower-mac-users/" target="_blank">Raycast is one of my absolute favorite pieces of software</a> ever. I absolutely love everything it offers, and when I heard it was coming to Windows, needless to say, I was ecstatic. The beta opened up recently, and I finally got an invite to try it for myself.</p>

An AI writing partner that keeps me on track
<p>I write a lot: articles, novel drafts, research notes. The struggle isn’t always the writing itself, it’s managing everything around it. I have so much scattered research and half-written drafts that always end up buried somewhere. I’ve also <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-dozens-note-taking-apps-keep-coming-back-tool/" target="_blank">tried dozens of notes apps</a> and AI tools, but many of them overwhelm me with features or give me generic results.</p>

NotebookLM’s apparently a coding sidekick I didn’t know I needed.
<p>I'm currently majoring in computer science, and most of my daily classes revolve around coding. And while I’ve always been passionate about my major and genuinely enjoy coding, I’d be lying if I said it’s easy. It can get overwhelming at times, and learning (let alone retaining) everything taught in class isn’t always straightforward.</p>

And it even steals a page from macOS.
<p>Whether it's a research assistant like NotebookLM, a new foldable, or a handy Gmail feature, Google is always working on something or another. But one thing we don't see the tech giant do often is drop a dedicated Windows app.</p>

Discover which gaming accessories can harm your consoles and learn why it's best to avoid them, even if they seem convenient or affordable.
<p>Having extra accessories for a video game console can be pretty helpful. While most first-party accessories can enhance the experience of playing games, they can also make some aspects of gaming easier and more comfortable. However, there are also accessories on the market that don't do things better, but can rather be harmful to your system. And if you're not careful, the wrong accessory can do irreparable damage to a very expensive video game console. That's a problem nobody wants to find themselves dealing with.</p>

Old habits die hard.
<p>If you've used a Windows PC, you might have noticed that the main system drive is labeled "C:" by default and caught yourself wondering what happened to "A:" or "B:". After all, the alphabet doesn't start with "C," so what's going on there? This naming quirk actually has a reason for existing, and it dates back to the early days of personal computing. Like a lot of things, it's rooted in historical conventions and legacy hardware.</p>

The next big Windows 11 update is coming. But it's not actually big aside from extending your support period.
<p>It's almost that time again — since the initial launch in 2021, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11/" target="_blank">Windows 11</a> has received annual feature updates in the second half of each year, and 2025 is no different in that regard. What is a bit different this time around is the number of interesting things to talk about in this update. That's because there really aren't any.</p>

Free design tools seemed limited until I tried this one
<p>I’ve rotated through so many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-design-tools-non-designers-beyond-canva/" target="_blank">free design tools</a> at this point that they’re all starting to blend together. Many of them try to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-dozens-of-photoshop-alternatives-keep-coming-back-to-this-free-tool/" target="_blank">the free Photoshop</a> or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/regret-not-ditching-adobe-for-open-source-design-app/" target="_blank">the open-source Figma</a>, but when I sit down to actually work, the shine wears off fast. Either it lacks advanced features or still locks some important tools behind a paywall. That’s pretty much my cycle: download, test, get frustrated, move onto the next.</p>

The surprising power of a 17MB Linux distribution
<p>Tiny Core Linux is a distribution that doesn’t try to compete with the giants. Instead, it carves out a unique niche by being incredibly small, incredibly fast, and surprisingly capable for its size. At just 16MB, it’s a fraction of the size of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/perfect-secondary-linux-os-ubuntu-cinnamon/" target="_blank">most Linux distros</a>, yet it still provides a working desktop environment. That alone makes it an intriguing project, but what really stands out is how it challenges the assumption that modern systems need to be large and complex.</p>

Discover the lesser-known advantages of enabling XMP or EXPO profiles for your RAM, including improved system responsiveness, manufacturer-tested stability, and smoother frame pacing in games.
<p>When we think about <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/whats-the-difference-between-expo-and-xmp/" target="_blank">XMP or EXPO profiles</a>, the first thing that usually comes to mind is faster RAM speeds. After all, that's the main selling point and the easiest metric to measure. When I first got into PC gaming, I used to focus solely on speeds, but soon enough, I learned that these profiles do a lot more than make your RAM run at higher frequencies. They actually brought practical improvements that made my PC more stable, efficient, and enjoyable, not just for gaming but for day-to-day tasks as well.</p>
