<![CDATA[4 times when an M.2 heatsink is more than just cosmetic]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/4-times-when-an-m2-heatsink-is-more-than-just-cosmetic/Ty SherbackStorageSSD
There does come a time when these heatsinks aren't only for looks
<p>SSD speeds have continued to skyrocket with PCIe Gen 4 and Gen 5, and with it, so have their thermal demands. M.2 drives may be tiny, but they can run surprisingly hot under load, especially in compact cases or poorly ventilated spots on your motherboard. Without a heatsink, many of these drives will <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/5-reasons-why-your-ssd-isnt-as-fast-as-it-could-be/" target="_blank">throttle down</a>, lose consistency, or even wear out <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/your-ssd-is-fine-probably-these-are-the-4-smart-attributes-you-should-actually-care-about/" target="_blank">faster than expected</a>. That’s when an M.2 drive heatsink goes from an optional add-on to something that can make a big difference.</p>

NBA 2K MyCareer modes aren't known for their award-winning narratives, but these campaigns broke the mold.
<p>When you think about sports games, especially annualized ones, the "story mode" isn't usually the first thing that comes to mind. Not for the players, and definitely not for the devs. And that's okay, because it's par for the course. Most players dive straight into online, franchise, or career-building, and that's where they spend their time. </p>

Network segmentation can be done in multiple ways
<p>As your home network needs grow, you might <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1023143"><a href="/how-vlans-separate-smart-home-devices-why-you-should/" target="_blank">consider network segmentation</a></span> to make it more manageable and keep things safer. If you are, you're on the right track toward having a <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1015756"><a href="/make-your-home-network-more-resilient-to-outages/" target="_blank">more resililiant network</a></span>, where ease of use is balanced with security and other needs. The most common way to achieve this is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rules-for-sane-vlan-design-at-home/" target="_blank">through using VLANs</a>, but that isn't the only way to get the network segmentation you want, and it might not be the best way for your particular network setup.</p>

You're using Reddit wrong if you aren't pairing it with NotebookLM.
<p>Outside quick questions, I often don't turn to Google or even AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini when I need real answers. More often than not, I end up on Reddit. Now, here's the issue with Reddit: it's extremely easy to get sidetracked and fall into a rabbit hole of endless threads. Before you know it, you've spent hours and hours scrolling through random Reddit posts, even when the original question that brought you there was solved long, long ago.</p>

Say goodbye to underpowered SBCs and noisy desktops. There's a new contender in town for your Jellyfin server.
<p>If you’ve been looking for a reliable and affordable way to host your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-plugin-to-watch-youtube-on-jellyfin/" target="_blank">Jellyfin media server</a>, chances are you’ve considered using a Raspberry Pi or repurposing an old desktop. Both options are popular, but neither is a perfect fit. The Pi often struggles with transcoding and multiple streams, while a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/turn-old-windows-pc-streaming-server-jellyfin/" target="_blank">power-hungry tower PC</a> is noisy and inefficient. That leaves many people stuck trying to balance performance, cost, and convenience.</p>

Things have gotten too comfortable for me to return to Microsoft.
<p>People migrate from Windows to Linux for a multitude of different reasons; for me, it was to give my aging PC a second lease on life after the Windows 10 end-of-life date arrives. Yes, I could force an upgrade to Windows 11. Yes, I could extend my Windows 10 security license another year. But I'm not a fan of Windows 11, and I don't want to be stuck on an operating system that won't receive any new content updates ever again.</p>

If you can't live without Windows apps on Linux, WinBoat could be a great solution. But it's got a few problems that need to be worked out.
<p>There seems to be an increasing desire from many people to ditch <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11/" target="_blank">Windows 11</a> in favor of Linux, and I've been caught up in it. I've tried a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/used-windows-all-life-so-dove-deep-end-tried-arch-linux/" target="_blank">few Linux distros</a> over the past few months, and I've settled on Arch Linux with KDE Plasma for what I now consider my main laptop.</p>

That’s why I swapped cloud rent for a NAS
<p>Even after I moved all my data to my brand-new NAS, I knew that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-went-hybrid-with-nas/" target="_blank">cloud storage would continue to hold importance in my storage setup</a>. The convenience of the cloud remains unmatched, allowing you to access your files from almost anywhere. However, there are still so many areas where a network storage server wipes the floor with cloud storage services like Dropbox. When you have a lot of things to manage, the tools you’re using become quite central to your system, and that’s when having a central server makes sense. Here are seven such moments that made it clear.</p>

Discover how undervolting your GPU can lead to better performance, lower temperatures, and reduced noise levels, all while maintaining stability
<p>When we consider performance-enhancing techniques outside buying brand-new hardware, most people probably think of things like improving cooling, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-change-these-two-simple-settings-on-my-gpu-to-unlock-better-performance/" target="_blank">increasing the power limit</a> or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/cpu-overclocking-is-mostly-dead/" target="_blank">overclocking</a>. While these are absolutely valid ways to squeeze more performance out of a component like your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/7-insane-graphics-cards-you-forgot-existed/" target="_blank">graphics card</a>, there's another, perhaps counterintuative, way to do that, and that's through undervolting.</p>
