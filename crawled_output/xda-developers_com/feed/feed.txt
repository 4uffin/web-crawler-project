<![CDATA[I tried dozens of Pocket alternatives, and I keep coming back to this self-hosted tool]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/wallabag-is-the-best-self-hosted-pocket-alternative/Yash PatelSoftware and ServicesSelf-Hostingsoftware
The quest for the perfect read-it-later app ends here
<p>After relying on Pocket for years, I found myself in a familiar dilemma when it announced its shutdown: finding a new home for my endless "to-read" list. I tried dozens of alternatives, from big-name apps to smaller services, but nothing felt right. They were all either too messy, too confusing, or they just didn't have the features I needed. It seemed impossible to find a service that truly felt like my own.</p>

Discover how LatencyMon, a real-time audio processing tool, can help diagnose and fix underlying issues causing your PC to slow down and stutter.
<p>I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of my life chasing down the ghosts in my machines. You know, the intermittent stutter, dropped frames, and the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11-update-breaks-file-explorer/" target="_blank">File Explorer crashes</a>. The times when your once-snappy PC build feels like it's <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/10-things-that-are-slowing-down-your-pc-and-how-to-fix-them/" target="_blank">wading through swampy waters</a> muddied by temporary files and redundant Registry entries. Worse, these slowdowns are so gradual, they often fly under the radar, but the realization comes suddenly.</p>

Wrestling games were a big part of the 90s. But not all of them were champions, and most were total jobbers. Here are a few that weren't that great!
<p>Growing up in the 90s and early 2000s with video games included many different kinds of fandom. One of those fandoms that was closely tied to games was wrestling, especially with the WWF and WCW promotions that were big at the time. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-wrestling-video-games-everybody-replay" target="_blank">Multiple wrestling games were developed</a> and released throughout the 90s and 2000s, with a following that grew to support a variety of platforms as the popularity of wrestling continued to grow. But while there were classic wrestling games that people fondly remember, not all of them were champions in the eyes of fans. Some wrestling games were just flat out terrible, and viewed as jobbers to other games that were better overall.</p>

High resource usage was driving me insane, so I ditched it for something better.
<p>Over the past six months, I've transitioned almost every piece of software I use from a commercial platform to an open-source alternative. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-365-drawbacks/" target="_blank">Microsoft Office</a> was one of the first to go, with WPS Office taking its place. At first, it worked great. It replaced all the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-microsoft-word-is-better-than-google-docs/" target="_blank">functionality of MS Word</a> with a familiar interface and made switching between documents and spreadsheets as easy as clicking a button. And then things started to go downhill.</p>

The project wasn't a complete failure, I suppose
<p>Just like old PCs and laptops, there are plenty of ways to repurpose an old smartphone. If it has a functional camera, you could turn it into a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/turn-old-smartphone-into-webcam-for-pc/" target="_blank">makeshift webcam</a> for your PC, or even a full-on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-recycled-my-old-phone-by-turning-it-into-a-diy-dashcam/" target="_blank">surveillance system using a Frigate server</a>. Alternatively, you could use its touchscreen display to build a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/turned-old-phone-home-assistant-dashboard-desk/" target="_blank">reliable Home Assistant dashboard</a>.

This OS felt like a fever dream.
<p>It's not all that often you get to play around with an operating system as unique as TempleOS. Developed by one man, Terry A. Davis, <a href="https://www.templeos.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TempleOS</a> is a 64-bit open-source operating system that, while on the surface, may seem simplistic and messy, is actually a very impressive amalgamation of one man's inspiration from god, combined with great programming prowess, and ultimately forever tied with tragedy. It's definitely the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/alternative-operating-systems-are-fun-but-theyre-not-for-the-average-user/" target="_blank">weirdest OS</a> I've ever tried on my PC, but I don't regret it in the slightest.</p>

Before you start getting that storage drive ready for recycling, do a quick sanity check on these parameters.
<p>Modern storage drives have a feature called <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/smart-attributes-that-predict-drive-failure/" target="_blank">SMART data</a>, which stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology. This feature is intended to monitor the health of your data drive and provide an early warning if your SSD or HDD is suffering from problems or has reached the end of its useful life cycle.</p>

It's a neat utility for folks with old home servers and plenty of blackouts
<p>When you think about home labs, you’ll probably imagine powerful, multi-CPU setups with ungodly amounts of memory. Although enterprise-grade systems are terrific for computing projects, old systems can also double as solid workstations for your DIY ideas and self-hosting projects once you pair them with the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/operating-systems-for-reviving-your-old-pc-as-a-server/" target="_blank">right operating systems</a>.</p>

Fans of Star Wars have wanted to explore different eras in games. Rather than The High Republic, new games can take place in these eras instead!
<p>The release of new <em>Star Wars</em> video games is always an exciting time for fans of the franchise. Not only do we get new stories to follow, but we get to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-star-wars-planets-ive-visited-video-games" target="_blank">see other parts from a galaxy far, far away</a> in different time periods that help build out a continuously expanding universe. However, a lot of time and energy from Lucasfilm was devoted to exploring the new High Republic era, which wasn't received as well as they hoped. Some games like <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em> injected aspects of The High Republic into their narrative, but it was met with a shallow reception. Despite this, it hasn't turned <em>Star Wars</em> fans away from the idea of new video game releases exploring different time periods.</p>

The game-changing tools that make MX Linux a standout choice for efficiency and customization among hundreds of Linux distros.
<p>MX Linux is one of the more distinct-looking Linux distributions that tries to make the overall operating system experience less cumbersome for the average user. If you've tinkered with Linux-based distros in the past or use one now, you probably leverage the terminal for even basic setting changes and tweaks. But it's not 2010 anymore, and simple GUI options for routine and necessary operating system actions should be more mainstream. After switching to MX Linux, I discovered many useful tools that make the OS settings and customization remarkably easy.</p>
