<![CDATA[I avoid buying these gaming accessories to protect my consoles, and you should do the same]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/i-avoid-buying-these-gaming-accessories-to-protect-consoles/Jakejames LugoGamingNintendoNintendo Switch 2PlayStation 5
Discover which gaming accessories can harm your consoles and learn why it's best to avoid them, even if they seem convenient or affordable.
<p>Having extra accessories for a video game console can be pretty helpful. While most first-party accessories can enhance the experience of playing games, they can also make some aspects of gaming easier and more comfortable. However, there are also accessories on the market that don't do things better, but can rather be harmful to your system. And if you're not careful, the wrong accessory can do irreparable damage to a very expensive video game console. That's a problem nobody wants to find themselves dealing with.</p>

Old habits die hard.
<p>If you've used a Windows PC, you might have noticed that the main system drive is labeled "C:" by default and caught yourself wondering what happened to "A:" or "B:". After all, the alphabet doesn't start with "C," so what's going on there? This naming quirk actually has a reason for existing, and it dates back to the early days of personal computing. Like a lot of things, it's rooted in historical conventions and legacy hardware.</p>

The next big Windows 11 update is coming. But it's not actually big aside from extending your support period.
<p>It's almost that time again — since the initial launch in 2021, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11/" target="_blank">Windows 11</a> has received annual feature updates in the second half of each year, and 2025 is no different in that regard. What is a bit different this time around is the number of interesting things to talk about in this update. That's because there really aren't any.</p>

Free design tools seemed limited until I tried this one
<p>I’ve rotated through so many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-design-tools-non-designers-beyond-canva/" target="_blank">free design tools</a> at this point that they’re all starting to blend together. Many of them try to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-dozens-of-photoshop-alternatives-keep-coming-back-to-this-free-tool/" target="_blank">the free Photoshop</a> or <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/regret-not-ditching-adobe-for-open-source-design-app/" target="_blank">the open-source Figma</a>, but when I sit down to actually work, the shine wears off fast. Either it lacks advanced features or still locks some important tools behind a paywall. That’s pretty much my cycle: download, test, get frustrated, move onto the next.</p>

The surprising power of a 17MB Linux distribution
<p>Tiny Core Linux is a distribution that doesn’t try to compete with the giants. Instead, it carves out a unique niche by being incredibly small, incredibly fast, and surprisingly capable for its size. At just 16MB, it’s a fraction of the size of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/perfect-secondary-linux-os-ubuntu-cinnamon/" target="_blank">most Linux distros</a>, yet it still provides a working desktop environment. That alone makes it an intriguing project, but what really stands out is how it challenges the assumption that modern systems need to be large and complex.</p>

Discover the lesser-known advantages of enabling XMP or EXPO profiles for your RAM, including improved system responsiveness, manufacturer-tested stability, and smoother frame pacing in games.
<p>When we think about <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/whats-the-difference-between-expo-and-xmp/" target="_blank">XMP or EXPO profiles</a>, the first thing that usually comes to mind is faster RAM speeds. After all, that's the main selling point and the easiest metric to measure. When I first got into PC gaming, I used to focus solely on speeds, but soon enough, I learned that these profiles do a lot more than make your RAM run at higher frequencies. They actually brought practical improvements that made my PC more stable, efficient, and enjoyable, not just for gaming but for day-to-day tasks as well.</p>

You don't need a new router yet.
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/wifi-numbers-are-functionally-useless/" target="_blank">Wi-Fi is an ever-changing beast</a>, and whatever is available right now will be supplanted by a new version in the coming months. This is how it's always been, and while the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/signs-time-replace-your-wi-fi-router/" target="_blank">latest Wi-Fi routers</a> are better than ever, do you really need them? I realize there's an aspect of hubris in that question because I've got <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-is-wi-fi-7" target="_blank">Wi-Fi 7</a> access points, routers, and mesh nodes in my home, but it's my job to test these things, so I know what I'm talking about.</p>

Not all of them made it to the end conscious.
<p>So I've been having fun mixing AI with D&D. I had AI make a dungeon for me to explore, and then got a few models to make me legendary D&D magic items, and the encounter players need to defeat to get them.</p>

Most users don't need to buy more than 8 cores
<p>When I say "high-end CPUs", I mean any CPU with more than 8 cores. These processors are undoubtedly made for particularly demanding workloads, and have their place on the market. That said, the relevance of high-end chips has gone down with time, especially for those only interested in gaming, occasional productivity, or even AI/ML workloads. Due to the advances in computational power, challenges with scaling, and more emphasis on the GPU, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-reasons-im-not-buying-a-high-end-cpu-for-high-end-gaming-anymore/" target="_blank">high-end CPUs just aren't as necessary anymore</a>.</p>
