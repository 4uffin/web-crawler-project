<![CDATA[This 17MB Linux distro runs on just about any PC]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/17mb-linux-distro-runs-any-pc/Jeff ButtsLinuxHome LabLinux Distro
The surprising power of a 17MB Linux distribution
<p>Tiny Core Linux is a distribution that doesn’t try to compete with the giants. Instead, it carves out a unique niche by being incredibly small, incredibly fast, and surprisingly capable for its size. At just 16MB, it’s a fraction of the size of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/perfect-secondary-linux-os-ubuntu-cinnamon/" target="_blank">most Linux distros</a>, yet it still provides a working desktop environment. That alone makes it an intriguing project, but what really stands out is how it challenges the assumption that modern systems need to be large and complex.</p>

Discover the lesser-known advantages of enabling XMP or EXPO profiles for your RAM, including improved system responsiveness, manufacturer-tested stability, and smoother frame pacing in games.
<p>When we think about <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/whats-the-difference-between-expo-and-xmp/" target="_blank">XMP or EXPO profiles</a>, the first thing that usually comes to mind is faster RAM speeds. After all, that's the main selling point and the easiest metric to measure. When I first got into PC gaming, I used to focus solely on speeds, but soon enough, I learned that these profiles do a lot more than make your RAM run at higher frequencies. They actually brought practical improvements that made my PC more stable, efficient, and enjoyable, not just for gaming but for day-to-day tasks as well.</p>

You don't need a new router yet.
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/wifi-numbers-are-functionally-useless/" target="_blank">Wi-Fi is an ever-changing beast</a>, and whatever is available right now will be supplanted by a new version in the coming months. This is how it's always been, and while the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/signs-time-replace-your-wi-fi-router/" target="_blank">latest Wi-Fi routers</a> are better than ever, do you really need them? I realize there's an aspect of hubris in that question because I've got <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/what-is-wi-fi-7" target="_blank">Wi-Fi 7</a> access points, routers, and mesh nodes in my home, but it's my job to test these things, so I know what I'm talking about.</p>

Not all of them made it to the end conscious.
<p>So I've been having fun mixing AI with D&D. I had AI make a dungeon for me to explore, and then got a few models to make me legendary D&D magic items, and the encounter players need to defeat to get them.</p>

Most users don't need to buy more than 8 cores
<p>When I say "high-end CPUs", I mean any CPU with more than 8 cores. These processors are undoubtedly made for particularly demanding workloads, and have their place on the market. That said, the relevance of high-end chips has gone down with time, especially for those only interested in gaming, occasional productivity, or even AI/ML workloads. Due to the advances in computational power, challenges with scaling, and more emphasis on the GPU, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/4-reasons-im-not-buying-a-high-end-cpu-for-high-end-gaming-anymore/" target="_blank">high-end CPUs just aren't as necessary anymore</a>.</p>

Discover 4 hidden features of Google's NotebookLM that can transform your productivity. From curating sources to interactive audio overviews, these power user secrets will help you get the most out of this AI tool.
<p>AI has taken over several cumbersome online experiences, ranging from workplace companions that automate email responses to agentic AI tools handling hotel bookings for a vacation. However, NotebookLM is the quiet underdog that excels at any task I've thrown at it. Google designed it around the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/finally-started-using-notebooklm-and-should-have-sooner/" target="_blank">premise of simplicity and power</a>, devoid of the typical LLM limitations like hallucinated data and unverified sources in every corner of the internet. NotebookLM <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/productivity-tools-i-pair-with-notebooklm/" target="_blank">only works with what I supply</a>, and its multimodal nature makes it indispensable for wolfing down user manuals or learning new skills like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-how-to-brew-coffee-taste-test/" target="_blank">brewing coffee</a>.</p>

Everything will become Xbox.
<p>While Sony and Nintendo continue the console wars, Microsoft's mission has changed. Once a big fan of exclusive titles, the company has shifted gears and wants to bring its games and libraries to as many devices as humanly possible, even its competitors'. The best bit? <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-playstation-6-of-10/" target="_blank">It seems to be working</a>.</p>

It seems really useful.
<p>If you're a Microsoft 365 fan, you either love Copilot or you hate it. Unfortunately for the latter camp, Microsoft would really, really prefer that you did love it. In fact, it wants you to use its AI assistant so badly that it's introducing a new feature that gives you the power of Copilot at your fingertips at no extra cost. However, if you are a subscriber to Copilot, don't fret; there's still something here for you.</p>
