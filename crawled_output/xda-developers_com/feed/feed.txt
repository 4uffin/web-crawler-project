The top 4 PC components that are worth buying used to save money on your next build, including cases, GPUs, storage, and RAM.
<p>There are few better feelings than cracking open fresh boxes of PC hardware. Remove the peel from your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-pick-pc-case/" target="_blank">case</a> side panel, unearth your shiny <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-lower-graphics-settings-than-upgrade-gpu/" target="_blank">new GPU</a> from its soft-shell foam packaging, and enjoy that new-RAM smell. There's nothing wrong with buying brand-new parts, and I enjoy that experience as much as the next PC enthusiast, but buying used hardware to save a buck will always be more alluring. I always look for these 4 components on the used market before I even think about buying new.</p>

Some games want you to fail, just so you can remember how to think for yourself and explore their worlds, and that's why they become unforgettable.
<p>We've all played hundreds, if not thousands of games that have told us where to go, what's going on, and how to go about the whole thing. However, there's just nothing like it when you boot up a game, and it looks you in the eye, shrugs, and says, "figure it out."</p>

Discover why I switched from Pi-hole to Unbound DNS for better DNS performance, reliability, and seamless integration with OPNsense routers.
<p>I've been <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/self-hosted-services-now-love/" target="_blank">self-hosting for a very long time</a>, whether it was an IRC bouncer to keep my nickname online and authenticated, a media server to watch movies, listen to music, and read manga from, and more recently, everything from smart home control to replacements for cloud services. I've also long been a user of DNS-based adblocking software, because I've been infected with malware from dodgy ad networks before, and I don't recommend it happening again.</p>

Trying to declutter your browser? Here are the three core extensions I use.
<p>Have you ever opened your list of browser extensions and realized you have way more installed than you realized? You might not even remember installing some of them, or know which ones are worth keeping or deleting. I’ve been there, and I narrowed down my list to just three essential extensions.</p>

Discover why overclocking a high-end GPU like the RTX 4090 can lead to more problems than benefits, from higher temperatures and louder fans to increased power draw and stability issues.
<p>It's hard to resist the temptation to squeeze out every last bit of performance from a graphics card, especially when you've splurged well over a grand on a high-end model. After all, why leave free performance on the table when your GPU is capable of more with just a couple of quick tweaks? That was exactly the mindset I had when I decided to overclock my RTX 4090. Like I expected, my average frame rates went up across all the games I tested, but the downsides quickly made me realize it wasn't worth it.</p>

Windows Group Policies are intended for IT fleet management, but a few simple tweaks can streamline your Windows 11 install perfectly
<p>Windows 11 is a very popular operating system, but it is also quite bloated. Microsoft has loaded Windows 11 with a number of features that are useful to some but an absolute pain to most people. Things like Microsoft Defender antivirus being hard to disable (permanently, that is), getting toast notifications for every single application, or dealing with OneDrive's backup policy can take Windows 11 from being a great operating system to a complete and utter disaster.</p>

Causes and risks of transient power spikes for your PC, and how to protect your hardware from potential damage.
<p>When planning out a <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1023356"><a href="/4-ways-pc-builders-mess-up-their-case-fan-configuration/" target="_blank">PC build</a></span> or considering your next component upgrade, power draw is usually at the top of mind, ensuring your PC will have enough power to properly run all the hardware. Not having a powerful enough power supply can result in system crashes and even potential damage to components if you're not careful. It's fairly easy to work out just how much rated capacity will be required for your system build, but it's important not to tunnel vision too much on power draw and overlook other power-related factors.</p>

My shortcut to getting unstuck
<p>Procrastination looks different for everyone, but for me, it’s about the friction points that make it feel impossible to get started or keep momentum. Something as simple as fact-checking can have me lost in a browser tab spiral, avoiding the original task.

A zombie shooter from 1999 just helped my partner boost her typing speed by 20% in a week. Here’s how.
<p>There's nothing louder in my apartment than my mechanical keyboard, except, well, myself, when I lose a ranked <em>Fortnite </em>match at 3 AM. Still, that keyboard is that clackety-clack soundtrack of my entire day, and on days when my partner stays home, it ends up being one of her biggest pain points about being around me. So, I simply switched it up for a cute low-profile board... only for her to love it so much that she stole it for herself. </p>
