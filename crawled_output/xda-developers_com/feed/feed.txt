Everything will become Xbox.
<p>While Sony and Nintendo continue the console wars, Microsoft's mission has changed. Once a big fan of exclusive titles, the company has shifted gears and wants to bring its games and libraries to as many devices as humanly possible, even its competitors'. The best bit? <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-playstation-6-of-10/" target="_blank">It seems to be working</a>.</p>

It seems really useful.
<p>If you're a Microsoft 365 fan, you either love Copilot or you hate it. Unfortunately for the latter camp, Microsoft would really, really prefer that you did love it. In fact, it wants you to use its AI assistant so badly that it's introducing a new feature that gives you the power of Copilot at your fingertips at no extra cost. However, if you are a subscriber to Copilot, don't fret; there's still something here for you.</p>

Discover RustNet, a cross-platform network monitoring tool that turns your terminal into a live dashboard for tracking incoming and outgoing connections, bandwidth usage, and more.
<p>If you, like me, find yourself experimenting with apps and services all the time, keeping a tab on what's going on behind the scenes on your home network is important. I've previously dabbled with system utilities like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/using-these-open-source-resource-management-tools-monitor-windows-11-resources/" target="_blank">Activity Monitor</a> and netstat to take a peek behind the scenes, but I've been on the lookout for a utility that offers more than just a pretty interface. And that's basically how I discovered RustNet — a cross-platform network monitoring tool built with Rust. <a href="https://github.com/domcyrus/rustnet" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">RustNet</a> takes an interesting approach by turning your terminal into a live <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/productivity-dashboards-for-browser/" target="_blank">dashboard</a> where you can watch incoming and outgoing connections, see which apps are talking to which services online, and even filter or inspect traffic based on your needs. It's a simple and straightforward way to get a clear view of traffic spikes and background activity that you might not have noticed otherwise. So, if you care about security, performance, or just want to understand your machine's network activity better, I'd highly recommend looking into RustNet as it can potentially turn your good-old command line into a full-fledged network control center.</p>

The RX 9070 XT is the 1440p GPU to buy
<p>When I got my existing gaming PC in 2022, the RTX 3080 was already a 2-year-old card, but still one of the fastest in the world. The RTX 40 series wasn't out yet, and even after it launched, my RTX 3080 was pretty powerful for quite a while. In early 2024, however, it had started to feel limited, especially in the most demanding titles like <em>Alan Wake 2</em> and the path tracing mode in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. I've been thinking about <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/signs-upgrade-graphics-card/" target="_blank">upgrading my GPU</a> for a while, and I think I finally know what I'll be switching to.</p>

Get hyped for the upcoming NBA season with these 5 iconic basketball video games that capture the excitement and flair of the sport.
<p>When the fall season draws near, it brings with it a new season of basketball for fans to get excited about. But as people wait for the first tip-off of NBA basketball to usher in the new season, there are tons of great basketball video games to keep them busy. Over the years, many consoles have featured <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-snes-sports-games-for-every-sport-on-super-nintendo" target="_blank">classic and iconic games</a> that highlighted the appeal of basketball as a sport. But not every game that featured basketball tried to simulate what fans watch on television. Sometimes, they went above and beyond what we know about the game.</p>

Discover why Playwright, an open-source automation framework, is a more secure and reliable choice compared to the privacy-risking AI features of Comet browser.
<p><span style="font-size:11pt; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap"><span style="font-family:Arial,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-weight:400"><span style="font-style:normal"><span style="text-decoration:none">Browsers are changing, and you might have noticed that as well. Developers are pushing hard to integrate AI features, and some of these are already being rolled out. For instance, Edge is heavily embracing AI, and Brave has its own set of features. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-primary-browser-with-dia/" target="_blank">I recently tested Dia</a>, a whole new browser built around AI. But if there’s one browser that has gone all in on AI features, it’s Comet. The newly announced browser from Perplexity comes with agentic AI, which means it can do things for you, like book tickets, summarize videos, compare prices, and more. While it sounds promising, it comes with significant privacy risks. I used it briefly and quickly realized I didn’t need it, since I could just use Playwright instead.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
