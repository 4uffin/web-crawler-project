<![CDATA[I'm using my home's Unbound DNS to block trackers no matter where I am, here's how]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/using-home-unbound-dns-block-trackers/Adam ConwayNetworkingTailscale
Unbound DNS is a great recursive DNS resolver, and you can use it on any device no matter where you are.
<p>I recently got around to setting up <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1015312"><a href="/reasons-run-dns-server-unbound/" target="_blank">Unbound DNS in OPNsense</a></span>, after getting incredibly frustrated with Pi-hole. I had been running it in a Proxmox Linux container (LXC) for the longest time, after it had lived in a TrueNAS container for even longer. Once I migrated to Proxmox, Pi-hole was one of the first services I moved to an LXC and stopped using on TrueNAS, and it worked well... at first.</p>

Learn what this home lab enthusiast wishes they knew before diving in.
<p>I'm fully onboard with the recent push towards self-hosting services and apps, whether to <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1022630"><a href="/save-using-these-self-hosted-services-instead-paid-tools/" target="_blank">reduce subscription costs</a></span>, <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1022553"><a href="/these-self-hosted-apps-cater-to-my-data-hoarding-needs/" target="_blank">retain data sovereignty</a></span>, or pick up some new handy skills. My home lab has NAS units, mini PCs, and is about to get a <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1017976"><a href="/apple-mac-studio-m3-ultra-review/" target="_blank">Mac Studio</a></span> and a powerful Threadripper workstation, all running different tasks. Some of these services came with additional setup <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-people-over-simplify-self-hosting/" target="_blank">that was mostly glossed over by the initial tutorials</a>, but that's far from the only thing that isn't apparent when you take those first few steps into self-hosting.</p>

Explore the highs and lows of the Gears of War franchise as we rank every game from the best to the worst, including the groundbreaking originals and innovative spin-offs.
<p>Few franchises define Xbox quite like <em>Gears of War</em>. Since its debut in 2006, the series has influenced entire generations of shooters. Across spin-offs, sequels, and reimaginings, <em>Gears of War</em> has seen both highs and lows. Some entries revolutionized the shooter genre, while others fell short of expectations. Here, we’ll be ranking every <em>Gears of War</em> game from worst to best.</p>

Discover how free Obsidian plugins can streamline your workflow by replacing dedicated task, calendar, and time tracking apps, all within a single, customizable environment.
<p>Obsidian has become the app I use for just about everything these days, not because of the default features, but because of the free <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/obsidian-features-plugins-regret-not-using-earlier/" target="_blank">community plugins</a> that allow me to make the changes I want so it matches my workflow. Most people juggle separate apps for tasks, boards, notes, and calendars, but I’ve managed to cut that stack in half by keeping it all inside Obsidian.</p>

Power up your smart home devices and streamline your network
<p>While many people prefer to use wireless connections for their devices, wired connections still play a crucial role — especially when reliability is key. With a wired network, not only are you able to achieve faster speed with increased stability, but you can also power devices through the same cable, which is essential for building out a robust smart home. And if you're someone that's considering wiring up their location, that's where a solid PoE switch comes in.</p>

Discover how AntiX Linux, a lightweight OS designed for old machines, breathed new life into an outdated Lenovo laptop. Learn about its easy setup, resource efficiency, and essential app suite that makes it an ideal choice for reviving aging devices.
<p>My old Lenovo laptop no longer supports Windows. The last OS that worked on it was Windows 7, and after that, every app, including modern browsers, stopped working due to the operating system being unsupported. The obvious choice was to install an operating system that runs without hiccups, given the laptop's 2-core second-gen Intel i3 processor and 4GB DDR3 memory. I previously <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/revive-old-laptop-with-raspberry-pi-desktop-os/" target="_blank">tried the Raspberry Pi Desktop OS</a>, but it had a few flaws. It lacked a 64-bit version and was based on Debian 11, with no chance of future upgrades.</p>

Trying to choose between a Kindle, ReMarkable tablet, and an iPad? Here's an easy guide to help you decide.
<p>When I was thinking about getting my first e-reader, I kept coming back to the same question: why not just get a tablet? After all, a tablet, like an iPad, can do a lot more than an e-reader. And what about e-ink notepads like the ReMarkable tablet? They’re more expensive than e-readers, but offer more versatility for note-taking and annotating what you’re reading.</p>

Discover how Donetick, a self-hosted app for managing personal tasks and chores, became an indispensable tool in the author's daily routine despite initial doubts.
<p>Earlier this year, I decided to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/self-hosting-donetick-for-chores/" target="_blank">try out Donetick to help me with my chores</a>. While my experience with the app was positive, I often find that I stop using many self-hosted services after some time. This is partly due to my becoming overwhelmed when switching between too many apps and my general resistance to changing my routine.</p>

Grab it before the deal vanishes.
<p>We've seen a few good sales on Steam lately (such as <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1023313"><a href="/beloved-military-sim-91-positive-reviews-3-dollars-on-steam/" target="_blank">this popular military sim</a></span> going as low as $3), but when you're talking pure value for money, you really can't go wrong with free. Steam often hosts "play for free" events, where people can try out a game without paying a cent, with the caveat that it's only available for a short amount of time, after which you'll need to buy it. However, very rarely, we'll see a game go "free to keep", which means that if you grab it during its promotional window, you own it—forever.</p>

Eden Emulator arrives on mobile.
<p>Nintendo is often embroiled in a battle against pirates and individuals who emulate its games. Every new hardware generation, Nintendo adds some new countermeasures to protect its systems, and people find a way to circumvent them. It ends up being an arms race until Nintendo pulls out the strongest counter-attack it can muster: full-blown legal action.</p>
