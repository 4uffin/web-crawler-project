<![CDATA[3 reasons why I pay a lot of attention to the RAM when buying or building a NAS]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/i-pay-a-lot-of-attention-to-the-ram-for-my-nas/Ayush PandeNASHome Lab
RAM may seem inconsequential when looking for a NAS, but you shouldn't skimp out on it
<p>When I’m out buying a NAS or checking out the components for a custom storage server, there are a couple of factors I take into consideration. The number of drive bays lies at the top of the priority list, and I often run some internal calculations about the storage capacity before locking in on a NAS. Likewise, the RAM is something I never skimp out on – even on the more affordable builds. In fact, it’s something I pay a lot of attention to when hunting for pre-built NAS units or putting together one myself.</p>

Discover the powerful features and user-friendly design that make Tandoor the superior open-source recipe management tool over Mealie.
<p>As a longtime user of Mealie, I thought I had found the perfect self-hosted solution for managing my recipes. It was reliable, straightforward, and got the job done for a while. However, over time, I began to encounter some limitations that left me wanting more features and flexibility. I wanted a robust system for organizing my ever-growing recipe collection. That’s when I discovered Tandoor, which promised to be the upgrade I was looking for.</p>

Your outdated laptop can double as a rock-solid PVE workstation
<p>As someone who grew up drooling over server PCs, I got quite a whiplash after realizing that you don’t need enterprise-grade hardware for computing projects. Sure, bulky systems with tons of RAM and CPU cores can handle virtualization-heavy workloads. But if you’ve got old systems lying around, you can repurpose them into reliable self-hosting and experimentation rigs.</p>

Raycast is finally coming to Windows, and it's improving some of my favorite features built into the operating system.
<p>If you read my recent piece on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/moved-away-from-windows-11-but-didnt-go-to-linux/" target="_blank">switching from Windows to Mac</a>, you might know that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/raycast-productivity-superpower-mac-users/" target="_blank">Raycast is one of my absolute favorite pieces of software</a> ever. I absolutely love everything it offers, and when I heard it was coming to Windows, needless to say, I was ecstatic. The beta opened up recently, and I finally got an invite to try it for myself.</p>

An AI writing partner that keeps me on track
<p>I write a lot: articles, novel drafts, research notes. The struggle isn’t always the writing itself, it’s managing everything around it. I have so much scattered research and half-written drafts that always end up buried somewhere. I’ve also <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-dozens-note-taking-apps-keep-coming-back-tool/" target="_blank">tried dozens of notes apps</a> and AI tools, but many of them overwhelm me with features or give me generic results.</p>

NotebookLM’s apparently a coding sidekick I didn’t know I needed.
<p>I'm currently majoring in computer science, and most of my daily classes revolve around coding. And while I’ve always been passionate about my major and genuinely enjoy coding, I’d be lying if I said it’s easy. It can get overwhelming at times, and learning (let alone retaining) everything taught in class isn’t always straightforward.</p>

And it even steals a page from macOS.
<p>Whether it's a research assistant like NotebookLM, a new foldable, or a handy Gmail feature, Google is always working on something or another. But one thing we don't see the tech giant do often is drop a dedicated Windows app.</p>

Discover which gaming accessories can harm your consoles and learn why it's best to avoid them, even if they seem convenient or affordable.
<p>Having extra accessories for a video game console can be pretty helpful. While most first-party accessories can enhance the experience of playing games, they can also make some aspects of gaming easier and more comfortable. However, there are also accessories on the market that don't do things better, but can rather be harmful to your system. And if you're not careful, the wrong accessory can do irreparable damage to a very expensive video game console. That's a problem nobody wants to find themselves dealing with.</p>

Old habits die hard.
<p>If you've used a Windows PC, you might have noticed that the main system drive is labeled "C:" by default and caught yourself wondering what happened to "A:" or "B:". After all, the alphabet doesn't start with "C," so what's going on there? This naming quirk actually has a reason for existing, and it dates back to the early days of personal computing. Like a lot of things, it's rooted in historical conventions and legacy hardware.</p>
