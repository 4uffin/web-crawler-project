Summary
Borderlands 4 hits well, praised for its writing, gunplay, and seamless co-op; some performance complaints linger.
The retail price is $70 (not $80); Nvidia offers a free copy if you purchase GeForce Now Ultimate yearly.
GeForce Now Ultimate is $200/yr, including RTX 4080/5080 rigs on select titles; the free game claim ends on September 25.
Borderlands 4 is now out in the wild, and there's a lot to love and criticize. While people are complaining about the performance issues, it seems they're also gelling with the actual meat and potatoes of the game. In fact, our delightful sister website, GameRant, gave Gearbox's latest title a highly respectable 9/10 score, citing performance as a minor ding but praising the writing, gunplay, and seamless multiplayer experience. There was a bit of a scare where people thought Borderlands 4 would cost $80; fortunately, the actual price was a more agreeable $70. If that's still a bit dire for you, Nvidia is actually giving away copies of the game, albeit you can't just walk up and ask them for one, I'm afraid.
Nvidia is giving away copies of Borderlands 4 if you subscribe to a yearly Ultimate plan with GeForce Now
Over on the Nvidia GeForce Now subscription page (thanks, Neowin!), Nvidia has added a new incentive to get people subscribing to a yearly Ultimate plan for GeForce Now. If you've never heard of GeForce Now, it's a cloud gaming service that Nvidia provides. Subscribing to GeForce Now isn't like Xbox Game Pass, where it also unlocks games for you to play; however, you can link your PC storefronts (like Steam) and play your supported, purchased titles on them instead. There are three tiers: Basic, Performance, and Ultimate. Basic is free with ads, and is a good way to see if GeForce Now works for you. The Performance tier gives you longer play times and less of a wait to get in, and Ultimate subscribers get the cream of the crop, including an RTX 4080 rig at the very least and an RTX 5080 on select titles. Well, if that sounds good to you, then you can grab a complimentary copy of Borderlands 4 when you subscribe to the Ultimate tier for a year. I recommend giving GeForce Now a try first, as a year's worth of Ultimate costs $200. However, if you end up liking GeForce Now and want to subscribe for a year, you'll also get a $70 game for free and a souped-up rig to play it on. Sounds like a win-win to me. You only have until September 25th to claim this reward, so don't dawdle too long. And if you need help deciding, check out our review of the Nvidia GeForce Now Ultimate subscription tier.
