About XDA
XDA was founded in 2003 and acquired by Valnet Inc. in 2022 and its mission is to become the world’s greatest computing publication by bringing our readers the latest industry news, comprehensive and unbiased product reviews, insightful editorials, and detailed how-to guides. Our publications cover all aspects of computing, including desktops, laptops, PC components, gaming handhelds, peripherals, emerging technologies like AI / VR, and the software that powers it all.
XDA started its journey as a mobile development forum for one of the first true smartphones, the legendary O2 XDA. In the early 2010s, XDA expanded its scope to Android devices and rose to become one of the largest global Android resources. In the years since, we evolved into a class-leading digital publication and shifted our insights from smartphones to computing.
