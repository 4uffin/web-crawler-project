It's been 40 years since Super Mario Bros. came out and the titular plumber is still going strong
Seriously, 40 years is a long time, and Mario has been curbstomping Goombas for every minute of it. Whether he's running around with his brother Luigi or pairing up with dinosaurs, talking hats and more, Mario has been a part of the gaming landscape for young, and the young-at-heart. I can't wait for the next outing (and his first on the Nintendo Switch 2), because I've played every game to date and Nintendo's first-party titles are always worth picking up. Is Mario your favorite or is another Nintendo character in that top slot?Joe_Rice-JonesJoe_Rice-JonesPosts
Virtual Boy games are coming to the Switch 2 and I am losing my mind
Nintendo has just held its latest Direct showcase going over numerous upcoming games for the Switch and Switch 2. There were some great announcements in there, but none shocked me more than the addition of Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Classics library on both Switch and Switch 2.
The Virtual Boy is infamously Nintendo's worst selling console hardware, recorded at 770,000 units sold worldwide, though the hardware was never launched in Europe. This addition to the Nintendo Classics library is also going to require an add-on that pretty much replicates the look of that original hardware, and it'll be available in all major markets, meaning it's more than likely it will sell more than the original hardware.
I'm just absolutely befuddled that this is happening now, when Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to re-release these games on the 3DS and never did it. But there's no way around the fact that this is at least interesting.JoaoJoaoPosts
Rolling releases vs. fixed releases: Which do you prefer?
I've long used fixed-released operating systems that require major upgrades to bring the underlying code up to scratch with the latest updates that aren't minor. In recent times, I've gradually moved to rolling-release Linux distros and much prefer being able to update just about every part of the OS without having to wait for the developers to roll out a major upgrade. But which do you prefer?RichardRichardPosts
Nintendo has another hour-long show coming this week
Nintendo has just announced its first "general" Nintendo Direct since it launched the Switch 2 over three months ago, and suffice it to say, it feels like it's going to be a banger. Partly because Nintendo skipped its usual June showcase, which means we're overdue for a deluge of Nintendo news, but also because Nintendo is kind of promising exactly that.
According to the company, this will be a roughly 60-minute long show, which makes it the longest general Direct ever, if we exclude the April showcase that was exclusively focused on revealing the Switch 2 and its launch lineup. There are no expected hardware announcements this time around, so it's all about the games (and maybe the sequel to the Mario movie), which makes it all the more exciting.JoaoJoaoPosts
I low-key want to 3D print a rack for my SBCs
The lightweight champ Raspberry Pi Zero began my obsession with Single-Board Computers, and I've since expanded my collection to include everything from Arm boards to x86 units and RISC-V SBCs. Thanks to their small size and low power consumption, I run a handful of these SBCs in my home lab. Unfortunately, I don't own a proper rack for them, and all my attempts at finding the one that suits my needs have ended in vain.
However, I recently came across some forums and idea boards where tinkerers showed off their 3D-printed racks. And now I really want to print one for my arsenal of SBCs. Of course, I'll have to research the right schematics and filament type, but it seems like a fun weekend project.AyushAyushPosts
Beeper is still the best thing to happen to messaging apps
It's been well over a year now since I first wrote about Beeper and how much I loved it. Seeing as we've never covered it again, you might think that was something of a fluff piece, but make no mistake: Beeper has been an absolutely consistent presence on every device I use.
Beeper does require a level of trust, as you're technically signing into various messaging services on a remote device that isn't yours, but honestly, I've just been loving the convenience so much.  All of my messaging apps now live under one roof, so whether it's SMS, Facebook Messenger, Discord, or Telegram, I can use it all in one place, and it's so convenient.
The only downside is Facebook Messenger continues to be annoying and randomly disconnecting once every week or so, forcing me to login again. WhatsApp also disconnected me at first, but it only requires me to keep the app installed in order to prevent that from happening. That's not enough for Messenger, and I can only hope a fix will come at some pointJoaoJoaoPosts
Someone figured out how to use SSDs in an unmodded Xbox 360
The Xbox 360 has been around for two decades now, and in all that time, the internal storage drive has always been mechanical hard drives. That's down to Microsoft putting security restrictions on the console so that only a few hard drives would work. Console modders figured out how to firmware mod hard drives to use non-approved ones, but it took until this week for those modders to figure out how to modify SSD firmware so that the Xbox 360 can finally get the speedy storage as a solution. After so many years, it's incredible to see enthusiasts still finding new ways to improve these consoles.Joe_Rice-JonesJoe_Rice-JonesPosts
How many case fans does your PC have?
Besides dust buildup, high temps are easily the biggest nemesis of PCs, and you could end up lowering the longevity of your painstakingly-assembled rig if you take your fan placement lightly. Me? I've got an arsenal of fans attached to my PC cabinet. I've installed three 140mm fans as intakes on the front, with two 120mm fans at the top and another 120mm on the back acting as exhausts. That way, my cabinet has slightly positive pressure, which is ideal for folks like myself who want lower temps without too much dust accumulation. What about you? How many fans does your gaming machine possess?AyushAyushPosts
Grip cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 feel more like a problem than a solution
I received a couple of grip cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 when it first launched so I could test them, and they did improve my comfort. Recently, I picked the Dbrand Killswitch back up because I noticed my hand sweat/grease was quite visible on the Joy-Con 2 and I want to preserve the look of the plastic.
But it's not really a matter of comfort for me, and frankly, in terms of protecting the console, I worry that using one on these grips cases causes more damage than it prevents. Applying them is fairly difficult, and I worry that I'm going to scratch something. I recently ordered a Dbrand skin instead, but I can't even remove the Killswitch case because I'm worried about removing and reinstalling it potenitally causing more damage. At the end of the day, I'd just rather use skins than grip cases.JoaoJoaoPosts

Are you playing Kirby and the Forgotten Land on the Switch 2?
Nintendo just released the Switch 2 Edition upgrade for Kirby and the Forgotten Land earlier this week, and as a huge Nintendo fan, of course I'm already all over it. So far, the new campaign seems like more of what we saw before, and that's not a bad thing considering the game was phenomenal from the start. I do think the new levels are beautiful, too, but maybe I'm just simple-minded and love sparkly things. Plus, everything runs more smoothly and at a higher resolution, so that's nice.
What I'm currently most curious about is the new boss rush difficulty that's introduced in this new edition. I remember beating the ahrdest difficulty in the base game, but it's been a while and I'm a little rusty. Have you already beaten the new content? What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear them!

I'm starting to grow fond of FreeBSD distros
TrueNAS Core was the first FreeBSD distro I tinkered with, and it was (and low-key still is) a surprisingly robust distribution for a DIY storage server. But after transitioning to TrueNAS Scale, OPNsense was my only link to the FreeBSD world for a long time.
However, all that changed when I came across GhostBSD earlier this year. Contrary to my expectations, it's a rock-solid general-purpose distro, and it's what pushed me into the FreeBSD scene yet again. I also recently installed NomadBSD on a flash drive, and I've been loving it so far.

What do you wish your Google Nest Hub could do?
I've been playing around with building my own Google Nest Hub alternative, and I've been using an Elecrow 7-inch ESP32-based display for building it up. I'm implementing typical "idle" pages that will surface controls for my home, but what can a Nest Hub not do that I could implement as well? I'm curious; there aren't many things I wish mine could do out of the box, but there are lots of silly things I could implement that are fun.

I'm back in the custom Android ROM game
Lately, I've been getting more and more into Linux as a replacement for Windows 11, and I've recently installed Arch Linux with KDE on one of my preferred laptops. It seems this has gotten a little bug in me, as recently I started wondering about installing Lineage OS on my Android phone, too, especially after Google started threatening to block sideloading of Android apps from unverified developers.
Well, that wonder quickly turned into action as last night I flashed Lineage OS 22.2 (Android 15) on my Fairphone 5, and so far, I really like it. I opted to include Google apps as I do have use for them, but it's nice that I can uninstall all the things I don't need. Plus, this just seems to perform a lot better than Fairphone's stock Android ROM, so I think I might be staying on LineageOS for a while.

It's been 34 years since the first iteration of Linux
Thirty-four years ago, Linus Torvalds announced his "free" operating system to the world, with just a few more than ten thousand lines of code inside it. Now, that many lines are added to the kernel daily, with over 34 million lines of code contributed to by thousands of dedicated developers worldwide. It powers everything from gaming consoles to routers, servers, the top 500 supercomputers, and more, and it will only grow from here. Who knows what the next few decades will hold, especially once Torvalds retires and other maintainers take control, but Linux isn't going anywhere.

I just upgraded my router, and I'm blown away
I recently switched internet providers to a much cheaper one, and while the advertised download speeds are the same, I've found that the provided router from this new ISP is much worse than my old one, with noticeably worse Wi-Fi speeds when I'm right next to it, and even more so when I move to a different room.
Some Reddit users recommended me a router called Flint 2 from GL.iNet, and I finally caved, and I have to say, I'm blown away by its performance. Connecting it via cable to my ISP's router and using its Wi-Fi is a night-and-day difference. Performance in my office is almost as good as being right next to the router, and in all cases, it's noticeably faster than the included router.

Be honest, how many wins do you have against the Everdark version of Libra in Nightreign?
When Fromsoftware announced the Everdark variant of Libra, Creature of Night, I was itching to fight the Equilibrious Beast. And between the never-ending army of invaders, random madness-inducing AoEs, and ocassional "deals" from Libra, the boss fight exceeded all my expectations.
Truth be told, I loved the boss fight, even though I've only beaten the Everdark Sovereign twice. The first win was due to my team finding Marais Executioner's Greatswords (yes, we found more than one) during the first day in Nokstella and grinding several enemies to buff the weapon. The other time, it was all thanks to a skilled Ironeye carrying us through the fight. What about you? How many wins do you have against this challenging boss?

If WinApps gets proper Wayland support, I never want to touch Windows again
I've been more and more interested in the Linux space over the past few months, and I just recently mentioned I only use Windows because I have to. Well, today, a friend of mine told me about WinApps, a project that containerizes Windows so you can run apps like Microsoft Office or Adobe Creative Cloud without real-time translation and the potential bugs that come with it.
Sadly, it seems WinApps is still designed around x11 and won't work on Wayland, but if that changes soon, I think I might not have a reason to use a Windows PC anymore. I can't wait for that day, honestly.

This LED matrix display is one of the best uses for an ESP32 I've found
The ESP32 is a ridiculously versatile microcontroller, and you can connect practically anything to it with some technical know-how and programming skills. One example of that has been the HUB75-based Waveshare 64x32 matrix LED panel, which I've been absolutely loving. It looks good, it's easy to use (once you get the hang of things), and it's one of the most practical uses I've had to dedicate an ESP32 to.
What other devices have you been using with your microcontrollers?

The iMac is 27 years old and boy do my knees hurt reading that
The iMac's enduring place in the market is a far cry from the Macintosh machines that nearly sank Apple as a company in the 1980s and 90s. Those were beige, soulless boxes with confusing options, while the iMac was an instant design classic, and every iteration has been a banger. Bright colors, high performance thanks to the deep integration of macOS with the hardware it's running on, and everything you need in one box, including speakers, a mouse, and a keyboard. Throw in good networking, and you had the fastest and easiest way to get on the fledgling internet in the late 1990s. Now you have Apple Silicon and fantastic display quality, wrapped in a super slim chassis, and the iMac virtually sells itself. Here's to the next quarter century!

RAM ranks high on my priority list when I'm hunting for a new NAS
When you're planning to buy a Network-Attached Storage system, you'll probably pay a lot of attention to its Ethernet provisions, drive bay count, support for NVMe drives, and other storage/network aspects. After all, you don't need a beefy processor for a storage server. However, I pay a lot of attention to the amount of RAM that ships with a NAS.
That's because I prefer ZFS to other file systems, which is infamous for hogging up extra memory. For a powerful server with massive RAID pools, I'd rather not starve my ZFS arrays on the RAM front. And that's before you include the lightning-fast speeds my HDDs could achieve after enabling RAM caches.

Moving my home lab to a new network was easier than expected
Recently, I signed up for a new internet service, which was installed and set up yesterday. I thought switching to this new service would cause some problems with my home lab due to the changes in the internal IP, but to my surprise, the transition was relatively easy.
I just changed the home lab's IP address in Proxmox, powered it down, switched the connection over, and booted it back up. Everything went super smoothly. Even my NAS, which is a VM inside Proxmox, worked mostly fine, I just had to change the IP and restart the system to make sure it could connect to the internet and properly launch Docker for my containers. Of course, I also had to change the IP addresses in Nginx Proxy Manager to use with my cusotm domain, but that too was a quick fix. it just goes to show these things are often easier than you'd expect.

Do you use any MCP servers?
I've been doing a bit of a deep dive into MCP, and the entire ecosystem is absolutely fascinating. There's an MCP server for practically every service out there, and I've come across them for Windows 11, Spotify, Docker, and so many other services. Are you using any?

It's been 25 years since the first ATI Radeon GPU
ATI was still its own company at the turn of the millennium, long before AMD folded them into its graphics division. The venerable ATI Rage line of graphics processors was getting long in the tooth and lacked hardware geometry acceleration and efficiency. And then, in August 2000, the Radeon R100 was unleashed on the world in a flurry of reviews. Those reviews are (mostly) gone from the net now, as is the ATI branding, but the Radeon name lives on as the graphics division for AMD. I've lost count of how many AMD GPUs I've used in those decades, how about you?

I got 100% completion in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but I'm not sure I recommend it
Over the past weekend or so, I hit a few gaming achievements: 100% completion of Donkey Kong Bananza, followed by finishing the original Donkey Kong Country on the SNES (through the NSO app), and finally, I achieved 100% completion in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
I had already beaten the game after it came out, and tried to do as much as I could within it without any guides. But with the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of the game available, the Nintendo Switch App provided guidance to achieve full completion of the game, and that's exactly what I did. Every Korok seed, every voice memory (also a Switch 2 Edition exclusive), everything. And while I'm glad I did that, I do think this portion of the game is much less interesting. The navigation feature turns the game into a waypoint game, where you just head to the next thing on the map every time, and it takes away the magic of the title.
If this is your first time playing the game, I actually recommend playing it without look

I love fighting the newest Everdark Sovereign in Nightreign
When Fromsoftware announced the next batch of Everdark Sovereigns for Nightreign, I was really excited to test my mettle against Libra. Fighting the Equilibrious Beast was already a challenge in the base game, and I wanted to see how they'd enhance the boss. And well, the new boss fight exceeded my expectations in every way.
The summoned enemies add more chaos (pun-intended) to the fight, and the random "deals" that Libra can activate in the middle of the battle make everything even more frantic. I've only beaten the boss once so far, and I'd credit that win to the Marais Executioner's Swords we found on Day 1 in Noklateo. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable fight, even though it can get a little too challenging at times.

After using Windows for decades, I barely touch it these days
I've mentioned before that, prior to getting a Mac Mini last November, I had only ever used Windows PCs. While the Mac Mini quickly became my main PC, I still used Windows on my laptops when I needed to be away from my desk. But these days, I rarely feel any interest in doing so.
It's true that I spend a lot of time trying different Linux distros because of work, but even if I didn't have to, I find myself preferring to use Linux more and more. There are some issues with app and hardware compatibility sometimes, but it's overall more pleasant and customizable experience, so I've started to lose a lot of interest in using Windows. I'd argue I feel more forced to use Windows for work than I do Linux.

I wish Linux were better on tablets
I've been trying a lot of different things lately when it comes to Linux and operating systems, and earlier this week, I went hands-on with FydeOS on an old 2-in-1 laptop. Suffice it to say, it's easily the best experience you can get on a tablet-like PC, with great, smooth interactions and gestures.
I had a lot of hope that more mainstream Linux distros would have developed better support for tablets, but with the market being relatively small to begin with, I can understand why that's not the case. But with Microsoft fumbling the bag so hard when it comes to... everything, I wish there were more alternatives. That being said, FydeOS is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

I'm kinda over my desire for a rackmount server
I've always wanted a rack-mount server for storage and home lab use, and now I finally have space for one. But I'm rethinking those plans, because recent Mini PCs I've used have shown me that I can run most of the things I want on power-efficient hardware. I'm sure I'll end up with a rack mount at some point because my NAS is running out of space and the next storage upgrade is going to need more bays, but until then, I'm going to host as many things as possible on Mini PCs and see how things go.

I finished Donkey Kong Bananza's story, and it's amazing
After multiple weeks, I've finally reached the end credits on Donkey Kong Bananza, and all I can say is it's incredibly impressive that we're only two months into the Switch 2's lifecycle, and the console already has two absolute killer titles. Bananza is one of the most freeing and fun-filled experiences Nintendo has ever made, and the basic concept of destroying everything never stops being satisfying.
Donkey Kong Bananza is filled with unique level designs and interesting environments, fun characters (with the protagonist duo being particularly great), smooth controls, and satisfying feedback that make the game fun all the way through. It's not absolutely perfect, but it comes very close.
