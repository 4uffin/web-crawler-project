If you're looking for a portable mouse that delivers smooth tracking with excellent reliability and features, then the Logitech Signature M550 is going to be a great choice. While it's normally priced at $30, we're now seeing a sharp discount that brings it down by 50%. This is one of the best discounts on this model that we've seen, and it is an actual no-brainer at just $15. But you'll want to be quick because a promotion like this won't last long.

It might be hard to get excited about a mouse, but it's one of the primary ways you interact with your PC, which makes it one of the more important tools connected to your computer. And since some people spend hours on their computers each day, it's important to get something that's going to be reliable, accurate, and comfortable.
The Logitech Signature M550 is a great example, coming in a smaller size but still packed with features. You get a contoured shape, soft thumb area, and side grips made from rubber in order to keep your hand gripped to the mouse. It's also quite silent as well, with Logitech claiming 90% less 'click noise' with its SilentTouch technology.
There's also the SmartWheel that gives you excellent control when scrolling, with the ability to switch between high speed and precision movements with just a small flick. The mouse also provides excellent run time of up to two years with a single AA battery. Logitech also provides two ways to connect, with Bluetooth and Logi Bolt. The latter will be more reliable thanks to its 2.4Ghz connection, but both will work well.
Compatibility is also quite good too, and the mouse can be used with nearly any type of device, with support for Windows, macOS, Android, Linux, Chrome OS, Apple devices, and more. The best part is that this mouse isn't all that expensive right now, coming in at just $15 for a very limited time. It's great for home, office, or taking it with you on the go.
