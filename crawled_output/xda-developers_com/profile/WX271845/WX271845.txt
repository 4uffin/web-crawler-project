How do you feel about roguelike games?
After the Nintendo Direct presentation last Friday, I quickly bought the DK Island & Emerald Rush DLC for Donkey Kong Bananza, mostly because I love the base game and figured I'd have fun with it. The DLC contains a rogue-like mode where you have to collect as much emerald ore as possible in a limited time.
I find the concept intriguing, and it's decently to fun to play in the moment, but I've found it hard to stay invested in the game as it feels like there's no real progress being made. It could also be that I'm bad at the game, but I've felt similarly about games like Dead Cells, which has me thinking I might just not like this genre. Do you like roguelike games, or do you prefer games that have a more defined path to progression?

Virtual Boy games are coming to the Switch 2 and I am losing my mind
Nintendo has just held its latest Direct showcase going over numerous upcoming games for the Switch and Switch 2. There were some great announcements in there, but none shocked me more than the addition of Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Classics library on both Switch and Switch 2.
The Virtual Boy is infamously Nintendo's worst selling console hardware, recorded at 770,000 units sold worldwide, though the hardware was never launched in Europe. This addition to the Nintendo Classics library is also going to require an add-on that pretty much replicates the look of that original hardware, and it'll be available in all major markets, meaning it's more than likely it will sell more than the original hardware.
I'm just absolutely befuddled that this is happening now, when Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to re-release these games on the 3DS and never did it. But there's no way around the fact that this is at least interesting.

Nintendo has another hour-long show coming this week
Nintendo has just announced its first "general" Nintendo Direct since it launched the Switch 2 over three months ago, and suffice it to say, it feels like it's going to be a banger. Partly because Nintendo skipped its usual June showcase, which means we're overdue for a deluge of Nintendo news, but also because Nintendo is kind of promising exactly that.
According to the company, this will be a roughly 60-minute long show, which makes it the longest general Direct ever, if we exclude the April showcase that was exclusively focused on revealing the Switch 2 and its launch lineup. There are no expected hardware announcements this time around, so it's all about the games (and maybe the sequel to the Mario movie), which makes it all the more exciting.

Beeper is still the best thing to happen to messaging apps
It's been well over a year now since I first wrote about Beeper and how much I loved it. Seeing as we've never covered it again, you might think that was something of a fluff piece, but make no mistake: Beeper has been an absolutely consistent presence on every device I use.
Beeper does require a level of trust, as you're technically signing into various messaging services on a remote device that isn't yours, but honestly, I've just been loving the convenience so much.  All of my messaging apps now live under one roof, so whether it's SMS, Facebook Messenger, Discord, or Telegram, I can use it all in one place, and it's so convenient.
The only downside is Facebook Messenger continues to be annoying and randomly disconnecting once every week or so, forcing me to login again. WhatsApp also disconnected me at first, but it only requires me to keep the app installed in order to prevent that from happening. That's not enough for Messenger, and I can only hope a fix will come at some point

Grip cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 feel more like a problem than a solution
I received a couple of grip cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 when it first launched so I could test them, and they did improve my comfort. Recently, I picked the Dbrand Killswitch back up because I noticed my hand sweat/grease was quite visible on the Joy-Con 2 and I want to preserve the look of the plastic.
But it's not really a matter of comfort for me, and frankly, in terms of protecting the console, I worry that using one on these grips cases causes more damage than it prevents. Applying them is fairly difficult, and I worry that I'm going to scratch something. I recently ordered a Dbrand skin instead, but I can't even remove the Killswitch case because I'm worried about removing and reinstalling it potenitally causing more damage. At the end of the day, I'd just rather use skins than grip cases.

I finally updated my Immich storage configuration
For the past few weeks, my self-hosted Immich server has been blocked from upgrading due to requiring changes to my storage configuration. For whatever reason, the project has made it so that your immich files need to be stored in regular folders rather than dedicated datasets for each type of data, which I don't really get.
This was quite annoying, too, because the warnings in TrueNAS did a terrible job at providing guidance on how to move my existing data to the new format, so I was experimenting for a bit and it wouldn't work. Thankfully, I found a proper guide last night and was able to follow the steps to make everything work correctly. It feels nice to finally have my NAS and its apps up to date. Did you have any trouble migrating your Immich storage?

I moved away from Windows 11, but I didn't go to Linux
Of course, only an article paid by Apple would feature such high praise as "Customization... exists" in one of the headers. Smart investment on their part, really.

True, but you can ignore the donation and use the classic installer link to get it for free.

You can download the app for free from the website, I would recommend doing that before going through the Microsoft Store.

My family stopped using Google Photos and OneDrive after installing this container
Valid question! The mini PC is running a lot more than Immich since it's a Proxmox system with TrueNAS (which has Immich and other apps) and Home Assistant VMs
