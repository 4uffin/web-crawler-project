Summary
Subscriptions (Copilot Pro, Microsoft 365) are Microsoft’s primary source of consumer revenue.
Windows 11 beta tests a full-screen SCOOBE reminder at boot to push lapsed Microsoft 365 renewals.
Dialog can't be dismissed; only a 'remind me later' button is offered.
While Windows is Microsoft's most famous software, it's likely not a huge money-maker for the company. I don't have its books on hand, but I can't imagine that people buying a new PC with a Windows 11 license once every three to five years is keeping it afloat. And that's not including the people who upgraded from Windows 10 to 11 for free. No, it's the subscriptions that are likely keeping Microsoft ticking over. Currently, the company has two major revenue streams on the consumer side: Copilot Pro and Microsoft 365. And while Microsoft is trying to encourage more people to subscribe to the former by adding Copilot to more and more products, it seems the company wants to test out maintaining the latter by chasing up people who allowed their subscription to lapse.

As spotted by Neowin, our story begins in the most recent Windows 11 Dev and Beta build. These patches are still in testing, so there's no guarantee that they'll ever reach the release window. However, it's still a good insight as to what Microsoft is toying around with at the very least, so they're always worth a look. The patches were pretty standard, but there was this one nugget:
We’re introducing a simple reminder that appears as a SCOOBE screen (Second Chance Out of Box Experience) to let you know your Microsoft subscription needs attention (for example, if a renewal payment didn’t go through). In just a few clicks, you can review and update your payment method and keep your subscription benefits uninterrupted.
Well, it seems that Microsoft and I have differing opinions on what constitutes a "simple reminder." It turns out that Microsoft's idea is a large, full-screen ad that pops up when you're booting up your PC. This will inform you that, hey, your Microsoft 365 subscription appears to be nearing its end soon. If you let it expire, Microsoft will notify you of all the stuff you're about to lose. And as you might imagine from a Microsoft product, you can't say "no" to this dialog; instead, you can tell it to "remind me later." Presumably with another big screen. Again, this feature is in testing, so it may not make it to release, but just be ready for it should it actually come out. If you're a bit tired of Microsoft pushing you to use 365, check out these free Microsoft Office alternatives that might be even better than the real deal. Just be prepared for a bit of culture shock, as there are several reasons why it's challenging to switch from Microsoft 365 to a free alternative.
