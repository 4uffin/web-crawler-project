You've probably heard about switches before, but if you've never dabbled with PoE, it's a good way to get power to your connected devices without running another set of cables. Just by connecting compatible devices using Ethernet with PoE, you can have a simultaneous data and power connection. As you can imagine, this is quite convenient and can even be a lifesaver in some situations. The only downside is that you need to find a switch that works for you and fits within your budget. While it might still be a little on the pricey side, we think this D-Link switch might be a good fit, thanks to its steep 44% discount that drops it down to $90.
Connect your home in a new way
As far as what you get, this switch has 8 PoE Gigabit ports, which means you can supply power for up to eight compatible devices. However, there is a limit on how much power you can supply using a switch, and for this one, it's going to be up to 65W across all ports. Naturally, you can connect cameras, phones, PCs, and more.
So as you can imagine, it's very convenient to have something like this in your home, office, or even home lab. And just in case you need to take things to another level, this switch also has two Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP) slots. SFP is a good way to go if you need the best speeds and coverage, but otherwise, Ethernet should be more than fine.
Of course, this switch offers a ton more, and you'll want to check out the product page to get the full details, but for the most part, we think this is a solid offering at the price. Plus, D-Link throws in a lifetime warranty on this product so you can be sure that it will be extremely reliable.
