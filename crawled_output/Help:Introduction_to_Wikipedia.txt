From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Introduction to contributing to Wikipedia
Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, written collaboratively by the people who use it. Since 2001, it has grown rapidly to become the world's largest reference website, with 7.1 million articles in English attracting billions of views every month. For a more detailed account of the project, see About Wikipedia.
How you can contribute
Don't be afraid to edit – Anyone can edit almost every page; just find something that can be improved and make it better! You can add content (using references to support your claims), upload free-to-use images, correct spelling and grammar mistakes, improve prose to make it more readable, or help with any number of other tasks. It's normal for new contributors to feel a little overwhelmed by all of our policies, but don't worry if you don't understand everything at first. It's fine to use common sense as you edit, and if you accidentally make a mistake, another editor can always fix or improve it later. So go ahead, edit an article, and help make Wikipedia the world's best information source!
Suggest improvements – Each article also has a "Talk" page, where you can suggest improvements and corrections to the article.
