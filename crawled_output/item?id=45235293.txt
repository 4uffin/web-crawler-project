Went down the MI300A rabbit hole that was just casually mentioned in this post (https://chipsandcheese.com/p/inside-the-amd-radeon-instinct-...). What a fun chip! (and blog!)replyerulabs 8 hours ago

Lower power consumption on a desktop monitor is an interesting technical challenge but I do wonder “Cui bono?” - obviously I’d want my gaming machine to consume less power but I’m not sure I’ve ever considered mouse-idle monitor-on power consumption when considering eg AMD versus Nvidia for my gaming machine.Don’t get me wrong this is very interesting and AMD does great engineering and I loath to throw shade on an engineering focused company but… Is this going to convert to even a single net gain purchase for AMD?I’m a relatively (to myself) a large AMD shareholder (colloquially: fanboy) and damn I’d love to see more focus on hardware matmul acceleration rather than idle monitor power draw.replyLuker88 6 hours ago

Some people appreciate leaving the pc open for light tasks even at night, and wasting too much power doing nothing is... well, wasteful. Imagine a home server that has the GPU for AI or multimedia stuff.The same architecture will also be used in mobile, so depending on where this comes from (architecturally) it could mean more power savings there, too.Besides, lower power also means lower cooling/noise on idle, and shorter cooldown times after a burst of work.And since AMD is slowly going to the (ever next-time) unified architecture, any gains there will also mean less idle power draw in other environments, like servers.Nothing groundbreaking, sure, but I won't say no to all of that.replymasfuerte 29 minutes ago

They have optimized idle performance for when the display is still on.
Which is nice, but configuring the screen to switch off when idle will save far more power.replydelusional 3 hours ago

For the past decade my home server is also my desktop workstation. According to canon people shouldn't do this because the workstation might crash or be updated more frequently or create conflicting resource usage, but with containers it's never been a problem for me and lets me have one more capable computer (with dGPU) essentially for each purpose, rather than managing two systems, one of which I only use for ~20 hours a week (I usually use my laptop). However I definitely would like it to use as little power when in low processing states.replyThatPlayer 2 hours ago

Is a PiKVM considered a display? I've got one attached to my home server. Alongside the dedicated graphics card, it probably uses more power than usual server motherboard KVMs, but it's still cheaper and accessible for home servers.replyWhyNotHugo 45 minutes ago

I definitely value lower power usage when idle. My desktop PC uses ~150W when idle. Sometimes I leave it on overnight simply downloading a remote file or some other extremely light operation.It doesn't make sense that it would draw this much power. A laptop can do the same thing with ~10W.This sort of improvement might not increase sales with one generation, but it'll make a difference if they keep focusing on this year after year. It also makes their design easier to translate into mobile platforms.replydragontamer 47 minutes ago

If the tech was developed, then might as well deploy it to both laptops (likely it's original intent), as well as Desktop.replyjayd16 8 hours ago

Rumors have been floating around about some kind of PS6 portable or next gen steam deck with RDNA4 where power consumption matters.There's also simply laptop longevity that would be nice.replykokada 5 hours ago

I am not saying that this was the reason I bought it, but I recently purchased a Radeon 9070 and I was surprised how little power this card uses in idle. I was seeing figures between 4W~10W on Windows (sadly slightly more on Linux).In general this generation of Radeon GPUs seems highly efficient. Radeon 9070 is a beast of a GPU.replydontlaugh 2 hours ago

They benchmark so well that I’m considering replacing my 3070 with a 9070xt.replymakeitdouble 7 hours ago

To wager a guess, would that optimization also help push the envelope when one application needs all the power it can get while another monitor is just sitting idle ?Another angle I'm wondering about is longevity of the card. Not sure if AMD would positively care in the first place, but as a user if the card didn't have to grind much on the idle parts and thus last a year or two longer, it would be pretty valuable.replyformerly_proven 5 hours ago

Recent nvidia generations also about doubled their idle power consumption. Those increases are probably actual baseline increases (i.e. reduce compute power budget), while prior RDNA generations would idle at around 80-100 W doing video playback or driving more than one monitor, which is more indicative of problematic power management.replysjnonweb 4 hours ago

Power efficient chips will result in more overall performance for the same amount of total power drawn. Its all about performance/wattreplysylware 5 hours ago

Another pane of AMD GPU R&D is the _userland_ _hardware_ [ring] buffers for near direct hardware userland programming.They started to experiment on that in mesa and linux ("user queues", as "user hardware queues").I don't know how they will work around the scarse VM IDs, but here, we are talking near 0 driver. Obviously, they will have to simplify/cleanup a lot 3D pipeline programming and be very sure of its robustness, basically to have it ready for "default" rendering/usage right away.Userland will get from the kernel stuff along those lines: command/event hardware ring buffers, data dma buffers, read/write pointers & doorbells memory page for those ring buffers, and an event file descriptor for an event ring buffer. Basically, what the kernel currently has.I wonder if it will provide some significant simplification than the current way which is giving indirect command buffers to the kernel and deal with 'sync objects'/barriers.replyaverne_ 4 hours ago

The NVidia driver also has userland submission (in fact it does not support kernel-mode submission at all). I don't think it leads to a significant simplification or not of the userland code, basically a driver has to keep track of the same thing it would've submitted to an ioctl. If anything there are some subtleties that require careful consideration.The major upside is removing the context switch on a submission. The idea is that an application only talks to the kernel for queue setup/teardown, everything else happens in userland.replyformerly_proven 5 hours ago

In terms of heat output the difference between an idling gaming PC from 10 years ago (~30-40 W) and one today (100+ W) is very noticeable in a room. Besides, even gaming PCs are likely idle or nearly idle a significant amount of time, and that's just power wasted. There are also commercial users of desktop GPUs, and there they are idle an even bigger percentage of the time.replyDiabloD3 2 hours ago

Idling "gaming PCs" idle about 30-40w.Your monitor configuration has always controlled idle power of a GPU (for about the past 15 years), and you need to be aware of what is "too much" for your GPU.RDNA4 and Series 50 is anything more than the equivalent of a single 4k 120hz kicks it out of super-idle, and it sits at around ~75W.replydaneel_w 2 hours ago

> Idling "gaming PCs" idle about 30-40w.Hm, do they? I don't think any stationary PC I've had the past 15 years have idled that low. They have all had modest(ish) specs, and the setups were tuned for balanced power consumption rather than performance. My current one idles at 50-55W. There's a Ryzen 5 5600G and an Nvidia GTX 1650 in there. The rest of the components are unassuming in terms of wattage: a single NVMe SSD, a single 120mm fan running at half RPM, and 16 GiB of RAM (of course without RGB LED nonsense).replyDiabloD3 2 hours ago

Series 16 cards have weird idle problems. Mine also exhibited that. They're literally Series 20s with no RTX cores at all, and their identical 20 counterparts didn't seem to have the same issue.So, I assume its Nvidia incompetence. Its my first and last Nvidia card in years, AMD treats users better.replydaneel_w 56 minutes ago

Are the 10- and 40- series similar? Before the 1650 I had the 1060 in the same PC, and for a while I had an RTX 4060 in it as well (which I bailed on because the model emitted terrible coil noise). Neither really made any mentionable difference in idle power. I'm personally convinced that besides "NUCs" and running on only a 25-35W AMD APU with no discrete graphics card, the days of low-power stationary PCs are long over.replyDiabloD3 42 minutes ago

10 was probably the last truly inefficient, but you shouldn't be having problems with a 40.Shame you don't have it around anymore, because I'd say set your desktop to like, native res, 60hz, only have one monitor installed, 8 bit SDR not 10 bit SDR, and see if the power usage goes away.Like, on a 9800x3D /w 7900XTX with my 4th monitor unplugged (to get under the maximum super-idle load for the GPU), I'm sub-50W idle.replyadgjlsfhk1 8 hours ago

the architecture is shared between desktop and mobile. this sounds 100% like something that they did to give some dual display laptop or handheld 3 hours extra battery life by fixing something dumb.replysyntaxing 12 hours ago

More curious, does RDNA4 have native FP8 support?replykrasin 12 hours ago
| parent [–]
I refer to the RDNA4 instruction set manual ([1]), page 90, Table 41. WMMA Instructions.They support FP8/BF8 with F32 accumulate and also IU4 with I32 accumulate. The max matrix size is 16x16. For comparison, NVIDIA Blackwell GB200 supports matrices up to 256x32 for FP8 and 256x96 for NVFP4.This matters for overall throughput, as feeding a bigger matrix unit is actually cheaper in terms of memory bandwidth, as the number of FLOPs grows O(n^2) when increasing the size of a systolic array, while the number of inputs/outputs as O(n).1. https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/radeon-tech...2. https://semianalysis.com/2025/06/23/nvidia-tensor-core-evolu...replyatq2119 1 hour ago

It's misleading to compare a desktop GPU against a data center GPU on these metrics. Blackwell data center tenor cores are different from Blackwell consumer tensor cores, and same for the AMD side.Also, the size of the native / atomic matrix fragment size isn't relevant for memory bandwidth because you can always build larger matrices out of multiple fragments in the register file. A single matrix fragment is read from memory once and used in multiple matmul instructions, which has the same effect on memory bandwidth as using a single larger matmul instruction.reply
