Is anyone using Observable for something?In theory sounds good, I like the demos, but never actually saw anyone actually using it.We use Marimo notebooks as a great improvement over Jupyter.replyetra0 1 hour ago

I've used it for fun to analyze some data of some community in real time without having to host anything on my side.Doing data analysis in javascript feels a bit weird at first, but it allows you to write a bit more functional code than python which I ended up liking.I dislike the plotting api but the pro of being automatically updated without me needing to do/host anything is cool.replyjeffbee 6 minutes ago

I use it regularly to make articles, reports, and especially maps for local decision makers. You'd be surprised, terrified to learn how little the elected officials know about their cities.replytremarley 1 hour ago

This website seems to be broken. The page is full grey, until we scroll down to half way down the page.replymichaelterryio 4 hours ago

How does this fit with Framework? Is Framework still part of the plans?replydleeftink 4 hours ago

Based on mb's response [0], it seems existing Framework features are being refitted to the new notebook format.[0]: https://github.com/observablehq/framework/discussions/2022replythomastjeffery 2 hours ago

IDK why people keep making apps that are 99% web stack, but only run on mac... Maybe it's a good thing I can't waste my time on your tech.replymjoin 1 hour ago

It's possible to make (via polyglot JS/HTML files[1]) apps that offer both a command-line interface that can be invoked with NodeJS (or other JS-ish runtime) or can be opened in the browser (via double-click, the browser's File Open dialog, or by just typing the file path into the location bar) if the right version of NodeJS isn't available (or for people who just don't want to give carte blanche to run outside the safety of the browser sandbox to programs downloaded from the internet, given the poor track record of NPM-based program creators/maintainers to stay on top of their dependencies).A ton more programs, especially one-shot programs that operate on a single batch input (e.g. a directory of files) and then generate some output—like a ZIP copy of the files for your static site—should offer this but unfortunately don't.
At best they'll put out an Electron app for cross-platform compatibility, but it doesn't sidestep the problem of granting overbroad capabilities to NPM modules (or the massive memory footprint).
Then, in this case, there's Observable Desktop, which as a Mac-only app, falls short even of that mark.1. <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44229684>replydwmbt 1 hour ago

i believe they're referring to the observable desktop[0] macos app, a gui client for notebook kit[1]. the cli works great, fwiw![0]: https://observablehq.com/notebook-kit/kit)
