Brett McCracken
The Gospel Coalition
If you have kids, take them to see The Light of the World. It’s a worthy and edifying cinematic experience—especially compared to the alternatives in pop culture today.

Luke Y. Thompson
Mortal Cinema (Substack)
The problem is that Light of the World isn't much of a movie – it's a biblical tract for kids that makes sure characters always say their names out loud and repeat key scriptural points

AMFM Magazine
While the story of Jesus has been told in many ways over the years with varying degrees of quality, this does the story justice with top-tier animation with its heart in the right place.
Rated: 9/10

Sunshine State Cineplex
The gorgeous animation alone is worth diving into this version, even if the story is fairly traditional.
Rated: 6/10

KGET-TV (Bakersfield, CA)
Despite the fact this production is hand-drawn 2D animation, every character has more depth than a lot of the live-action versions.
Rated: B

Incredibly accurate, the movie captures your heart and is easy to understand. Very accurate biblically, very descriptive and biblically accurate movie. Grown men were crying in the theatre, as this movie touched the hearts and souls of everyone in the theatre. You must go see this movie!
