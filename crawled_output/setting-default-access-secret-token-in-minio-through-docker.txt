spent all afternoon with ChatGPT and couldn't figure this out, hope someone can help me here.
Using Minio in a Docker Stack for local development, everything works fine.
Would love to, though, start it up with:
a default access_key/secret_key (coming from my .env file)
a bucket already created ("screenshots")
Is there an easy way to do that?
Thank you
minio:

environment:

MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD}
MINIO_ROOT_USER_FILE: ""
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE: ""
volumes:
