spent all afternoon with ChatGPT and couldn't figure this out, hope someone can help me here.
Using Minio in a Docker Stack for local development, everything works fine.
Would love to, though, start it up with:
a default access_key/secret_key (coming from my .env file)
a bucket already created ("screenshots")
Is there an easy way to do that?
Thank you
minio:
image: quay.io/minio/minio
container_name: pertento_minio
command: server /data --console-address ":${MINIO_WEB_PORT}" --address ":${MINIO_API_PORT}"
environment:
MINIO_ROOT_USER: ${MINIO_ROOT_USER}
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD}
MINIO_ROOT_USER_FILE: ""
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE: ""
volumes:
- minio_config:/root/.minio
- minio_data:/data
ports:
- '${MINIO_WEB_PORT}:${MINIO_WEB_PORT}'
- '${MINIO_API_PORT}:${MINIO_API_PORT}'
networks:
