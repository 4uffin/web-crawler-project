Fans have been calling BBC Radio Sheffield to reflect on Sheffield United's 5-0 defeat at Ipswich Town:Ben: Getting rid of Wilder was just baffling. The players have no fight. They just gave up after the second and third goal. Darren: I can guarantee you that is [Ruben Selles'] last game. I do not understand why he picked Tom Cannon tonight.Kane: It's an absolute joke. It's unbelievable. Selles should try and change formation.

Ipswich skipper Dara O'Shea has been speaking to Sky Sports. Here's what he had to say:"You saw tonight but we see it every day in training it is frightening what he (Jaden Philogene) can do with the ball. I'm really happy for him"It's been a long time since we won a game here so it was important to set the tone. Really happy to be back here."We're only finding ourselves still and we're all pushing to play. Day in and day out we've got to keep our standards high. The sky is the limit for us."

Jaden Philogene as an individual needed that hat-trick.He hasn't had the smoothest of paths since he has been at Ipswich. Tonight was perfect for him.Down the left, Ipswich were absolutely superb and that has won them the game.Leif Davis has shown incredible willingness from left-back. He did some wonderful work, but Philogene has got to put the ball in the back of the net.

The fact that ipswich Town have been able to get in these positions as easily and as cheaply as they have is the problem.Sheffield United's Michael Cooper, I believe is a Premier League goalkeeper-in-waiting, but even he isn't a miracle worker.
