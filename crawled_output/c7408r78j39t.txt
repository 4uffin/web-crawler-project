The Blades have a shot on target!Their first in this match and first in quite some time.Bright play from Sydie Peck and Tom Cannon takes a touch and takes the shot on early.Alex Palmer is alert at his near post.

It's been a long time since Ipswich beat Chelsea at Portman Road in their last home league win [on 30 December 2024].They also beat Bristol Rovers just after the turn of the year [in the FA Cup 3rd Round].

Image source, Rex FeaturesThe Blades are 2-0 down - cue the 'sacked in the morning' chants from the away fans and to make it worse the Ipswich supporters are joining in now.More poor defending from Sheffield United as they let Jaden Philogene drift across the edge of the area without a single challenge. He is naturally right-footed but plays on the left so why, with that information did the visitors' defence allow him to cut inside...again?Four away substitutes have been sent out to warm up.

First booking of the night goes to Blades debutant Mark McGuinness.He catches the heels of Chuba Akpom on halfway and the referee gives him a yellow card for that.

Sheffield Utd dominant in passing the ball around the final third, just not actually doing anything with it. Bizarre.Ceiron, Beds.Sheffield United have been taken over by clueless owners who have replaced a serial winner with a clueless manager with a track record of rank mediocrity. They have sucked any semblance of optimism out of the club and have us on a catastrophic trajectory.Chris in Sale.Don't sit on the fence, Chris...

ALMOST a shot on target for the away side.Sydie Peck does well to shovel a pass into the feet of Callum O'Hare just outside the area and the ex-Coventry man goes for goal but snatches at it and it dribbles a few feet wide.

I would be fascinated to have been a fly on the wall for that Ruben Selles team talk at half-time.Sheffield United just need a spark from somewhere - a firelight from underneath them.At the minute, I'm not seeing exactly how they are going to test Ipswich keeper Alex Palmer.

Ipswich deservedly in front and more problems for Ruben Selles.These are two sides very comfortable in possession - the trouble for Sheffield United is when they lose the ball they are all over the place with no shape and within a couple of passes Ipswich are bearing down on their goal.I spent a fair bit of the half watching the Blades boss and for the first half an hour he was on the edge of his technical area urging his side on and giving plenty of positive vibes.For the last five minutes of the first period he was sat down in deep conversation with his coaching staff.He must now find an answer while for Ipswich they must feel there are more goals in this.

No shots on target this season. When they sacked Wilder it was for attacking football.RichHas a manager ever been sacked at half time in the Championship? Is Chris Wilder anywhere nearby for the second half?AnonDon't forget your names on messages, folks...

Following Danny Hall's question, Sheffield United's last shot on target was during their 1-0 defeat at home by Millwall on 23 August.They haven't had one on target in their last two games including tonight.They have had four shots on target in four matches including this evening.

You can see how Sheffield United are trying to go about things.It's not quite working. I can't quite see what it is supposed to be.Alex Palmer hasn't had a save to make in the Ipswich goal.What is the last shot on target that Sheffield United had? The fact that we are talking about that is concerning
