These Bras And Tees Could Be The AnswerBy helping your posture, these clothes and bras can help relieve back pain, too.By Haley ZovickianStaff Writer, HuffPostAug 30, 2025, 07:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENT“If you’ve spent a lot of time with bad posture[,] it can be hard to have a good sense of what correct posture feels like,” explained Liza Egbogah, a chiropractor, osteopath and myofascial release specialist, in previous HuffPost coverage.That’s why posture-supporting clothing can be especially helpful, according to Egbogah. “Posture sports bras and tees help to reinforce good posture,” Egbogah noted. “As you wear posture-friendly apparel, your muscles and fascia will adapt to support you correctly.”While posture-boosting apparel can’t take the place of checkups with your doctor or targeted medical support, these products can help your body and muscle memory get in the habit of a more aligned stance.Advertisement

5AmazonOr an expert-recommended posture-supporting shirtEgbogah recommended these posture shirts from AlignMed in previous HuffPost reporting. Available in men's and women's sizing, they're designed to work as a wearable therapy that activates and retrains muscles as you wear them."I didn't really want to pay this much, but it's worth every penny," wrote one Amazon reviewer. "This shirt makes me feel good. I have chronic muscle tightness in my back and find this to be a major pain reliever. Who knew my posture was the problem? I ordered just a bit smaller than I expected based on the guidelines that suggested the snugger the better. The tightness is the reason it works so well on my sore back. Don't order too large."If you're between sizes, AlignMed recommends sizing down.
