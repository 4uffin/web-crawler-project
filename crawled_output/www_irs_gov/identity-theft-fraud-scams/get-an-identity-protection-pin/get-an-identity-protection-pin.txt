Taxpayer identification numbers (TIN)
An identity protection PIN (IP PIN) is a six-digit number that prevents someone else from filing a tax return using your Social Security number (SSN) or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). The IP PIN is known only to you and the IRS. It helps us verify your identity when you file your electronic or paper tax return. Even though you may not have a filing requirement, an IP PIN still protects your account.
If you are a confirmed victim of tax-related identity theft and we have resolved your tax account issues, we’ll mail you a CP01A Notice with your new IP PIN each year.
If you don't already have an IP PIN, you may get an IP PIN as a proactive step to protect yourself from tax-related identity theft. Anyone with an SSN or an ITIN can get an IP PIN including individuals living abroad.
How to get an IP PIN
The fastest way to receive an IP PIN is to request one through your Online Account, under your “Profile” page. If you don’t already have an account on IRS.gov, you must register to validate your identity.
Spouses and dependents are eligible for an IP PIN if they can pass the identity verification process.
Once you have opted in and obtained an IP PIN online, you will need to retrieve your IP PIN online each calendar year as a CP01A Notice will not be mailed.
The IP PIN is generally available in your online account starting in mid-January through mid-November. Select the button to get started.

Alternatives to online enrollment
If you want an IP PIN but can’t successfully establish an online account, there are alternatives. Please note using an alternative method to the online account takes longer for an IP PIN to be assigned to you.
Filing an application for an IP PIN
If your adjusted gross income on your last filed return is below $84,000 for Individuals or $168,000 for married filing joint and you can’t establish an online account, you can submit Form 15227, Application for an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number online. You must have:
A valid Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number.
An adjusted gross income on your last filed return is below $84,000 for Individuals or $168,000 for married filing joint.
Access to a telephone
We will use the telephone number provided on the Form 15227 to call you and validate your identity. Once we verify your identity, you will receive your IP PIN via the U.S. Postal Service usually within four to six weeks. You will then receive your IP PIN annually through the mail.
Requesting in-person authentication for an IP PIN
If you’re unable to verify your identity online or with the Form 15227 process or you are ineligible to file Form 15227, you may make an appointment for an in-person meeting at a local Taxpayer Assistance Center. Please bring one current government-issued picture identification document and another identification document to prove your identity. Once we verify your identity, you will receive your IP PIN via the U.S. Postal Service usually within three weeks. You will then receive your IP PIN annually through the mail.
Important information about IP PINs
An IP PIN is valid for one calendar year.
A new IP PIN is generated each year for your account.
Logging back into your online account, will display your current IP PIN through the Profile Tab.
An IP PIN must be used when filing any federal tax returns during the year including prior year returns.
See FAQs about the identity protection personal identification number (IP PIN)
Using an IP PIN to file
Enter the six-digit IP PIN when prompted by your tax software product or provide it to your trusted tax professional preparing your tax return. The IP PIN is used only on Forms 1040, 1040-NR, 1040-PR, 1040-SR, and 1040-SS.
Correct IP PINs must be entered on electronic and paper tax returns to avoid rejections and delays. An incorrect or missing IP PIN will result in the rejection of your e-filed return or a delay of your paper return until it can be verified.
Don’t reveal your IP PIN to anyone. It should be known only to your tax professional and only when you are ready to sign and submit your return. The IRS will never ask for your IP PIN. Phone calls, emails or texts asking for your IP PIN are scams.
Lost IP PINs
Review Retrieve your IP PIN for details. Do not file a Form 15227 to apply for a new IP PIN.
