How to file an amended return
To amend a return, file Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. You can use tax software to electronically file your 1040-X online.
Submit all the same forms and schedules as you did when you filed your original Form 1040 even if you don't have adjustments on them.
File Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization with your 1040-X.
You can file up to 3 amended returns for the same year.
File on paper if you're amending a return:
You filed on paper for a previous year in the current.
Example: You filed your original return on paper for tax year 2023 in February 2025 and need to amend the return.
For tax years 2021 and prior.
Get your refund on your amended return
If you amend a return for tax years 2021 and later, you can request your refund by direct deposit. Enter your bank account information on the electronically filed Form 1040-X or corrected Form 1040-SS/PR. If you submitted a paper version of Form 1040-X, you'll receive a paper check.
You can also attach Form 8888, Allocation of Refund (Including Savings Bond Purchases) PDF to deposit your refund to multiple bank accounts. You can't use refunds from amended returns to buy savings bonds.
If you owe tax
Mail a check or money order payable to United States Treasury with Form 1040-V, Payment Voucher PDF. If you owe additional tax, file your amended return, and pay the tax by the April due date to avoid penalties and interest. Your return will replace your original return. If you file after the April due date, don't include any interest or penalties on your amended return. We'll make any needed adjustments automatically.
State tax returns
If you change your federal return, it may affect your state tax liability. For information on how to correct your state tax return, contact your state tax agency. Don't attach your state tax return to your amended return.
