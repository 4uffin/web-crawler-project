If you need more time to file your taxes, request an extension by the April tax filing due date. This gives you until October 15 to file without penalties. Make sure you pay any tax you owe by the April filing date. The extension is only for filing your return.
Get an extension
There are 3 ways to get until October 15 to file your tax return.
Pay online and check the box
Pay what you owe using an online payment option and check the box that you are paying as part of filing for an extension. You don’t have to file a separate extension form and you’ll receive a confirmation number of your extension for your records.
Use Free File (no income limit for extensions)
Use IRS Free File to electronically request an automatic tax-filing extension.
Request an extension by mail
File Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. You can file by mail, online with an IRS e-filing partner or through a tax professional.
Estimate how much tax you owe for the year on the extension form: Subtract the taxes you already paid for the filing year.
If you’re outside the U.S.
You may get an automatic 2-month extension if you’re a U.S. citizen or resident alien and on the regular due date of your tax return, you’re living out of the country.
If a disaster affected you
You may have more time to file if you were affected by a disaster situation.
