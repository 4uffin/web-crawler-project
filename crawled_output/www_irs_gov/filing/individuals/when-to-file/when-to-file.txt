Calendar year filers (most common)
File on: April 15, 2025
Fiscal year filers
File on: The fourth month after your fiscal year ends, day 15.
If day 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the due date is delayed until the next business day. Your return is considered filed on time if your envelope is properly addressed, postmarked and deposited in the mail by the due date.
See Publication 509, Tax Calendars for information on:
tax filing deadlines
filing, paying and other tax action due dates
Need more time?
If you can't file by the due date of your return, you can request an automatic 6-month extension of time to file. Please be aware that:
An extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay.
You must file Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return by the original due date of your return.
You should pay any owed taxes by your original due date to avoid possible penalties.
Haven't filed your tax return lately?
If you haven't filed your federal income tax return for this year or for prior years, you should file your return as soon as possible. See what to do if you haven't filed your tax return.
Members of the military
Special rules may apply if you served or are serving in the Armed Forces in a combat zone or a contingency operation or become hospitalized from an injury while serving.
You have at least 180 days after you leave the designated combat zone/contingency operation to file and pay taxes.
If the Service determines that you're affected by a presidentially declared disaster or a terroristic or military action, you may have up to one year after the due date of your return to file and pay taxes, depending on the deadline specified by the Service.
Taxpayers, including civilians working with the Department of Defense, must notify the IRS directly of their status for qualifying combat zone relief. For more information, see Notifying the IRS by email about Combat Zone Service.
