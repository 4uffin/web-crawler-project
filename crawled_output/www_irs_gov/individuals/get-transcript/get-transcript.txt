For more information, visit our Transcripts services for individuals - FAQs. If you're trying to get a transcript to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), refer to Tax information for student financial aid applications.
Note: Transcripts partially mask your personally identifiable information to protect you. Financial data will remain fully visible to allow for tax preparation, tax representation or income verification. Learn more at About tax transcripts. If you need a photocopy of your return, submit Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return.
Caution: The IRS doesn’t initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages or social media channels to request personal or financial information. Visit Report phishing for instructions if you're unsure about the authenticity of any unsolicited communication you receive, other than U.S. mail, claiming to be from the IRS.
