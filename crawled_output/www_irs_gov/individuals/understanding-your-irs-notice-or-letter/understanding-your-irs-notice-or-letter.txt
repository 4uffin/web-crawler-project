If you receive an IRS notice or letter
We may send you a notice or letter if:
You have a balance due
Your refund has changed
We have a question about your return
We need to verify your identity
We changed or corrected your return
We’re delayed in processing your return
To get details on an IRS notice or letter, search for it by number or topic. You can find the CP or LTR number on the right corner of the letter.
What to do if you get a letter or notice
Review it carefully and keep it for your records. If we ask you to respond, act by the due date. What to do depends on your situation:
If you agree with the notice or letter
Take any requested action. You don’t need to reply unless we specifically ask you to.
If you disagree
Follow the instructions in the notice to dispute what it says. Include information and copies of documents for us to review when we consider your dispute.
To guarantee your appeal rights, reply by the due date.
If you have an amount due
Even if you can’t pay the full amount you owe, pay by the due date. This can reduce interest and penalty charges.
If we changed or corrected your tax return
Compare the information in the notice or letter with your return. If you agree, note the corrections on your personal copy of the tax return and keep it for your records.
You only need to take action if we ask for more information, if you have a balance due or if you disagree with the notice.
If you suspect a scam
If the letter doesn’t appear in your search or if it looks suspicious, call 800-829-1040. Follow the IRS representative’s instructions.
Scams and consumer alerts
