The Estimator is not yet updated to reflect the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions
Consider reviewing your withholding manually or consulting a tax professional if you:
Have income from tips or overtime
Paid interest on a loan for a new car
Paid more than $10,000 in State and local taxes
Are age 65 or older
In these cases, using the Estimator may result in more tax withheld from your paycheck than needed. This may lead to a refund or smaller balance due when you file.
If you don’t have a Social Security number valid for work (and your spouse doesn’t, if married filing jointly): You may no longer be eligible for certain credits including the Child Tax Credit. In this case, using the Estimator may result in less tax withheld from your paycheck. This may lead to a smaller refund or larger balance due when you file.

After you use the estimator
Use your estimate to change your tax withholding amount on Form W-4. Or keep the same amount.
To change your tax withholding amount:
Enter your new tax withholding amount on Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Certificate
Ask your employer if they use an automated system to submit Form W-4
Submit or give Form W-4 to your employer
To keep your same tax withholding amount:
You don't need to do anything at this time.
Check your withholding again when needed and each year with the Estimator. This helps you make sure the amount withheld works for your circumstance.
When to check your withholding
Check your tax withholding every year, especially:
When you have a major life change
New job or other paid work
Major income change
Marriage
Child birth or adoption
Home purchase
If you changed your tax withholding mid-year
Check your tax withholding at year-end, and adjust as needed with a new W-4
If you have more questions about your withholding, ask your employer or tax advisor.
Why check your withholding
There are several reasons to check your withholding:
It can protect against having too little tax withheld and facing an unexpected tax bill or penalty at tax time next year.
It can let you adjust your tax withheld up front, so you receive a bigger paycheck and smaller refund at tax time.
Security
The Tax Withholding Estimator doesn't ask for personal information such as your name, social security number, address or bank account numbers.
We don't save or record the information you enter in the estimator.
