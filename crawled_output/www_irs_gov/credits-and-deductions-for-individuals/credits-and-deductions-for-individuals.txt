How they work
You can claim credits and deductions when you file your tax return to lower your tax. Make sure you get all the credits and deductions you qualify for. If you have qualified dependents, you may be eligible for certain credits and deductions.
Claim credits
A credit is an amount you subtract from the tax you owe. This can lower your tax payment or increase your refund. Some credits are refundable — they can give you money back even if you don't owe any tax.
To claim credits, answer questions in your tax filing software. If you file a paper return, you’ll need to complete a form and attach it.
Here are credits you can claim:
If you earn under a certain income level
See if you qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit. This is a refundable credit, so you can get back more than you pay in taxes. If you qualify, you can claim it even if you don’t normally file taxes or aren’t required to file.
If you’re a parent or caretaker
Find credits if you:
Have children or other dependents
Adopt a child
Pay for childcare or dependent care
If you pay for higher education
See if you qualify for an education credit
If you put money into retirement savings
See if you qualify for the saver’s credit
If you invest in clean vehicles or clean home energy
Find credits if you:
Buy a clean (electric or hybrid) vehicle
Make home energy improvements
If you buy health insurance in the marketplace
See if you qualify for the Premium Tax Credit. Learn how to correct your rejected e-filed return for a missing Form 8962.
If you qualify for other personal tax credits
Find less common credits for people who:
Paid taxes overseas
Overpaid Social Security or RRTA tax
Paid alternative minimum tax in prior years
Paid tax on undistributed capital gains
Take deductions
A deduction is an amount you subtract from your income when you file so you don’t pay tax on it. By lowering your income, deductions lower your tax.
You need documents to show expenses or losses you want to deduct. Your tax software will calculate deductions for you and enter them in the right forms. If you file a paper return, your deductions go on Form 1040 and may require extra forms.
Standard vs. itemized deductions
Most people take the standard deduction, which lets you subtract a set amount from your income based on your filing status.
If your deductible expenses and losses are more than the standard deduction, you can save money by deducting them one-by-one from your income (itemizing). Tax software can walk you through your expenses and losses to show the option that gives you the lowest tax.
Some people, including nonresidents and partial-year filers, can’t take the standard deduction.
Standard deduction amounts
The standard deduction for 2024 is:
$14,600 for single or married filing separately
$29,200 for married couples filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse
$21,900 for head of household
Find the standard deduction if you’re:
Over 65 or blind
A dependent on someone else’s tax return
If you’re married filing separately, you can’t take the standard deduction if your spouse itemizes. You must both choose the same method.
Deductible expenses
You can deduct these expenses whether you take the standard deduction or itemize:
Alimony payments
Business use of your car
Business use of your home
Money you put in an IRA
Money you put in health savings accounts
Penalties on early withdrawals from savings
Student loan interest
Teacher expenses
For some military, government, self-employed and people with disabilities: work-related education expenses
For military servicemembers: moving expenses
If you itemize, you can deduct these expenses:
Bad debts
Canceled debt on home
Capital losses
Donations to charity
Gains from sale of your home
Gambling losses
Home mortgage interest
Income, sales, real estate and personal property taxes
Losses from disasters and theft
Medical and dental expenses over 7.5% of your adjusted gross income
Miscellaneous itemized deductions
Opportunity zone investment
