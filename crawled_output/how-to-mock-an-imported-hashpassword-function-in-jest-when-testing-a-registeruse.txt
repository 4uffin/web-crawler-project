How to mock an imported hashPassword function in Jest when testing a registerUser method?

Question
I have a registerUser method that imports a hashPassword function from a local utility module.
// registerUser.ts
import { User } from "../models/user.model";
import { hashPassword } from "../utils/hash";
export async function registerUser(data: RegisterInput) {
const exists = await User.findOne({ email: data.email });
if (exists) return { error: "Email already exists", status: 409 } as const;
const passwordHash = await hashPassword(data.password);
const user = await User.create({
username: data.username.trim(),
email: data.email,
password: passwordHash,
});
await user.save();
return { status: 201, id: user._id };
}
Problem
I’m trying to test the happy path (new user registration).
In the test, I want to mock hashPassword so it doesn’t run the real hashing function.
Here’s my Jest test:
import { registerUser } from "../services/registerUser";
import { User } from "../models/user.model";
import { hashPassword } from "../utils/hash";
describe("registerUser", () => {
it("should register a new user", async () => {
jest.spyOn(User, "findOne").mockResolvedValue(null);
jest.spyOn(User, "create").mockResolvedValue({ _id: "123", save: jest.fn() });
// ❌ This mock does not seem to work
jest.spyOn(hashPassword, "mockResolvedValue").mockResolvedValue("fakehash");
const result = await registerUser({
username: "TestUser",
email: "[email protected]",
password: "StrongPassword",
});
expect(result).toEqual({ status: 201, id: "123" });
});
});
Error:
FAIL
tests/service/auth.service.test.ts
● Test suite failed to run
TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'hashPassword' of object '[object Module]'

Why is the second argument to your spy function "mockResolvedValue"? Shouldn't it follow the same syntax as above with user?

It looks like you're spying on a method that isn't actually implemented. You have spy(hashPassword, "thisThingEitherDoesntExistOrDoesntReferenceAnything"
See How to spy on a class constructor jest? (or look for mocking in jest)
An alternative to consider in these instances is if the juice is worth the squeeze. You don't need to mock the hash password function to test the functionality of registering a user. Since you're using a library function (hashPassword), you may assume the developers have already tested it, and it's underlying implementation is WAI. So you can just assert that once registerUser is done, you have *something* in the password field/db/model.
The mock is doing precisely the concept above - pretending the functionality of your dependency (hashpass) is WAI, so that you can test the functionality of registerUser without worrying if hashPassword works.
As an aside - If looking up jest constructor mocking leads you to have to add a workaround into your production code (registerUser), you'd be deliberately adding code for no reasonable test benefit (because the implementation of hashPassword doesn't matter, mocking it would just give you whatever you told it to), so the tradeoff (of adding additional code) wouldn't be worth it.
