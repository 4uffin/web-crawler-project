We also expect to hear some updates on Meta’s machine intelligence efforts, and maybe a hint or two about how things are going at the company’s fledgling AI superintelligence lab.You can watch the video of the Meta Connect livestream from Meta’s Horizon site or on the Meta for developers Facebook page. Unlike Apple or Google, Meta doesn’t stream its conference keynote on YouTube.If you’re all in on the virtual reality future, you can also watch the event on a Meta Quest headset by going into the Horizon page and selecting the VR viewing option.If you’re a developer and want to register for Connect, you can do that by plugging your name and email into the Meta Connect website. In the upper-right corner, look for a button that reads “Register for the livestream.” Enter your information and you’ll get information about additional presentations and developer sessions.What to ExpectWhile there may be some surprises at the event, Meta did fumble its reveal earlier this week when it accidentally leaked images of some new glasses that seem queued up to be announced at Connect. The leaked image includes the word Display, which could hint that Meta is looking to put out a new pair of glasses with an actual display built into the lenses.The company showed off its ambitions for such a wearable device at its Connect event last year when it debuted its prototype Orion frames, which relied on a wristband for navigation and a wireless puck for connectivity and computing power. The design of last year’s frames used waveguide technology to create virtual displays of images, text, and videos that appear in the wearer’s vision. Developers have had access to Orion frames for a year, so the technology is likely ready for its next step.We’re also expecting new models of the smart glasses developed by Meta and its main brand partners, Ray-Ban and Oakley.Tune in at 5 pm Pacific on Wednesday for more coverage of Meta Connect 2025 as it happens live.CommentsBack to topTriangleYou Might Also Like …In your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining storiesThe unexpected winners of Trump’s trade warBig Story: The end of handwritingThe dark money group secretly funding Democratic influencersSpecial Edition: Are we healthy yet?Boone Ashworth is a staff writer on the WIRED Gear desk, where he writes about connected hardware, sustainability, and the right to repair.
