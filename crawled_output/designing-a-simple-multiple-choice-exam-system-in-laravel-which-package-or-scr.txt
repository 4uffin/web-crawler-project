I want to build a simple online exam system with Laravel.
My requirements are not very complex, basically:
Create exams
Add multiple-choice questions
Store user answers and calculate the score
I don’t need advanced features like detailed reports, multiple user roles, or timed exams.
My question is:
Are there any existing packages or scripts in the Laravel ecosystem that would be a good fit for this?
Or is it better to build such a system from scratch?
Thanks in advance!
I searched on GitHub and Packagist for Laravel exam or quiz packages. I found a few projects, but most of them were either outdated or had too many features for my simple use case.
I was expecting to find a lightweight and actively maintained package that allows creating multiple-choice exams easily.
