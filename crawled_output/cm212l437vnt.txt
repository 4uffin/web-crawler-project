Canada working superbly well. What a response. Sophie de Goede taking the ball right to the middle.

Great response from Canada. Sophie de Goede drives them forward initially, and then it's the turn of the forwards as DaLeaka Menin bulldozes over.Hang on. TMO is checking it.

Canada break the line. They're eventually slowed down about five metres out.

Game on, isn't it?! She had really good footwork. When you have the pace of Miller there, no one is going to stop her.

Australia have the ball in the middle of the park, but they're not getting forward with it.

Canada are playing on those edges testing the Australian defence.

A reminder, Australia have never beaten Canada in seven outings. They completely switched off there and were punished.It was the complete opposite to their super switched-on start against England last time out.Image source, Getty Images

What a start! Canada burst into the lead as the Maple Leafs switch the ball to the left wing about 30 metres out where Asia Hogan-Rochester has acres of room in front of her and once she gets running, nobody can catch her.It's an easy cross to score.

Calm stuff from Canada early on, walking the ball up the field before forcing an Australia error to win a line-out.

There were still plenty of empty seats 15 minutes before kick-off at Ashton Gate, but considering the match is being staged in a 27,000-seater venue without any home nations teams, I think you can allow it not being full to the brim.A reminder that it was only a few years ago that England's record crowd was short of 5,000.This will be comfortably more than that.
