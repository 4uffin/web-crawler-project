Science, Health, and Public Trust
Image
This section of the NIH website provides tools to help improve the quality and usefulness of information for the public about science and health. We serve many audiences at NIH and our grantee institutions across the country: scientists, health professionals, reporters, communicators, health educators, patients, caregivers, and the general public. Our goal as communicators is to contribute to public understanding of the nature of biomedical research and its role in health.
Please feel free to email the NIH Science, Health and Public Trust Communications working group with your thoughts and suggestions.
