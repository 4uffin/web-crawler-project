Frequently Asked Questions
Frequently Asked Questions
Can’t find an answer to your question? Contact us via our Ask NIH online form.
Health Information
Health conditions — Where can I find information about a specific disease?
The NIH Health Information page provides access to Institute and Center resources based on scientific investigation.
Health information on the Internet — Can NIH offer any advice when searching for health information on the Internet?
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has no official role in policing the quality of health information found on the Internet. Nevertheless, we can offer some advice.
Web information should not be used as an alternative to seeking professional medical help. Don't use the information you find to make a self-diagnosis.
Don't use information found on the Web for self-treatment, especially in cases of serious illness.
Use the information you find to become an informed patient. Discuss what you have learned with your medical care providers.
When reviewing information you have uncovered, look for dates — how old is the information?
Be a critical consumer, ask questions: Has this document been updated? Is there a point-of-contact for the information? Are there any references? Has the information been peer reviewed (critically examined by credentialed professionals)?
Remember that the distinction between a paid ad and public service announcements may not be obvious on the Web.
Federal, State and even local government often provide health information. Look at the domain name of the site you have found — sites ending in GOV and ORG generally reflect Federal or State sources or non profit organizations.
Be particularly cautious when you see claims that a product: cures a wide range of ills, promises a quick fix, or seems too good to be true.
Health and Science Information from NIH — How does NIH tell the public about the science and health information its research uncovers?
As a public agency, NIH is committed to ensuring that accurate information reaches the diverse American public. How NIH Brings Health and Science to the Public explains how NIH communicates science and health information to patients, families, scientists, industry, teachers and students, health professionals, and the press.
Medical advice — Does the NIH provide advice about specific medical conditions?

About NIH
Mission — What is the National Institutes of Health?
Founded in 1887, the National Institutes of Health today is one of the world's foremost medical research centers, and the Federal focal point for medical research in the United States. The NIH, comprising 27 separate Institutes and Centers, is one of eight health agencies of the Public Health Service which, in turn, is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Simply described, the goal of NIH research is to acquire new knowledge to help prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat disease and disability, from the rarest genetic disorder to the common cold. The NIH mission is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. NIH works toward that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of medical and health sciences information.

In addition, the word mark NIH…Turning Discovery Into Health® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Another item restricted in its use is the NIH logo. The NIH logo is designed to signify official NIH products, activities, events, representatives, and facilities. It should never be used to promote or suggest endorsement of non-NIH products, events, or services. It should never be used by outside parties to misrepresent the purpose, character, policies, or mission of our agency.
Also, some materials that can be ordered from our site are subject to cost-recovery fee; however, in most cases, a single copy of any NIH publication can be ordered for free.
While you can reuse content found on our site, please note that many of our on-line health publications are continually updated as we learn more about that specific disease or condition. Occasionally, sites that copy and re-post our materials fail to check for updates, which results in out-of-date information being offered to users. For that reason, we urge you to link to our resource documents rather than re-posting. If you do re-post, please check back periodically to see if there are revisions.

Links from NIH — Will the NIH link to my website?
As a Federal agency, NIH cannot endorse or promote commercial or individual interests or services. This includes adding links and logos from non-NIH entities. In some cases, where the information serves the public good and is consistent with our mission, we may include an outside link to an external resource; however, these need to be examined on a case-by-case basis. In general, the web developer of each particular site determines when links to outside entities are justified.
