Lasker Clinical Research Scholars
An Historic Intramural-Extramural Partnership to Nurture the Next Generation of Clinical Researchers
Image
Bird's eye view of the NIH Clinical Research Center.
The National Institutes of Health, the nation’s premier agency for biomedical and behavioral research, in partnership with the Lasker Foundation, is pleased to announce the Lasker Clinical Research Scholars Program, an historic “intramural-extramural” partnership to nurture the next generation of clinical researchers.
The program supports a small number of exceptional clinical researchers in the early stages of their careers to promote their development to fully independent positions. Successful candidates are designated as Lasker Clinical Research Scholars.
Lasker Scholars receive a unique combination of NIH funding for clinical research for up to 10 years. In the first phase of the program, Scholars will receive appointments for 5-7 years as tenure-track investigators within the NIH Intramural Research Program with independent budgets. In the second phase, successful Scholars will receive up to 3 years of NIH support for their research at an extramural research facility; or the Scholar can be considered to remain as an investigator within the intramural program.
Lasker Scholars will have access to the NIH Clinical Center, the nation's largest hospital devoted entirely to clinical research. Through an arrangement with the Lasker Foundation, Scholars will have the opportunity to participate in selected activities, including attendance at the Lasker Breakfast and Award Luncheon, and participation in annual scientific meetings.
The program honors the contributions of Mary and Albert Lasker to the NIH and to the overall biomedical community.
