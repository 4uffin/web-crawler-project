Master your path
To become an expert in machine learning, you first need a strong foundation in four learning areas: coding, math, ML theory, and how to build your own ML project from start to finish.
Begin with TensorFlow's curated curriculums to improve these four skills, or choose your own learning path by exploring our resource library below.
The four areas of machine learning education
When beginning your educational path, it's important to first understand how to learn ML. We've broken the learning process into four areas of knowledge, with each area providing a foundational piece of the ML puzzle. To help you on your path, we've identified books, videos, and online courses that will uplevel your abilities, and prepare you to use ML for your projects. Start with our guided curriculums designed to increase your knowledge, or choose your own path by exploring our resource library.
Coding skills: Building ML models involves much more than just knowing ML concepts—it requires coding in order to do the data management, parameter tuning, and parsing results needed to test and optimize your model.
Math and stats: ML is a math heavy discipline, so if you plan to modify ML models or build new ones from scratch, familiarity with the underlying math concepts is crucial to the process.
ML theory: Knowing the basics of ML theory will give you a foundation to build on, and help you troubleshoot when something goes wrong.
Build your own projects: Getting hands on experience with ML is the best way to put your knowledge to the test, so don't be afraid to dive in early with a simple colab or tutorial to get some practice.
TensorFlow curriculums
Start learning with one of our guided curriculums containing recommended courses, books, and videos.
For beginners
Basics of machine learning with TensorFlow
Learn the basics of ML with this collection of books and online courses. You will be introduced to ML and guided through deep learning using TensorFlow 2.0. Then you will have the opportunity to practice what you learn with beginner tutorials.
For intermediate level & experts
Theoretical and advanced machine learning with TensorFlow
Once you understand the basics of machine learning, take your abilities to the next level by diving into theoretical understanding of neural networks, deep learning, and improving your knowledge of the underlying math concepts.
For beginners
TensorFlow for JavaScript development
Learn the basics of developing machine learning models in JavaScript, and how to deploy directly in the browser. You will get a high-level introduction on deep learning and on how to get started with TensorFlow.js through hands-on exercises.
Educational resources
Choose your own learning path, and explore books, courses, videos, and exercises recommended by the TensorFlow team to teach you the foundations of ML.
