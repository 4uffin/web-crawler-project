Recommendation systems
From food ordering to video on demand and audio streaming to fashion, recommendation systems
power some of the most popular applications today. Explore how you can build production-ready
recommendation systems with open source libraries and tools from the TensorFlow ecosystem.
Recommendation systems increase user engagement within your app and elevate user experience
by providing the most desirable content. Modern recommenders are complex systems that are
often broken down into multiple stages to achieve low latency in production. Through the
retrieval, ranking, and potentially post-ranking stages, irrelevant items are gradually filtered
out from a large pool of candidates and a list of options that users are the most likely to interact
with are finally presented.
Start building with TensorFlow Recommenders,
an easy-to-use framework that facilitates the full workflow of building a recommender system from data preparation to deployment.
Get started with TensorFlow Recommenders
When you've finished training your models, deploy them into production to serve recommendations to end users. TensorFlow Serving productionizes your models for high performance inference. It aims to maximize the throughput of machine learning models and can support large recommendation models that require distributed serving.
Get started with TensorFlow Serving
# Deploy the retrieval model with TensorFlow Serving
docker run -t --rm -p 8501:8501 \
-v "RETRIEVAL/MODEL/PATH:/models/retrieval" \
-e MODEL_NAME=retrieval tensorflow/serving &
# Retrieve top movies that user 42 may like
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"instances":["42"]}'
\
http://localhost:8501/v1/models/retrieval:predict
# Output
# {
#
"predictions":[
#
{
#
"output_1": [2.032, 1.969, 1.813],
#
"output_2": ["movie1”, “movie2”, “movie3”]
#
}
#
]
# }
# Deploy the ranking model with TensorFlow Serving
docker run -t --rm -p 8501:8501 \
-v "RANKING/MODEL/PATH:/models/ranking" \
-e MODEL_NAME=ranking tensorflow/serving &
# Get the prediction score for user 42 and movie 3
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"instances":[{"user_id":"42", "movie_title":"movie3"}]}' \
http://localhost:8501/v1/models/ranking:predict
# Output:
# {"predictions": [[3.66357923]]}

Improve the retrieval and ranking stages of recommendation engines
Large-scale recommendation systems require the most relevant items to be determined from millions of candidates through the retrieval and ranking stages in an effective and efficient manner. Complement TensorFlow Recommenders with state-of-the-art Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search algorithms and learning-to-rank (LTR) techniques to improve recommendations.
Google ScaNN
ScaNN is a library for vector similarity search at scale. It leverages state-of-the-art ANN
techniques, such as asymmetric hashing and anisotropic quantization, to accelerate retrieval of top candidates.

Preserve user privacy
Traditional recommendation engines rely on collecting user interaction logs and training recommendation models based on raw user activities. Ensure that user data remains private by incorporating Responsible AI development practices.
TensorFlow Lite on-device recommendation
TensorFlow Lite provides an on-device recommendation solution that achieves low-latency and high-quality recommendations, while keeping all user data on the mobile devices.
