An end-to-end platform for machine learning
Prepare and load data for successful ML outcomes
Data can be the most important factor in the success of your ML endeavors.
TensorFlow offers multiple data tools to help you consolidate, clean and preprocess data at scale:
Standard datasets for initial training and validation
Highly scalable data pipelines for loading data
Preprocessing layers for common input transformations
Tools to validate and transform large datasets
Additionally, responsible AI tools help you uncover and eliminate bias in your data to produce fair, ethical outcomes from your models.

Build and fine-tune models with the TensorFlow ecosystem
Explore an entire ecosystem built on the Core framework that streamlines model construction, training, and export. TensorFlow supports distributed training, immediate model iteration and easy debugging with Keras, and much more. Tools like Model Analysis and TensorBoard help you track development and improvement through your model’s lifecycle.
To help you get started, find collections of pre-trained models at TensorFlow Hub from Google and the community, or implementations of state-of-the art research models in the Model Garden. These libraries of high level components allow you to take powerful models, and fine-tune them on new data or customize them to perform new tasks.

Deploy models on-device, in the browser, on-prem, or in the cloud
TensorFlow provides robust capabilities to deploy your models on any environment - servers, edge devices, browsers, mobile, microcontrollers, CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs. TensorFlow Serving can run ML models at production scale on the most advanced processors in the world, including Google's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).
If you need to analyze data close to its source to reduce latency and improve data privacy, the LiteRT framework lets you run models on mobile devices, edge computing devices, and even microcontrollers, and the TensorFlow.js framework lets you run machine learning with just a web browser.

Implement MLOps for production ML
The TensorFlow platform helps you implement best practices for data automation, model tracking, performance monitoring, and model retraining.
Using production-level tools to automate and track model training over the lifetime of a product, service, or business process is critical to success.
TFX provides software frameworks and tooling for full MLOps deployments, detecting issues as your data and models evolve over time.
