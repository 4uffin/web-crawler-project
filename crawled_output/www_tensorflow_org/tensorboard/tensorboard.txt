TensorBoard: TensorFlow's visualization toolkit
TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:
Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)
Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they
change over time
Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space
Displaying images, text, and audio data
Profiling TensorFlow programs
And much more
