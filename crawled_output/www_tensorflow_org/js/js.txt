TensorFlow.js is a library for machine learning in JavaScript
Develop ML models in JavaScript, and use ML directly in the browser or in Node.js.
See tutorials
Tutorials show you how to use TensorFlow.js with complete, end-to-end examples.
See models
Pre-trained, out-of-the-box models for common use cases.
See demos
Live demos and examples run in your browser using TensorFlow.js.
How it works
Run existing models
Use off-the-shelf JavaScript models or convert Python TensorFlow models to run in the browser or under Node.js.
Use official TensorFlow.js models
Convert Python models
Retrain existing models
Retrain pre-existing ML models using your own data.
Use Transfer Learning to customize models
Develop ML with JavaScript
Build and train models directly in JavaScript using flexible and intuitive APIs.
