TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google
Brain team within Google's AI organization. Google open
sourced TensorFlow in the hope of sharing technology with the external community
and encouraging collaboration between researchers and industry. Since then,
TensorFlow has grown into a thriving ecosystem of products, on a wide range of
platforms. But our goal is still to make machine learning accessible to anyone,
anywhere.
