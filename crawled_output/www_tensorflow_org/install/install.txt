Python 3.9–3.12
Ubuntu 16.04 or later
Windows 7 or later (with C++ redistributable)
macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later (no GPU support)
WSL2 via Windows 10 19044 or higher including GPUs (Experimental)
# Requires the latest pip
pip install --upgrade pip
# Current stable release for CPU
pip install tensorflow
# Current stable release for GPU (Linux / WSL2)
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
# Or try the preview build (unstable)
pip install tf-nightly
Download a package
Install TensorFlow with Python's pip package manager. TensorFlow 2 packages require a pip version >19.0 (or >20.3 for macOS). Official packages available for Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.

Run a TensorFlow container
The TensorFlow
Docker images are already configured to run TensorFlow. A
Docker container runs in a
virtual environment and is the easiest way to set up GPU support.
docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:latest
# Download latest stable image docker run -it -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-jupyter
# Start Jupyter server

Google Colab: An easy way to learn and use TensorFlow
No install necessary—run the TensorFlow tutorials directly in
the browser with Colaboratory, a Google research project created to help disseminate
machine learning education and research. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires
no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud.
