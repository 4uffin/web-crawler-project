Image source, EPAThe new Housing Secretary Steve Reed, who replaced Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner following her resignation last week, has re-stated the governmentâs pledge to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by the next election.How achievable is it? The answer is itâs technically possible, but the numbers involved are a very big challenge.Hitting that total over a five-year parliament requires around 300,000 house completions a year â building at a rate not seen since the 1970s. Ministers say output will âramp upâ in the later years.When officials re-calculated how many homes each area needed, external at the end of 2024, they came to a total of 370,000 homes a year. If that level were met in each of the final three years, it would produce just over 1.1 million homes. Add roughly 200,000 homes registered in Labourâs first year â and assuming a similar second year â then on paper the target could be reached.But itâs a challenge. Planning approvals for housing in England fell to a record low last year, with builders report rising brick costs, some councils saying the targets are âunrealisticâ and the Home Builders Federation warning that costs and taxes are climbing.You can see how many homes your area has been told it needs and how many were registered in the last year with BBC Verifyâs housing tracker.

Some online users have been turning to AI tools in an attempt to enhance the grainy images released by the FBI of the person of interest in the killing of Charlie Kirk. Some of these AI-enhanced images are now being widely shared online, including by users with millions of followers. But experts have told BBC Verify that relying on AI-enhanced tools to uncover key details in images is both "risky" and "wrong".
AI tools are trained on lots of high-quality images, which are then blurred so the technology can learn to predict what a clearer version might look like. So, when you ask an AI tool to unblur an image, it is just making a prediction based on the images it has been trained on, says Prof Thomas Nowotny, head of the AI research group at the University of Sussex. In some of the AI-enhanced versions of the FBI images, the technology has distorted the US flag and eagle design that we previously identified on the black shirt worn by the individual. In others, it has added a moustache to the person of interest.âIf you want to enhance your holiday snaps to be sharper, more colourful and crisper and don't need them to actually reflect reality, it's the perfect tool,â says Nowotny.

Image source, TelegramImage caption, We can't see the explosions in this video posted from Tosno but they can be heardThis morning we are looking into reports of a major drone attack on Russia during the night.The defence ministry in Moscow said it intercepted 221 Ukrainian drones. In one video from the town of Tosno in the Leningrad region that we have verified, multiple explosions can be heard although it is unclear what is being targeted.Around 100 miles to the north, in the port town of Primorsk, fires were extinguished on a vessel and at a pumping station, according to regional governor Alexander Drozdenko. As yet, we have been unable to confirm these reports.The scale of the drone attack on Russia is notable, particularly as today marks the start of military exercises involving Russian and Belarusian forces in the Baltic and Barents seas.Phase one of the exercises â dubbed Zapad (West) - will model responses to attacks on the two countries.
