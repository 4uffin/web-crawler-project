Image source, TelegramImage caption, We can't see the explosions in this video posted from Tosno but they can be heardThis morning we are looking into reports of a major drone attack on Russia during the night.The defence ministry in Moscow said it intercepted 221 Ukrainian drones. In one video from the town of Tosno in the Leningrad region that we have verified, multiple explosions can be heard although it is unclear what is being targeted.Around 100 miles to the north, in the port town of Primorsk, fires were extinguished on a vessel and at a pumping station, according to regional governor Alexander Drozdenko. As yet, we have been unable to confirm these reports.The scale of the drone attack on Russia is notable, particularly as today marks the start of military exercises involving Russian and Belarusian forces in the Baltic and Barents seas.Phase one of the exercises â dubbed Zapad (West) - will model responses to attacks on the two countries.
