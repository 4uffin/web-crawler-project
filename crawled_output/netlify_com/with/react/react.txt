Talk to an expertÔªø Love from Twitter for React + Netlify Deploying the react app with deploy preview was much much easier than I thought with @Netlify. It was not that easy when I had tried the same with heroku long time ago.

Used Netlify for the first time yesterday night. Love how easy to deploy it is. Got a React app up in less than 5 minutes. Nice

My mind has just been blown by how easy it is to deploy a React App on Netlify. Are we in ...the future, now?

My word, @GatsbyJS is fast and easy. Coupled with @Netlify I‚Äôve built, tested and deployed a ridiculously fast React PWA in no time at all. From design to deploy in a matter of hours.

Netlify + React is so fast ü§Ø. No time spent on optimizing yet and it feels like I‚Äôm still running it on my local machine.

Tonight‚Äôs random shoutout goes to @netlify, where the Redux org docs have been hosted the last few years.The sites load fast, the build previews are absolutely invaluable, and the generous hosting for OSS projects is a huge piece of support that we really appreciate!
