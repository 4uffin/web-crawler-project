Automatic forms
Build scalable, fullstack apps with Netlify Functions Deploy server-side code that works as API endpoints, runs automatically in response to events, or processes more complex jobs in the background.
Send automated emailFetch live data from an APIReturn dynamic imagesValidate user input
Read the Netlify Functions docs
Example: Send email
import type { Context, Config } from "@netlify/functions";
export default async (req: Request, context: Context) => {
if (req.method !== "POST") return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });
try {
const { name, email, message } = await req.json();
if (!name || !email || !message) return new Response("Missing fields", { status: 400 });
// Mock email API
await fetch("https://api.emailservice.com/send", {
method: "POST",
headers: { "Authorization": `Bearer ${Netlify.env.get("EMAIL_API_KEY")}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
body: JSON.stringify({ to: "test@example.com", subject: `Hello world`, text: `Hello ${name}` })
});
return Response.json({ success: true });
} catch {
return new Response("Server error", { status: 500 });
}
};
Agent-friendly storage for full-stack apps Instantly provision a production-grade database with Netlify DB or use Blobs as a simple key/value store or lightweight database.
Store and retrieve blobs and unstructured data for frequent reads and infrequent writesUse serverless databases to create full-stack appsSet up in minutes with the help of a code agent
Read the Netlify storage docs
Example: Persist user-generated uploads
import { getStore } from "@netlify/blobs";
import type { Context } from "@netlify/functions";
import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";
export default async (req: Request, context: Context) => {
// Accessing the request as `multipart/form-data`.
const form = await req.formData();
const file = form.get("file") as File;
// Generating a unique key for the entry.
const key = uuid();
const uploads = getStore("file-uploads");
await uploads.set(key, file, {
metadata: { country: context.geo.country.name }
});
return new Response("Submission saved");
};
