Welcome to the Jamstack
The Jamstack has helped the Peloton site scale to
millions
of visitors. A new approach to faster, more secure websites.
+
All sites on Netlify are prebuilt for performance and deployed directly to our
global edge network
—without requiring you to manage, scale, or patch any web servers. This enables a revolutionary new
architecture
called the
Jamstack
, designed to make the web faster—and to support the new tools and workflows used in modern web development.
Request demo The problem with the legacy web
Web server
(like Apache)
Application
(like WordPress)
Database
(like MySQL) Complex apps and complex servers A traditional website is actually a program that has to run on a
web
server at all times. Running sites this way needlessly slows things down, provides way
too
many opportunities for attack, and is expensive to scale. What the Jamstack delivers
Faster websites Optimize your site with prerendering and global delivery.
More secure infrastructure By design, Jamstack architectures offer fewer points of attack.
High scale without high complexity Prerendered frontends served at the edge are inherently scalable.
Improved developer experience Launch faster with more productive dev & deployment cycles. How it works
Decoupling the frontend from the backend Unlike the large legacy apps, Jamstack projects neatly separate
the
frontend pages and UI from the backend apps and databases. Freed from backend servers, the frontend can then
be
deployed globally, directly to a CDN.
Prebuilding all pages for speed Before deployment, the entire frontend is prebuilt into highly
optimized static pages and assets. This happens in a build process (before being deployed / hosted). Dynamic content via APIs The global frontend uses JavaScript and APIs to talk to backend
services, allowing pages to be enhanced and personalized. How it advances the web
Running sites on web servers
replaced by
Deploying sites globally A Jamstack deployment doesn’t
run
on a traditional setup of origin servers. Instead, automated deployments are used to push sites directly to
the
Edge / CDN.
Webpages rendered at runtime
replaced by
Webpages prerendered for speed Rather than building content
at
runtime for each request, content is prebuilt and optimized during a build setup using a site generator and
other
build tools.
Monolithic applications
replaced by
APIs & Microservices Decoupling the frontend from
the
backend allows for more modular development where we can take advantage of the huge ecosystem of third party
tools
to provide website functionality. BYOT: Bring your own technologies Prebuilding all pages for speed The Jamstack doesn’t change the technologies you use—Jamstack sites
can be
built in JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python or virtually any language. It’s not a collection of specific software,
it’s a
set of best practices that combines:
Git Workflows The Jamstack ties deployments closely to a Git-based workflows.
Git
brings the rigor and safety of version control to web projects allowing support for large projects with
numerous
contributors.
Modern build tools With a build run every time a deploy happens, The Jamstack brings
full
support for linting code, transpiling javascript, compiling CSS, and optimizing html and assets.
CDN Technology First deployed by large enterprises, the Jamstack democratizes the
use
of CDN technology to deliver web content from end points as close to users as possible. What’s the catch? Modern web development requires modern tools and infrastructure.
Wiring this stuff together on your own can be challenging, even when using cloud services like AWS. (Some
tutorials run 13-15 steps for setup alone! Really.) And that’s exactly why we started Netlify.
We’re making it possible to build and deploy production Jamstack sites in seconds.
Netlify is proud to be the first infrastructure provider native to
the
Jamstack and designed to support modern tools and workflows. Tools for the Jamstack Software / Services
