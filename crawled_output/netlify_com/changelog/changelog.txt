Netlify pricing update: Introducing credit-based plans
September 5, 2025
We’ve simplified our pricing to make it more transparent and predictable.
Our new credit-based plans are now available for new accounts.
Current customers: You can stay on your legacy plan with no action required. The ability to optionally update to new plans will be available soon.
What’s new
Credit-based billing replaces complex metrics. Instead of tracking 15+ separate metrics, add-on packages, and usage tiers, you now have a single credit balance to monitor. Check your credit usage at a glance and dive into Account usage insights for details.
Three plans
PlanMonthly creditsPriceTeam sizeFree300$01 Team OwnerPersonal1,000$9/month1 Team OwnerPro5,000$20/member/monthUnlimited members
New Personal plan benefits
Purchase additional credits as needed
7-day project analytics and Real User Metrics
Priority email support
Smart secret detection to prevent credential leaks
Option to add concurrent build capacity
Controlling costs
While the free plan is still always free, our paid credit-based plans also offer you control over what happens when your site or app runs out of credits.
You can keep costs predictable by waiting till your monthly credits refresh at the start of your billing cycle or you can set up auto recharge, which allows you to buy more credits in smaller increments as your web project needs them. Auto recharge is turned off by default and as a Team Owner you can turn on or off at any time.
Paid plans have the option to purchase additional credits in these increments:
Personal plans: 200 credits for $5 USD
Pro plans: 1000 credits for $20 USD
Simplified metered billing
Here is how credit usage is calculated by Netlify’s metered billing at a high-level. For more detailed and technical explanations, check out our docs on How credits work.
You can also explore pricing estimates with our Pricing estimation calculator.

Security Update: Multiple vulnerabilities in Next.js
August 30, 2025
security
next.js
We are aware of recently disclosed vulnerabilities affecting Next.js applications:
CVE-2025-55173: Next.js Image Optimization – Arbitrary File Download
CVE-2025-57822: Next.js Middleware – SSRF via Misuse of next()
CVE-2025-57752: Next.js Image Optimization – Cache Poisoning / Unauthorized Disclosure
As a security precaution, we recommend upgrading to the latest versions of Next.js and enabling automatic updates of the OpenNext Netlify Next.js adapter.
The engineering team at Netlify has reviewed these and determined the following impact on Netlify sites:
*
CVE-2025-55173: Next.js Image Optimization – Arbitrary File Download
Sites on Netlify are not vulnerable.
Next.js sites on Netlify use Netlify’s Image CDN instead of the affected built-in Next.js Image Optimization feature. Furthermore, Netlify Image CDN strips Content-Disposition headers, which is required for successful exploitation of this vulnerability.
With this header removed it is not possible to force a file download or override the filename, even in case of a mismatch between the requested image type and the source file type.
CVE-2025-57822: Next.js Middleware – SSRF via Misuse of next()
Sites on Netlify are not vulnerable.
Our OpenNext adapter uses Edge Functions to run middleware and relies on the context.next() API as the underlying implementation of NextResponse.next() calls, passing the original request URL and preventing this attack vector.
CVE-2025-57752: Next.js Image Optimization – Cache Poisoning / Unauthorized Disclosure
Next.js sites on Netlify are potentially vulnerable, if the sites use the next/image component to fetch images from a source that uses headers to conditionally serve images.
Next.js sites using the next/image component will automatically opt into Netlify’s Image CDN which, by design, will automatically cache the source assets on Netlify’s Edge Cache. This means that a source image that is served behind an authorization header will get cached on the Netlify Edge Cache in order to improve performance. Upgrading to the newest version of Next.js will not change this behavior.
If your Next.js site serves images from a protected source, we advise you to not use the next/image component so that you have full control over the caching and authorization strategies required for your use-case.
We are working continually with the Next.js team and are committed to making your sites secure on Netlify.

ChatGPT deep link for failed deploy analysis
July 30, 2025
Debugging a failing deploy can involve a lot of context switching between your deploy logs and external tools. We’ve added a new option to deep link directly into ChatGPT with your deploy analysis. Now you can get immediate AI-powered insights and debugging help without manually copying and pasting log information.
How it works
When a deploy fails, you’ll see a “Why did it fail?” option. Clicking this now presents an “Ask ChatGPT” button which automatically opens and pre-populates ChatGPT with the relevant deploy context.
Example use cases
Quickly understand common errors in your build output.
Get suggestions for fixing dependency issues.
Receive explanations for unfamiliar error messages.
Getting started
Next time you encounter a failed deploy, look for the “Ask ChatGPT” option in your deploy logs.

Equinix IP address expiring for 4-year old sites
July 21, 2025
domains
As part of our infrastructure improvements, we’re updating certain IP addresses for older sites.
Some sites that have been live on Netlify for over 4 years will need to update their DNS by August 31, 2025 to avoid going offline.
Who is impacted
Your site may be using the outdated Equinix IP address 147.75.40.150, if your site meets the following criteria:
Your site has been live since around March 25, 2021
Your site is using our Standard Edge CDN
You are on a free, starter, or Pro account
To check whether your site is impacted you can:
Enter your site domain on this DNS lookup site to see if your domain points to 147.75.40.150: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/
Alternatively, you can run the dig command in your terminal with your site domain, such as dig mytestsite.com (using mytestsite.com and not www.mytestsite.com because this is an apex domain)
Action required
To avoid downtime by August 31, 2025, take the following actions.
Standard action for most plans
Only Enterprise plans can have High-Performance Edge. If you do not have an Enterprise plan or have an Enterprise plan without High-Performance Edge:
Update the DNS record for your apex domain from the previous load balancer IP address 147.75.40.150 to the following:
If your external DNS provider supports ALIAS, ANAME, or flattened CNAME records, update your site’s IP address from 147.75.40.150 to
apex-loadbalancer.netlify.com. If your site is on the High-Performance Edge, point the record to the High-Performance Edge load balancer noted in the Netlifly domains dashboard when you select Awaiting External DNS. You can reach out to Support or your Account manager for help.
If your DNS provider does not support ALIAS, ANAME, or flattened CNAME records, update your site’s IP address from 147.75.40.150 to
75.2.60.5.
The exact way you update this will vary depending on your external DNS provider but here are some generalized docs for configuring an apex domain that you can use. For the most specific instructions, check your external DNS provider’s docs or support.
Action for Enterprise plans with High-Performance Edge
Only Enterprise plans can have High-Performance Edge. If you have an Enterprise plan with High-Performance Edge, follow these steps:
Update the DNS record for your apex domain from the previous load balancer IP address 147.75.40.150 to the following:
If your external DNS provider supports ALIAS, ANAME, or flattened CNAME records, update your site’s IP address from 147.75.40.150 to your High-Performance Edge load balancer. You can ask your Account Manager for this information or check your Netlify domains dashboard for this information.
If your DNS provider does not support ALIAS, ANAME, or flattened CNAME records, update your site’s IP address from 147.75.40.150 to
75.2.60.5.
The exact way you update this will vary depending on your external DNS provider but here are some generalized docs for configuring an apex domain that you can use. For the most specific instructions, check your external DNS provider’s docs or support.
Why is this happening?
To improve our infrastructure and performance, we are updating certain IP addresses for older sites. These changes help ensure your sites and apps can fully benefit from Netlify’s Edge network and our improved load balancing infrastructure.
Need more help?
If you need extra help, just let us know by reaching out to Netlify Support.
