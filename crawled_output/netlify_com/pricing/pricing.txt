FAQ
I’m an existing Netlify customer, do I have to change plans?
No, if you created a Netlify account before September 4, 2025, you can keep your current plan. No changes needed.
If you want to migrate to the new plans and are a Team Owner, go to Usage & billing > Plan details and select the Change team plan button to choose your new plan.
I have a legacy pricing plan. Where did the pricing plan table and FAQ information go that I still need?
We got you. You can check pricing plan details for your current plan from your Netlify team dashboard at Usage & billing.
If you have a legacy pricing plan, then you can check out our legacy pricing plan FAQ.
How do credits work for bandwidth, compute, forms submissions, and web requests, and production deploys?
Each metered feature consumes a certain number of credits based on how much your projects use.
Learn more about how each feature or meter is measured using credits in our How credits work docs.
What happens when a project reaches its credit limit?
When a site reaches its monthly usage limits, it enters a paused state until the start of the next billing cycle. We’ll notify you by email and in-app as you approach your limits at 50%, 75%, and 100% of usage. Please note that if one project exceeds its limits, all projects on your account will be paused.
You can re-enable your sites at any time by upgrading your plan. Your projects will automatically resume normal operation after upgrading.
How does billing work for metered features and extra usage packages?
You can enable auto recharge for projects on your team, which ensures they stay active and can receive web requests, form submissions, and more.
Learn more about how you can buy more credits when you run out in smaller batches with auto recharge.
Can I set a hard spending limit for metered features and have it shut off when the limit is reached?
The free plan is always free, with hard monthly limits that cannot be exceeded or incur any costs. Paid plans have spend control using the auto recharge setting for credits, which automatically refills your credit balance in small increments based on your plan.
Auto recharge is turned off by default so you just need to keep it off. Only Team Owners can enable auto recharge.
How does pricing work for adding people to my Netlify team?
If you have a Free
or Personal plan, you cannot add any additional team member seats.
If you have a Pro plan, then you can add additional team member seats to your team. With any plan, you can add unlimited free Reviewer roles to your team to give people a Netlify login that they can use to review your team’s web projects and share feedback.
Learn more about how roles and permissions work.
Can I pay with PayPal, wire transfer, crypto, or any method other than credit card?
Netlify only accepts credit cards unless you have a Netlify Enterprise plan, in which case we do accept payment via ACH or wire transfer.
