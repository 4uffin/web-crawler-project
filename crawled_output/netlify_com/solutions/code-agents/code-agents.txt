Focus on AI. We'll handle the rest.
Your AI platform generates code in seconds. Netlify deploys instantly. Users get live URLs without friction, keeping them engaged with your platform while you focus on improving your agent’s capabilities.
With Netlify we offer easy, one-click deployment for apps and sites built with Bolt. This removes the complexity of launching and scaling so creators can focus on what matters most.
Eric Simons
Founder & CEO, Bolt
Why platforms choose Netlify
Instant deploys. Pipeline built for deploying AI-generated code fast, with zero config for any frontend framework.
Flexible UX.
Let users deploy and claim using their own Netlify accounts or integrate deeply into your own custom UI.
Partners, not competitors. We don’t build fullstack codegen tools, we build the infrastructure to power them.
Any framework. React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Astro – automatic detection and optimization with zero config.
Fullstack ready. Serverless functions, forms, databases, object storage, all managed by Netlify.
Scale to millions, safely. Isolate every user’s project with scoped accounts and usage controls, so one user can’t affect the rest.
Play
