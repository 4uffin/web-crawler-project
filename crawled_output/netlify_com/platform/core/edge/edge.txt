The fast, resilient
network for web apps
Make your websites & applications
dramatically
faster Global distribution with
automated
prerendering makes for impressively fast site delivery. Smashing Magazine moved to Netlify for a 10× boost
in
performance.

Extremely reliable. Extremely secure.
Every deploy publishes your apps
to
be served across all of our global edge locations—your own web servers and CDN are no longer required. And
with our High-Performance Edge, your apps are deployed to multiple cloud providers for ultimate
reliability.
Since web pages are rendered in advance, edge nodes serve secure, static assets with little opportunity
for
exploit.
No maintenance windows, broken deploys, or
stale content Cache control on most CDNs is
tricky
business. On Netlify Edge, every global deploy is an instant, atomic update of your application. Worldwide
caches are invalidated instantly, supporting richer applications than possible on a CDN. Deploy thousands
of
times daily without any risk of partial deploys or stale assets.
Edge personalization made easy
Use Netlify Edge Functions to
run
custom logic at the network edge using standards-based Deno runtime. Deliver incredibly fast dynamic
experiences — instantly localize language, serve relevant banner ads, customize authentication....and much
more. Edge Functions offer native integration with web frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, and Remix, so
developers
can easily manage frontend and backend code together.
Fine-grained control: redirect, proxy, and
restrict access Control how Netlify Edge handles
requests right inside your Git repository using a simple, text-based configuration to set up redirects by
country or language, apply custom headers, or control access to certain paths of your application. Netlify
Edge even offers powerful proxy capabilities so you can unite a legacy blog, remote APIs, and new pages
into a
single domain.
