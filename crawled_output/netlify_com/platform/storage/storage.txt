Designed for developers – and AI agents
Netlify’s storage primitives are built for modern workflows and designed for agent experience: zero-config, fully programmable, and ready for anything.
Zero friction for AI agents
Watch agents provision databases and execute queries as fast as they can generate code. No authentication flows, no manual configs–just pure execution speed.
Works any way, any stack
Whether you’re typing commands yourself or delegating to an AI assistant, Netlify’s storage speaks your language and works with your framework.
Scale without switching
Start small and grow without limits. From prototype to production, your storage scales alongside your project.
