Brand assets Download and use the logo assets below. Please do not modify or change the resources. Be sure to abide by the usage rules noted under each asset.
Full logo
The full logo comes in two sizes: ‚ÄúLarge‚Äù is optimized for scenarios where Netlify is at the center of attention. Example on t-shirts, event banners, and animated intros. Use ‚Äúsmall‚Äù when our logo shares space with other content. For example, in website navigation, paid ads, and email headers.
Monogram logo
Whenever possible use the full logo, but there are special occasions when a monogram is more appropriate. For example, in collapsed left navigation UI, or on a baseball hat.
Encapsulated logo
The encapsulated logo version works well when the background graphics are too busy to see the monogram version clearly or when Netlify is presented alongside other logos in an encapsulated format, such as a logo garden or directory site.
Brand guidelines
See the Netlify Brand Guide for detailed guidance to communicate brand consistency, including typography, color, and tone across various channels.
