Alison Herman
Variety
The plot prefers to hammer the viewer with the simplistic image of good guy Americans versus “monsters at the door” over the finer points of geopolitical conflict.

Keith Watson
Daily Telegraph (UK)
Kitsch is a diverting anti-hero, morphing from fraternity-embracing band of brother to an “every man for himself” everyman. Thanks to him, The Terminal List: Dark Wolf has just enough brain to compensate for its overdose of gun-toting brawn.
Rated: 3/5

The show consistently brings the action and the boom factor, big time.

CBR
The Terminal List: Dark Wolf takes fans on an action-packed journey into the life of Ben Edwards before his time in Chris Pratt's The Terminal List. The story itself is compelling and dark, even if it takes a while to find its footing.
Rated: 6/10

In a world of seemingly endless movies and series about spycraft, soldiers at war, or returning from war, government agents, and espionage, Dark Wolf does nothing to stand out from the pack.

The Terminal List: Dark Wolf is a masterful continuation of the 1st season, and it absolutely delivers on every level. What stands out most is the seamless way they weaved individual storylines into the broader storyline . Each character arc feels purposeful, every subplot threads into the larger tapestry, and the result is a story that is both tightly focused and richly layered.
The pacing is exceptional—tense and relentless when it needs to be, but deliberate enough to let us sink into the personal journeys of the characters. They manage to balance action with depth, giving us moments of reflection and humanity alongside heart-pounding sequences of suspense.
In short, Dark Wolf is a must watch for action and suspense enthusiasts

Every character here have a dark side and a grey heart. In fact good action and acting deliver a prequel better than the orginal series.
Maybe a too little good americans vs the world but this is not a geopolitical documentary, is action thriller at his best.
