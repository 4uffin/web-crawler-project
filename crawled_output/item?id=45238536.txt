Gemini is a part of the “small internet” movement: https://www.linuxpromagazine.com/index.php/Issues/2021/245/T...replybovermyer 1 hour ago

A month or so ago, I migrated all of my Gemini posts to my blog and shut down my Gemini server.For me there wasn't really a point to the effort. I'm glad the protocol exists and that people are enjoying it, but I'll stick to HTML.replyprmoustache 32 minutes ago

It is rather easy to have one running alongside the other and the gemtext syntax is such it is quite easy to make automatic converters. Did you encounter issues maintaining both?I mean I truly believe anyone can do small websites using HTML standards so for the actual content producer Gemini doesn't have much appeal. On the other hand using Gemini provide the users/visitors a guarantee they will not end up following a link and ending up in a bloated, privacy and ad nightmare. So I think it is sane to offer that even if you believe in small regular web.replyfrizlab 3 hours ago

So glad to see the actual Gemini here instead of the modern AI horror most of the people think about when hearing Gemini.replyJimDabell 55 minutes ago

You’re so glad that, rather than discuss it, you redirect the conversation back to Google’s Gemini?replyjmclnx 3 hours ago

Plus glad to see it call "Gemini" instead of "Gemini Protocol", too bad google stole the name after Gemini was a thing.
And unlike gopher, Gemini renders fine on Cell Phones.As I mentioned before in these threads, I find Gemini far easier to maintain then anything associated with html.
It is very simple.
I had moved my WEB space to Gemini on sdf* a while ago and my old WEB space points to my Gemini Site.FWIW, google forced Gemini to change its URLs, it is now:https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/gemtext-specification.gmiand the FAQ, the article has the old URLhttps://geminiprotocol.net/docs/faq.gmi* sdf:https://wiki.sdf.org/doku.php?id=gemini_site_setup_and_hosti...List of clients are here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)replyhamdingers 36 minutes ago

Never heard of it, but what's the difference with the web in 1994?replyprmoustache 30 minutes ago

The difference is you can actually access it today without fear of being thrown back in 2025 by doing such a simple thing as following a link on the same protocol.replyStevePerkins 2 hours ago

TLS. Beyond that, as little as possible is basically the goal.replyisoprophlex 2 hours ago

But but but... how would this would allow me to run arbitrary client-side code in order to snoop on users, mine shitcoins or enforce DRM?!replysunrunner 1 hour ago

> Simpler> Human Scale> Distraction Free> Privacy ProtectingSimilar to the indie web/slow web movements, it's genuinely a shame that these qualities are essentially anathema to the business model of so much of modern social media.reply
