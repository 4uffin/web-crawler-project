The lack of images made Gemini unworkable for me. I know it's by design, but illustrations are an important part of my writing.It's more sensible to build the sort of websites I want to see, and to use Reader Mode for other people's websites.replyar_lan 3 minutes ago

When I was younger, I thought Gemini was very cool mostly because it was an alternative protocol to the mainstream. It made me feel very inner-circle in the development world, for some reason.As I've grown, I've come to learn I'm a very visual learner. I've learned that "clear is kind", and for many, image and text are both important, but many images have a way of conveying what is difficult to express in words without being overly verbose.I agree, illustrations are an essential part, especially when teaching something.replybovermyer 2 hours ago

A month or so ago, I migrated all of my Gemini posts to my blog and shut down my Gemini server.For me there wasn't really a point to the effort. I'm glad the protocol exists and that people are enjoying it, but I'll stick to HTML.replyprmoustache 1 hour ago

It is rather easy to have one running alongside the other and the gemtext syntax is such it is quite easy to make automatic converters. Did you encounter issues maintaining both?I mean I truly believe anyone can do small websites using HTML standards so for the actual content producer Gemini doesn't have much appeal. On the other hand using Gemini provide the users/visitors a guarantee they will not end up following a link and ending up in a bloated, privacy and ad nightmare. So I think it is sane to offer that even if you believe in small regular web.replythrow310822 4 hours ago

Never heard of it, but what's the difference with the web in 1994?replyprmoustache 1 hour ago

The difference is you can actually access it today without fear of being thrown back in 2025 by doing such a simple thing as following a link on the same protocol.replyStevePerkins 3 hours ago

TLS. Beyond that, as little as possible is basically the goal.replyleephillips 59 minutes ago

So glad to see the actual Gemini here instead of the modern AI horror most of the people think about when hearing Gemini.replyJimDabell 1 hour ago

You’re so glad that, rather than discuss it, you redirect the conversation back to Google’s Gemini?replyjmclnx 4 hours ago

Plus glad to see it call "Gemini" instead of "Gemini Protocol", too bad google stole the name after Gemini was a thing.
And unlike gopher, Gemini renders fine on Cell Phones.As I mentioned before in these threads, I find Gemini far easier to maintain then anything associated with html.
It is very simple.
I had moved my WEB space to Gemini on sdf* a while ago and my old WEB space points to my Gemini Site.FWIW, google forced Gemini to change its URLs, it is now:https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/gemtext-specification.gmiand the FAQ, the article has the old URLhttps://geminiprotocol.net/docs/faq.gmi* sdf:https://wiki.sdf.org/doku.php?id=gemini_site_setup_and_hosti...List of clients are here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)replykarmakaze 19 minutes ago

From the Wiki page the formatting capabilities to me look too limiting. How about tables? Are nested (numbered/bulleted) lists a thing?replyhamdingers 1 hour ago

But but but... how would this would allow me to run arbitrary client-side code in order to snoop on users, mine shitcoins or enforce DRM?!replysunrunner 2 hours ago

> Simpler> Human Scale> Distraction Free> Privacy ProtectingSimilar to the indie web/slow web movements, it's genuinely a shame that these qualities are essentially anathema to the business model of so much of modern social media.reply
