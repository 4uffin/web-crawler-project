Worth the Hype?
Putting viral products to the test. Explore the series
There seems to be a new, trendy powerhouse ingredient making waves on the beauty side of TikTok every few days. Recently, onion extract has become an increasingly popular pick, due in no small part to the popularity of Natural Sant’s Onion, Biotin and Rosemary Shampoo and Treatment Set. Available on Amazon, this hair care set claims to help grow, strengthen and thicken any type of hair and is hailed by reviewers who are looking to fight hair thinning.
While not every recommendation you see online is going to be a winner, we’ve discovered some of our favorite beauty products in the social media trenches. That’s why we went hands-on with this Natural Sant set to see if it’s a hair care find that’s truly worth the hype.
Natural Sant Onion, Biotin and Rosemary Shampoo and Treatment Set
Amazon
Though plenty of users love this Natural Sant set for growing and fortifying their hair, I wasn’t impressed by the formula, which left my hair feeling dry, heavy and hard to style instead of strong and soft. For $25, you get a decent amount of product between the two bottles, but I’d rather invest in more concentrated and direct scalp care options to maintain my hair’s healthy look and feel.
$25 at Amazon
Why it’s going viral
CNN Underscored’s associate programming editor Kevin Martinez tipped us off to this Natural Sant set after it consumed his TikTok “For You” page. The brand claims that this $25 set helps to grow, strengthen and thicken strands with the help of ingredients like onion extract, rosemary oil and biotin. It’s also garnered hundreds of 5-star Amazon reviews from users who praise the set for reducing hair loss. Martinez said he and many other online users were impressed by the results posted by NYC-based creator Angie Roman, who documented her journey using the set over several months.
While biotin and rosemary have long been popular ingredients for helping to look after your locks, the Natural Sant set introduced many people to onion extract for the first time. The brand says that the onion extract in the formula helps to control excess oil and stimulate hair growth, a claim that has been shown to have some scientific validity. In fact, in the weeks since the product’s viral moment, some TikTok users have even shown themselves rubbing raw onion directly on their hair and scalp to help it grow faster. While I didn’t take measures quite that extreme, I did test the Natural Sant treatment set out for myself for over a month, evaluating how it made my hair look and feel, and consulting experts about the effectiveness of its hero ingredients.
Is it worth the hype?
Unfortunately, this set missed the mark for me, and I didn’t feel that it improved my hair’s look or feel in any remarkable way. In fact, in some ways, it made my hair worse.
During my testing, I kept my entire hair care routine the same, aside from swapping out my regular shampoo and conditioner for the Natural Sant set. First, no, it does not make your hair smell like onions. Online users described the set as having a berry scent, which I agree with. I also detected a slight floral note, but there’s no onion scent whatsoever. It doesn’t smell incredible, but it’s a pleasant enough scent to clean your hair with. The shampoo has a gel-like consistency that foamed up nicely when I rubbed it on my scalp and rinsed out easily. I felt it did a good job of cleaning my hair and removing product buildup, sweat and debris, but it left my hair feeling extremely dry, stripped and stringy immediately after rinsing.

To counter this, I was hoping that the conditioner would be ultra hydrating. The bottle I received instructed me to use the conditioner as a leave-in treatment, applying it from my mid-lengths to my ends and leaving it on until my next hair wash. However, there seem to be some bottles of this conditioner with conflicting directions, as some reviewers have posted pictures of instructions that say to rinse the conditioner off after five minutes. The directions don’t say how much of the conditioner to use, so I just took an educated guess that a nickel-sized dollop would be sufficient to coat my ends. They don’t say at what point in the hair-cleansing process you should apply it to hair either, so I combed it through after lightly towel-drying my hair post-shower.
Once again, the conditioner was easy to spread, but after my hair had fully dried, I felt that instead of penetrating and hydrating my hair, the conditioner just seemed to sit on top and weigh it down. It left behind a residue that made my hair feel more greasy than soft. I already have a hard time applying oils or heavy leave-in treatments to my hair without it looking greasy, so I wasn’t entirely surprised by this. Generally, I was just disappointed that the conditioner didn’t nourish my hair better, especially given how drying the shampoo had been. Over the month of testing, I experimented with using less of the conditioner on my hair, but it always left the same feeling behind.

As for the hair growth claims, I didn’t detect any signs of new growth. Hair growth itself depends on a multitude of factors, such as genetics, age, lifestyle and the surrounding environment, which makes it hard to isolate the effects of this set on its own. My hair did feel thicker, but I think this had more to do with the residue left behind by the leave-in than any actual changes in my hair follicles. I also felt that my hair was harder to manage and style. I shampooed and conditioned my hair almost daily with this set and instead of looking bouncy and soft, my hair just looked stiff, dry and staticky.

I don’t personally struggle with hair loss or maintaining natural shine — if anything my hair is the opposite and a professional hair stylist even once described my strands as “slippery” — so I understand I might not be the target clientele for this Natural Sant set. Though it didn’t do anything amazing for my straight, semi-fine hair, this treatment set could yield different results on those with thicker, more textured hair or with different hair porosities.
I do appreciate that the Natural Sant set is only $25 and that you get a good amount of product for your money. Even after a month of daily hair washing, I’m still only about a fourth of the way through the bottles. However, I won’t be continuing to use this set once my current bottles run out. Instead, I’m going to stick with a drugstore hair care set (which is actually even cheaper) and opt to add in more potent scalp oils or restorative treatments (like the ones included below) when I want to grow, strengthen or have more shine in my strands.

Bottom line
The Natural Sant Onion and Biotin set didn’t work wonders on my hair. I found the shampoo to be very drying, and the leave-in conditioner always seemed to leave a lingering residue on my hair, no matter how sparingly I applied it. During my testing, I didn’t experience any of the nourishing effects the treatment set claims to provide or spot any noticeable thickening, strengthening or growth of my hair. Though for a better measure of these effects, you’d need to test the product consistently for several months. Overall, I felt that this set made my hair more difficult to manage and style on a daily basis, and for me, that outweighed any greater effects this product might have with more prolonged use.
Though I found the shampoo drying, it was effective at cleaning my hair, and for $25 a set, you’ll be able to get several months of use from both the shampoo and conditioner. If you’re still curious to try this set out for yourself, it’s not likely to cause any damage to your strands. However, I’d still opt for supplemental hair and scalp treatments that are more nourishing and have higher concentrations of hair-loved ingredients like onion extract, rosemary oil or biotin.
FAQs
The following FAQs have been answered by dermatologists Dr. Jacob Beer and Dr. Marisa Garshick, and include reporting by associate editor Jillian Tracy.
Are onion, rosemary and biotin good for your hair?
Dermatologist Dr. Jacob Beer said that biotin is a vitamin that’s essential for hair growth, as it helps the mitochondria of the hair follicles function properly. “However, external biotin such as in supplements is only beneficial in those with biotin deficiency,” he said. “For most of the population who have normal biotin levels, adding additional biotin is not beneficial.”
As for rosemary oil, board-certified dermatologist Dr. Marisa Garshick said that it can help reduce breakage by strengthening and conditioning the hair. Some studies have shown that rosemary oil can also improve circulation in the scalp, which may aid in stimulating hair growth.
Onion extract is a less popular ingredient, but some limited research claims that the concentrations of zinc, iron and sulfur found in onion extract can help to produce essential oils, carry more oxygen to the scalp and strengthen hair, respectively.
Beer added that most hair treatments, including natural or at-home remedies, will take a minimum of three to six months of consistent use before you’ll see any noticeable results. “At-home and natural remedies can be great for patients,” he said. “However, I believe they should be used to augment the efficacy of prescribed treatments or procedures.”
Do onions and rosemary help hair growth?
The dermatologists I consulted for a previous story on rosemary oil said that some studies have shown that it can help boost hair growth. While the overall evidence is still quite limited, it’s thought that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in rosemary oil help protect the hair from oxidative stress and environmental aggressors, which, in turn, helps prevent hair loss. Rosemary oil is also thought to improve circulation in the scalp, which, by increasing blood flow and delivering more oxygen and nutrients to the follicles, can help stimulate hair growth.
As for onion, some studies have shown that onion extract is an effective option for treating hair loss. However, Beer said these studies only show onion extract as an effective option for treating alopecia areata, an autoimmune type of hair loss, and not the pattern hair loss many people experience with age and hormonal changes (called androgenetic alopecia). “Onion extract has components such as quercetin that are anti-inflammatory as well as pro-growth,” Beer said and added that onion extract can help stimulate the growth phase of the hair cycle.
Does the Natural Sant Onion, Biotin and Rosemary Shampoo and Treatment Set contain parabens or silicone?
Yes. Even though the Amazon description claims that this Natural Sant set is silicone-free, the ingredient list says otherwise. The back of the shampoo bottle lists dimethiconol and cyclopentasiloxane among the ingredients, both of which are silicones. While the shampoo and conditioner do appear to be free from parabens, the shampoo lists some sulfates among its ingredients — like tea-dodecylbenzenesulfonate and sodium laureth sulfate — which can leave strands feeling extra dry or stripped.
