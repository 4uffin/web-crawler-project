Find resources and coursesStart learning to code by finding online resources that can help put you on the path to fluency. Many people start by exploring coding communities like DevCommunity, GitHub, and Stack Overflow. Here, you can find coders who, at one point, were like you — curious about how to grow their coding skills.You can also find online coding courses. Many people start learning to code by taking a course because it provides guidance, feedback, and a set timeline for learning, which you may not have when you learn independently. For example, a beginner coding course may offer professional resources and built-in exercises to guide your progress.2. Master programming basicsAfter becoming comfortable with a language, focus on foundational programming concepts:Data Types: Understand how computers represent different kinds of data, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.Variables: Learn how to assign and reference data points throughout your code.Data Structures: Learn about stacks, queues, dictionaries, trees, and more for efficient collection, storage, and management.Lists/Arrays: Group and manipulate collections of data.Algorithms: Develop rules that a computer can enact on a dataset.Debugging: Find and solve problems within your code.3. Practice coding dailyThe path to coding fluency involves consistent practice, regardless of the language. Start by completing simple online exercises like "Hello, world!" and challenges from coding foundations like FreeCodeCamp. These exercises allow you to work through coding problems firsthand, helping you advance both your technical and analytical skills.At the same time, consider new ways to grow your soft skills as a coder. Online exercises can help you develop skills like problem-solving and attention to detail, but look for ways to address other professional skills, too. For example, you may improve your teamwork and communication skills by playing in a community sports league or volunteering at your local library.4. Develop independent projectsAs your skills advance, you may begin to develop personal projects to practice "thinking like a coder." You can code calculators, number games, predictive models, or a personal portfolio website. These projects can help you hone critical programming skills like:Problem-solvingCommunicationAttention to detailAdaptabilityCreativityYou can also consult developer platforms like GitHub and AWS CodeCommit. These platforms host projects so you can develop, alter, and store them online. Developer platforms also help users share their work and provide editing access to teammates or prospective employers.5. Build a portfolioA programming portfolio is a collection of projects demonstrating your ability to write and run code successfully. Coding a personal website has advantages beyond helping you practice your programming skills. A personal portfolio showcases your ability to create dynamic, responsive website features, which can appeal to employers.You could also build a portfolio using an online software hosting platform like GitHub or Launchpad. These tools allow developers to create software, store it, and share it with collaborators or potential employers.What you learn in coding coursesBeginner coding skillsBeginner coding courses focus on the fundamentals of coding, which include:AlgebraLogicSyntaxCode structureVersion controlDebuggingExplore JavaScript for BeginnersIntermediate coding skillsIn an intermediate coding course, you can learn more advanced skills, such as:Algorithmic designData structuresObject-oriented programmingSystem designAsynchronous programmingDevOpsOptimizationExplore Cloud and Application Development FoundationsExpert coding skillsAs you gain experience, you may look for opportunities to innovate your field or lead a team to success.
