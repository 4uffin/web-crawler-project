Now there's a blast from the past. Irrlichts heyday was around ~2010, but it looks like there's still a few people keeping the lights on.TIL it was actually used in a commercial game (Bugsnax) relatively recently, although the devs said that it will be their final release on the engine.https://xcancel.com/luthyr/status/1271866001467080705replygaraetjjte 56 minutes ago

I remember a time when the topic of a lot of forum posts was Irrlicht vs. Ogre3D. If I recall correctly, Ogre3D was harder to get started with and had a smaller scope (just the scene graph), but was the better of the two 3D scene graph implementations.replygatane 49 minutes ago

Kind of, they forked Irrlicht and took it in their own direction.https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/tree/master/irrreply
