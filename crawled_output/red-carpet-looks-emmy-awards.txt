Red carpet season is well and truly underway, with the biggest — and most stylish — names in television descending on LA’s Peacock Theater for the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards.Compared to the bold looks at last weekend’s MTV Video Music Awards, this is a typically more formal affair. The elegant eveningwear on show may also offer clues about the trends that will unfold between now and the Oscars next March.Fashion-forward cast members of series like “The Bear,” “The White Lotus” and “The Last of Us,” all of which received multiple Emmy nominations, are among those in attendance.See below for some of the night’s red carpet looks. The gallery will update throughout the event.
