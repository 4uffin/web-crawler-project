Keaton Jennings and Liam Livingstone are the only two batsman to get the pace of this pitch for Lancashire.But Somerset have been outstanding in the field so far.

Reaches for a widish ball and dobs Ben Green to cover where Lewis Gregory takes a tumbling catch to his left.The oomph is leaving this Lancs reply and the run rate is climbing. They need over 13 per six now.

The ball also changes direction slightly after the ball passes the bat. Livingstone has every right to be upset. That's an absolute horrendous decision.Seb, WinchesterDRS showing there why Iâve always thought Hotspot is the more reliable technologyâ¦ UltraEdge is just far too unreliable and subjective.Russ, UptonSat in front of Lancs dressing room.

Just two from another tight over from Migael Pretorius and Lancs need to reset here otherwise that controversial Liam Livingstone dismissal could derail their chase.Jake Ball was expensive in his first but Lewis Gregory needs a good one from him here.

There's a clear spike there. From the size of the spike it feels like it's a hard hit between bat and ball.It feels like he probably got a tiny edge before it hit his back leg, but everything was so close - the bat, the ball, it was pretty much jammed together.That's a huge moment in this semi-final. The third umpire was in an unforgiving place, it was a hard decision to make and ultimately Liam Livingstone was given out on the field.

The impact with the bat is between frames, so it's impossible to say whether it did catch the inside edge.

Image source, Rex FeaturesControversial... and Liam Livingstone is not a happy bunny at all.A straight one from the Somerset captain, Lewis Gregory, hits him in front of middle and off and the finger goes straight up.Livingstone reviews immediately but the tech shows, in the third umpire's mind, he has missed it.In truth that is almost impossible to work out even with the benefit of snicko but that is a huge moment in the game.

That's the 100 up for Lancs in the 12th over with Craig Overton smartly stopping it coming with a boundary, tumbling at long off.

Lancashire don't want any rain at the moment, they have got the game under control.If they can keep everything going like they are, up the intensity a tad and put Somerset under pressure in the field - they won't want to take it to the 20th over.

Lewis Gregory is keeping Migael Pretorius back after his first and has turned to Ben Green for another tight over.The mulleted seamer delivers with just six off it.Liam Livingstone and Michael Jones do not look panicked by the task and certainly not trying to push it which suggests they believe that the hits will come.

It's looking pretty dark over the Raglan Stand where any showers are supposed to come from today.It might be touch and go whether we get through this chase without an interruption. Fingers crossed.

Migael Pretorius has kept the lid on things nicely with just two from the over but Michael Jones has eased it slightly ajar with an elegant four and Liam Livingstone has bullied a huge six over long off.

Image source, Getty ImagesThat's a chink of light for Somerset, that's all it is at the moment, but well played Keaton Jennings, a really impressive knock.It was great work by Tom Kohler-Cadmore. He had to make good ground to the ball and pouched it well.

Tom Kohler-Cadmore took that catch right in front of me. Stunning. He had so much ground to make up.

Good bowling from Goldsworthy, throwing it outside off knowing Jennings likes to hit over the leg side.It's a good catch and a big wicket because Jennings is a good player of spin.

Image source, PA MediaBig moment in the game you feel.Keaton Jennings is annoyed with himself as that should have gone over the long boundary but the ball has just hesitated on him and he is through the shot to send it skyward.Tom Kohler-Cadmore makes good ground from long-on gives a big call to keep Craig Overton out of the way and ends sprawled on the pink Vitality banner pinned straight behind the wicket.

It'll be interesting to see how spin reacts off this pitch now.It seems to have got better since the start.

Pace off from Ben Green and that was a good over which has stopped the bleeding. Just three off it and that should be a template for the other Somerset bowlers to follow.Spin for now with Lewis Goldsworthy into the attack

In their six-over powerplay, Lancashire have racked up 73-2. Lancashire are absolutely on top at the moment.
