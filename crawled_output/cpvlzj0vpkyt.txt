Second over for David Willey and he's short to Chris Lynn who swivels on a pull and gets it past short-fine leg for four.Lynn then clears the front dog and whacks it from length way back into the Hollies Stand - possibly the biggest blow of the day so far.Willey is then too full and Lynn gracefully strokes it through cover for four before a modicum of revenge as Willey zips a bouncer past the Australian.But a little like the start of their innings, Northants are under pressure early.

These are dangerous moments for Northants, they need to make a breakthrough. They need to find an answer.

Ben Sanderson, Northants' sole survivor from the side who won the 2016 title, opens up from the Birmingham End. Starts with two leg side wides before Chris Lynn steps to leg and bashes a length ball straight for four.Albert then lifts up and over mid-off for four before some confusion in refusing a single to cover but both survive.Good over for Hampshire.

There are some advantages for Northants here. They got some runs on the board, they're setting a target in excess of 8.5 an over and crucially perhaps their fifth bowler has to bowl three overs not four.Hampshire are favourites but this is a challenge.

Image source, ReutersA leg bye opens up the chase before Willey slides one across the right-handed Chris Lynn.But that's all Lynn needs to have a look as his second ball is whacked over long-on for six!Albert also has a straight smash at Willey but a superb save off his own bowling prevents any runs off the final delivery.

Thanks a lot.So Northants have cobbled (chortle!) together a score.Can they get back to their first final since 2016?We have a 5.2 over powerplay and David Willey has the new ball bowling to Toby Albert.

From 86-6 Northants have posted a target they will believe they can defend. Luke Procter (30) and particularly Justin Broad (61 not out) take a bow for that.Slightly bizarrely Duckworth-Lewis-Stern has reduced not increased the target from 159 to 155 on account of the fact Northants might have been bowled out over 20 overs.Still, we are in for a belting second innings chase/defence and Alex Winter is on hand to steer you through it.

That was well closed out by Hampshire and leaves a better taste in their mouths.Had Northants got 165 they would have felt they'd got a lot more than they should have.But we could have a good game on our hands.

A single to finish as Justin Broad takes an aimless swipe at a slower ball put wide outside off stump by Scott Currie.That has been a superb knock from Broad who finishes 61 not out. His partnership with Luke Procter has given the Steelbacks some hope to cling to.

Luke Procter joins the scoop-ramping club taking four off the second ball but he has been bowled taking a big swipe next ball.He has shared a 70-run partnership for the seventh wicket and he gets a deserved round of applause from the Steelbacks dugout.

Chris Wood goes for two boundaries, one nailed through mid-on and a second reverse ramped over fine leg.Good comeback from Wood who keeps it to four singles, with his last over costing 13 runs.This partnership is 65 from 37 balls.

He's completely lost that in the sun. His hands are ready and two more steps in and he takes the catch but he has no idea where it is.Sunglasses don't help. They make it glarey.

Sonny Baker sends down a slower ball and gets a mistimed bunt from Justin Broad to extra cover.The ball loops up invitingly only for James Fuller to totally lose it against the sun, the fielder pulling out of the catch and 'seeing' it bounce a yard or two in front of him.

If you thought the previous ramp was good Justin Broad has bettered it here.Sonny Baker has fired down a leg stump yorker at 88mph and Broad has angled his bat to put it over fine leg for six.Just brilliant.

Justin Broad probably goes under the radar a bit, but the Germany international averages more than 32 in T20 cricket.That's pretty decent in the format and he's playing a fine knock here.

Brilliant execution from Justin Broad as he scoops Chris Wood over fine leg for four then follows up with a whipped pull for four to bring up his own half century.it has come in 30 balls and Northants are clawing their way back into this with three overs to come.

Image source, Rex FeaturesJustin Broad has continued to put the pressure back on the bowlers and Luke Procter is very experienced.This is their final partnership but if they can manage to go at 10s for these final overs, that could give Hampshire a few problems.

An uppercut from Justin Broad off Scott Currie looks to be travelling to Sonny Baker but the fielder can't hold on, tipping it over the bar for a six.He should have taken the catch but even then he may have trodden on the rope but it is a momentum shifter for Northants.

Tidy over from Sonny Baker with just seven from it.Five to go for Northants who will still fancy they can put up a respectable score.
