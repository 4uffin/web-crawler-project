George Balderson finds the outside edge of Tom Abell first ball - and it slides straight through short-third man for four!Tom Kohler-Cadmore is then down the pitch and swings high over the leg side.It goes very high and long enough to just clear deep square for the day's first six.

That is the first ball George Balderson has bowled in the Blast this season. He has not had to do any of the heavy lifting to get here, turns up on Finals Day and takes a wicket first ball.

And the start gets better with a wicket!George Balderson at the Birmingham End and he nips one back in off a good length, through Will Smeed and into the top of middle and off.

Image source, Rex FeaturesYou can see why Lancashire have bowled first.There is a little bit of tackiness in the pitch and there might just be a little bit of seam movement. Before the end of this innings it will become a good surface but it looks a little bit stoppy.

Tom Aspinwall from the Pavilion End - and also finds some movement as well.Tom Kohler-Cadmore is beaten pushing just outside off before he ducks a bouncer.Not taking any chances and sees out a maiden.Excellent start for Lancs.

Some nibble for Jimmy Anderson. He swings one just past the outside edge of Tom Kohler-Cadmore. And the last ball nips back and takes Will Smeedâs inside edge past the wicketkeeper for four!

Image source, PA MediaAs ever with Finals Day, it's all about the fancy dress.In the Hollies Stand I've spotted four Bananas in Pyjamas, a group of Dickie Bird umpires and half a dozen guys dressed for a 90s warehouse rave.It's expected to be a sellout, and everyone's here for a party.

The schedule has often robbed Finals Day of international stars - but does it matter?A great day's cricket is almost always served up and Edgbaston is once again sold out.Have your say via WhatsApp on 03301231826 or text 81111 (UK only, standard message rates apply).

The weather has turned very autumnal recently but we're set for a pleasant day.There's the chance of an afternoon shower but generally plenty of sunshine and a gentle breeze.So we should be fine to get the three games played.(Just as well - the forecast for Sunday's reserve day is appalling!)

Image source, Getty ImagesSomerset were again imperious in the group stage with 11 wins from their 14 matches but it looked like they would be tripped up in the quarter-final.At home to Birmingham Bears, the hosts needed 19 from the final five balls before Sean Dickson hauled them over the line in four.His extraordinary innings of 71 not out in just 26 balls was his last as a Somerset player at Taunton, having been released and joined Glamorgan for next season.Can he sign off in style today?

Lancashire topped a very tight North Group with nine wins before Liam Livingstone's unbeaten 85 from 45 balls saw them past Kent in the quarter-final.But the schedule has badly worked against them and they're without a host of stars that have helped them to Finals Day and don't have an overseas player today.Jos Buttler, Saqib Mahmood, Phil Salt and Luke Wood are all with England, ahead of tomorrow's final T20 against South Africa.Australian Chris Green is at the Caribbean Premier League and another Aussie, Ashton Turner, has been recalled by Western Australia.Somerset are also affected. Tom Banton is with England, Matt Henry is back in New Zealand and Riley Meredith has returned to Australia. But they do have South African allrounder Migael Pretorius.
