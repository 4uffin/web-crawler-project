Another leg side swipe brings six more!Can he complete the set?No! He misses with another swing to leg.He's given out lbw! But surely outside off?Yes. Chris Lynn reviews and he's way outside off.

Chris Lynn's got three consecutive sixes, he's got there from just 49 balls.The highest score on Finals day.The first time a man has got 100 on Finals Day.What a knock it's been.

Lloyd Pope also now to bowl out.And Chris Lynn whacks the first ball over cow corner for six!Lynn could win the game himself if this carries on. Seven sixes now.And next ball he slog-sweeps into the Hollies Stand!He goes again! Top edge! But it's into the bleachers again! Three bombs on the spin.And one more, flat over square leg, to bring up the first hundred on Finals Day!

The equation for me is more than manageable. I can't understand that option from Ali Orr or quite a few of the Hampshire batters really.Surely at this stage it's all about giving Chris Lynn as much of the strike as possible.

Superb spell from Saif Zaib, 3-18 from his four, to give his side a chance.But Northants must get Chris Lynn out.

Saif Zaib with his final over.Two singles to open up before Chris Lynn slaps to extra cover and swings flat down to long-on for a single.Ali Orr then slog-sweeps but straight to deep-square! Ravi Bopara with the catch in front of the Hollies Stand.

Ben Sanderson is back and sends down two yorkers for two dots.But then one slips out of his hand and a shoulder-high full toss gets whacked for six over mid-wicket by Chris Lynn!Oh, what a pressure release. No-ball six.Free hit now... and Lynn pans him into the Hollies for six more!A leg bye to fine leg for one before a single to end the over.17 from it and Hampshire are running again.

I guess the question for Chris Lynn is weighing up that risk reward.Does he try and hit one over the top and things might sway back into Hampshire's favour but does he want to risk that?

Ali Orr is the new man. Reverse sweeps and misses first ball before taking a single in front of point.Chris Lynn then dabs wide of long-on and they scramble a second before a single closes out the 12th.

Ben Mayes made decent contact with it but the height meant that there was always a bit of a risk.Saif Zaib gets the breakthrough.

Lloyd Pope with a third over and Chris Lynn sweeps two into a leg-side gap before driving a single to long-off.Ben Mayes reverse sweeps straight to short third man, paddle sweeps for two, fine on the leg side, and tries again, gets it finer, and finds the fence!Important boundary.

So Lancashire werenât allowed to play Salt, Jos and Wood who featured at OT last night. Yet Hampshire were allowed to use Bjorn Fortuin who was a member of the South Africa side in the same game?AnonPlease add your name to your messages.

Bopara trying to atone and he keeps cramping up the right-handers.Chris Lynn cuts a single before Ben Mayes drives another down the ground.Just another cut single to close the over and now 72 are needed from 48 balls.
