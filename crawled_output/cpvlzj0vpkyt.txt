Bjorn Fortuin returns with another testing over.He gives up a couple to Sean Dickson then scrambles across the track to slide and prevent a single - he's a super trouper.He beats the bat and hits Sean Dickson's pad in front from the next ball, though Dickson was way down the track and the Hawks opt not to review Michael Gough's not out call - even though it appeared to have straightened and be heading for leg stump.Just four off the over, just what Hampshire needed.BENNY TAKES OVER FROM BJORN... Gimme, Gimme, Gimme the ball, he almost certainly said.

That's Scott Currie in a nutshell. He can make things happen out of nothing.I'm pretty sure it's not the delivery he would have wanted but he'll take that.

Sean Dickson ducks under the first delivery from Scott Currie and then can't get a slower ball away.Five runs off the over and that big wicket.Midway point and Somerset need 105 from 10 overs.

Image source, ReutersScott Currie produces a slower ball which James Rew caresses, that's the only word I can use, with soft hands for a four.BUT HE GOES NEXT BALL, dragging on a full toss from outside off. Not pretty, but effective.A stroke of luck for Currie but a huge breakthrough for Hampshire as Rew looked set.Sean Dickson is the new batter. The game is entering a decisive phase, one way or another...

Will Smeed really is the key batter for Somerset. They have power hitting to come but he's got to anchor this chase from a Somerset perspective.
195Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 9 overs9 oversSomerset 85-2 - target 195 to beat Hampshire
Good stuff from South African spinner Bjorn Fortuin, conceding two runs from his first four balls, but Will Smeed makes room to whip him back down the ground to long-on for four and then picks up a useful two with a carve to deep point from the final ball.Eight off the over in the end. This is getting mighty interesting...

James Fuller serves up Will Smeed a low full toss on leg stump which he gleefully accepts, clipping away for four runs to move to 33* from 23 deliveries.Fuller responds with a dot ball then a shorter one which is pulled just shy of the deep mid-wicket fielder for a single.James Rew swivels to pull another short one past the diving fielder at long leg to move to 13* from five balls but gets lucky with one which drops safely between to fielders in the off-side from the final ball.Again it's 11 off the over. Somerset are keeping up with the rate, you know...Smeed has 34* with Rew 15* from seven.Bjorn Fortuin is coming into the attack. BENNY Howell and BJORN Fortuin in the same attack... ABBA fans will love it.And the winner takes it all tonight...

Benny Howell continues to smother the batters, allowing three singles in four balls.However, James Rew lofts the ball through vacant mid-wicket for a precious boundary and then gets another as Ali Orr slides into the ball near the rope and deflects it with his knee like a celebrating footballer.11 off the over. James Fuller will return.

James Rew misses the final ball from James Fuller.Hampshire will feel they have taken a big stride in the past few minutes with Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Tom Abell sent packing.Much rests on the shoulders of Will Smeed who is 26* from 19, with James Rew going to need to stick with him for a while. Sean Dickson, in his final T20 appearance for Somerset, might have his eyes on the headlines too, of course.Benny Howell will take over the bowling. The momentum is with them.

Image source, ReutersTom Abell looked good in the semis, he got a good 20-odd but 20-odds are not going to win you titles and he's gone for a duck.That is a big blow. Two wickets in quick time as well.The top three had to produce here. Two haven't, Will Smeed is still going.James Rew has had a pretty quiet quarters and semi, maybe this is the time he can step up? He's capable, he's a very talented young man.

Will Smeed cracks the first ball from James Fuller uppishly past point for a four, and he makes it back-to-back boundaries with a cut to backward point.James Fuller responds with a better, straighter ball before straying onto leg and giving up a single to deep mid-wicket thanks to smart fielding from Scott Currie.Ball five is clipped to deep square by Tom Abell where Ben Mayes runs around to make the catch inside the rope to send Abell packing for no score.James Rew is the next man in the middle.

Five runs and the wicket of Tom Kohler-Cadmore. Sonny Baker's had worse overs.Good recovery after a hair-raising start.James Fuller will bowl the final over of the powerplay.Will Smeed has 18* from 15 balls with Tom Abell nought from one.

Quick, straight, perfect. Beats the swing of TKC and smashes the stumps. Breakthrough.Tom Abell is the new man in.

Scott Currie has been tossed the ball, having had success against Somerset already this season.TKC welcomes him with a glorious late uppercut which flies over the rope at backward point for six. He's seeing it like a beachball today.Currie responds by mixing up his speeds and lengths but TKC moves to 19* from eight balls with a couple past mid-wicket before two dot balls.10 off the fourth over. Sonny Baker will take the next.
