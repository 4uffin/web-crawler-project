Hampshire skipper James Vince told Sky Sports: It was a brilliant game, brilliant day all round. Somerset have been quality throughout and were too good for us tonight."We played some really good cricket but unfortunately we came up just short."We're disappointed not to get the trophy for our coach Adi Birrell who is leaving after seven years."Somerset are always a tough game. They have been awesome throughout and are deserved winners tonight."You could argue we could have another 20 runs but then they managed to find the boundary when they needed it."We just did not quite have enough in the end."

Will Smeed, Toby Albert, Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Chris Lynn have played some of the finest T20 innings I've seen today.The ball-striking, the reverse ramps, the straight hitting... absolutely wonderful.What a treat.

Somerset batter Sean Dickson told Sky Sports: "Will Smeed was special. He's worked so hard for this at all these Finals Days and he's finally got his big one. "Lewis Gregory, 18 off that over is something ridiculous. I am very proud of the guys."It's that self-belief, trust the process, I am really proud of the guys. It's a really special day, a remarkable day in the calendar."

That was Somerset's eighth T20 final, and their third win after triumphs in 2005
and 2023.As for Hampshire, they had won all three previous finals they had been in, in 2010, 2012 and 2022.No team has been to more Finals Days than these two sides and no side has won more than their three titles.This is a bit of revenge for Somerset's defeat by Hampshire in that 2010 final and means each side have now won three of their six Finals Day meetings down the years.It might be a touch awkward on Monday, however... Hampshire visit Somerset for a four-day County Championship game at Taunton starting at 10:30 BST.

"It's amazing to win a trophy for the fans and put right what we did wrong last year (losing the final to Gloucestershire)."

An almighty six over long-on. Couldn't have middled that any better.The poor ball needs some TLC after that.Six runs needed to win...A dot ball from Currie calms the crowd a little BUT THE NEXT BALL IS CLIPPED DEEP OVER MID-WICKET FOR SIX.Lewis Gregory steers his side to glory with 18* from just five balls.Sean Dickson ends 33* in his final T20 appearance for the club.An historic chase, completed with six balls to spare.Somerset have equalled Hampshire and Leicestershire as three-time T20 Blast winners.Their legacy is complete.

That was a great bit of cricket equally from the batter because Will Smeed has hit that hard, he's unlucky but James Vince has done a terrific job there in holding his nerve and holding that catch.Hampshire are not out of the woods because Lewis Gregory is a top, top player.

Will Smeed moves into the 90s with a four to deep mid-wicket, his 14th, to go with a six, off the first ball of Benny Howell's final over.Sean Dickson gets his timing absolutely perfect with a reverse paddle for six and you have to think Somerset are on top now. Hampshire need a wicket asap.81 runs from 48 balls these two have put on.Smeed returns to the strike on 93* but is limited to a single by Scott Currie at deep mid-wicket.The final ball... IS ABSOLUTELY WALLOPED over deep mid-wicket by Sean Dickson for six.19 off the over. Somerset's to lose, surely?Scott Currie bowls the 19th.

Will Smeed is the key. Even Sean Dickson, he's played one good scoop shot but Smeed has looked perfectly fluent for the entirety of the innings.He's really held this together and at the moment you'd feel as though he has to be there if Somerset are to chase this.

The pressure is showing now, Scott Currie returns but slings down a wide to start his third over.A drive down the ground from Will Smeed takes him into the 80s but Currie gets away with another wide-looking one from ball four.The fifth is a MONSTER slog sweep for six into the Hollies from Smeed over deep square. His first six.He has 88* from 54 balls after cracking a short ball to deep cover for just a single.Dot ball to end the over, how crucial might it prove. Sean Dickson has 20*.11 off the over.How are the nerves? Good night to be a neutral I reckon.

Sonny Baker returns and Sean Dickson ramps his slower ball over Chris Wood at short third for four, which brings up the 50-stand with Will Smeed.Dickson takes a single to deep mid-wicket from the next ball bringing Smeed back on strike but Baker produces a timely dot ball before a yorker on leg stump costs only a single.Dickson cracks the next ball back over Baker for four to long-off.11 off the over.Somerset have this in their grasp.

Sheer pain.How costly will it be?Nine off the over from Benny, but that could have been Somerset's Waterloo, surely?
