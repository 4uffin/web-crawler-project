Tom Kohler-Cadmore is in the mood for damage now.He takes the first ball from Jack Blatherwick, a low full-toss, down the ground for four.A short ball heading down leg is helped over short-fine leg for four more before he gives himself room and swings freely over extra-cover for another boundary!More room outside leg and he cuts up and over short-third man. Four more!Two singles ends a big over for Somerset. 18 from.

Tom Aspinwall back into the attack and Tom Kohler-Cadmore drives to extra-cover where there's another little fumble in the field.They take a quick single and TK-C needs to dive to make his ground.Aspinwall was too far from the non-striker's stumps and had to take two trips to the bails - that was the difference. Could have been a big run-out.He follows up with wides either side of the stumps.Lewis Gregory is struggling to get going. He swings and misses aiming leg side before a lofty drive short of deep point brings two.Finally finds some timing as he steps across to scoop the last ball over short-fine leg for four.

The pitch has a tufty sort of look to it and the groundsman has obviously left a little bit of grass on it. Underneath the surface looks quite dry and it can spin if it hits those tufts but more importantly the pace of the two spinners has been key for me.Liam Livingstone has been prepared to give the ball a bit of flight and get the batters coming forward and run the risk that they might dong him over the top.

Tom Hartley's final over.And he misfields first ball to give up a cheap single - Lancashire haven't been bomb-proof so far in the field.Tom Kohler-Cadmore comes down again and swings hard straight down town for six!Hartley then forced wide of off stump - too wide.A single and a dot ends a more expensive over but still a very fine spell from Hartley - four overs, 1-24.

Tom Kohler-Cadmore became a new dad last month.I remember those sleepless nights well... how he is smashing the ball to all parts of Edgbaston I have no idea!You can read more about a fantastic cause the Somerset batter is raising awareness of here.Image source, PA Media

Livingstone gets out of the over fairly well with singles but that six means a better over for Somerset.Six overs to go.

That stand was just beginning to simmer away but Tom Hartley breaks the partnership and Lancashire are really on top now.Two from the set and a wicket.

You get a good view of the Birmingham skyline in the media box and there are some menacing clouds starting to build up to the west.They need to stay away from Edgbaston because this first semi-final is superbly poised.

A second over for Liam Livingstone - and Sean Dickson comes down the wicket to push two between deep midwicket and long-on.Tries another dab-and-go leg side but this time just a single.A good save at backward points means just another single before Tom Kohler-Cadmore uses his feet to take two wide of deep cover.

Definitely from here Somerset wil be wanting 150 minimum but Tom Kohler-Cadmore is looking to be the key to that.I don't think they need to set their stall out too high, but I think 150 as a minimum if these two can get in and get a partnership going.They haven't really got one going yet but these two are looking good and set.

No flight offered so far by Tom Hartley and he's again worked around for singles - before a second poor piece of fielding of the innings.A punch goes straight through Keaton Jennings at extra-cover and they take two that should have been a dot.The batters content to just knock it for ones though and it's another calm over.

More spin now with Liam Livingstone and Sean Dickson sweeps him superbly out to the Hollies Stand for four, picking the gap between deep-backward square and deep midwicket.Just singles otherwise though as we reach halfway.Who are the happier team?

Having taken that catch, Tom Hartley is now on for some left-arm spin.Worked for singles, Sean Dickson then comes down the pitch, blocks out to point, is sent back with no single on offer and the wicketkeeper tries - unnecessarily - to run him out and gives up an overthrow.Great start for Hartley.

Image source, PA MediaLancashire you feel are just beginning to build a bit of pressure. Somerset were not getting those boundaries away and you felt they were getting a little bit agitated.It was a bit of a shame. It is the first real time I've had a look at this new south-paw James Rew but I've heard a lot about him. He was trying to break out and didn't quite time it.

So here's Sean Dickson - is this his final knock for Somerset?Two leg-side wides fom Aspinwall before Dickson is off the mark with a tuck to leg.

Tom Aspinwall's second over - his first was a maiden.Tom Kohler-Cadmore works a single to deep square before James Rew tries to clip a ball leg side and is taken low at short-midwicket!Smart catch from Tom Hartley.

Had they not taken the wicket [of Tom Abell] I would have said Somerset were slightly ahead but Lancashire will be very, very pleased they have taken that wicket there.They have got rid of a very dangerous player who could hurt you as the game goes on.It looks as though the pitch is getting better and the tackiness is wearing off making it slightly easier to hit through the line of the ball. So while both teams will be reasonably happy with where they are at but this is the opportunity for Lancashire Lightning to squeeze now.
