Somerset's Tom Kohler-Cadmore speaking to BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra:"We spoke about someone being man of the match and getting us through and thankfully that was me."They got off to such a good start and a few boundaries at the end could have hurt us."But we've got great vibes now heading into the final and there's some unfinished business from last year."

Lancashire captain Keaton Jennings speaking to BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra:"Overall they were they better side on the day and we fell a little short with bat, ball and in the field."It feels like a harsh decision to retire George [Balderson] but we felt like Tommy [Hartley] had a better chance to hit a couple of sixes."

Lancashire will be hurting after that. At the halfway point in the run chase the game was theirs to lose. They had the game under control and didn't have to do anything drastic.They were ahead of the run rate but with both ball and the bat that little bit of inexperience and that little bit of lack of composure in the critical moments meant they have come up well short.

The bananas and bandits are now huddled together at the back of the Hollies Stand under the roof.The rain does appear to be stopping but it'll take a while to clear things up.

So frustrating to see that Lancashire don't get to play their strongest team in the biggest day of the season. No Salt, Buttler, Mahmood, Green and Wood. The ECB scheduling team needs sacking.Calum in Braintree (a very bitter Lancashire fan)

The out-cricket was excellent from Somerset. They just need to have a little chat about what they're going to do in the powerplay because they were taken down.They went for 73 and they have got to have a thought process to stop that happening again.You feel for Lancashire as they had three key players out, Somerset had three out as well but you can only play what's in front of you. It was a decent game of cricket.

The rain is torrential and the full covers are on. I think it'll be a passing shower, but the second semi-final between Northants and Hampshire will definitely be delayed.

Overall it was a great game.Your heart goes out to Lancashire with their selection issues but they went about their chase manfully with a young squad.But Somerset showed their experience of big finals and once they got past 160 you wondered how Lancashire would get past that.

And that is that.Somerset are through to the final later on as a heave to the leg side by Tom Aspinwall lands safely in Craig Overton's bucket hands.It is an eighth T20 Final for Somerset and Lancashire have a bit of a post-mortem to conduct.Liam Livingstone's dismissal (controversial as it was) is one talking point but also the retiring of George Balderson late on was a poor decision.

Good catch in the deep by Craig Overton.A big hit but not quite enough as the Somerset man just stays inside the ropes at long on.

This game is a ball away from being up for Lancs.Migael Pretorius has the ball in hand and has given up a four with his first delivery.

And that is what happens when you try to be too clever by half.Tom Hartley is subbed in for George Balderson and then goes first ball, straight down long off's throat.

I can't understand that decision.And I feel sorry for Balderson. He was doing fine and had a chance to win a game for his club.

It's gone so dark. Are they going to finish this innings before the heavens open?

George Balderson has been subbed (retired out) with Tom Hartley coming on for the final hits.Not sure about that.

As if Lancs didn't have it tough anyway with half a team missing, then you get a decision like that. Some finals day. Farce.Tim

Jake Ball has bowled a very good over with pace off very much on the menu.He has mixed it up and George Balderson can't quite time anything perfectly with just seven off it.Michael Jones is on strike and this, you feel, is the match.

Somerset are still not in control because of that no-ball six and the free-hit six. The wicket is important but so is the dot ball and it brings a new batter in. It's not easy for a new guy to come in and strike straight away.

If anyone is going to get Lancashire up here, Michael Jones has to be the man now.
