They shouldn't be off for too long. I can already see blue sky to the west.

The players are off and the covers are on but the sun is out and a rainbow stretches artfully across the sky behind the Hollies Stand.All very confusing but the fact the groundstaff have stayed out near the hovercover suggests they could be back on soon.Apparently the match is losing overs from now.Image source, Gary Smee

Northants have played the situation, said 'we can't consolidate' and have tried to put some pressure back on Hampshire.But those three early wickets have really done the damage.

That could be very important.Lewis McManus nudges to mid-off and sets off to nick a quick single.James Vince picks and throws with a stump and a half to aim at and scores a direct hit.At first sight McManus looks home but replays show his bat is half an inch short of grounding in the crease.That could be a big help for Hampshire if we lose overs.

Rain is coming in at the halfway stage and the skies are looking ominous.Five wickets down is a bad situation for Northants with regard to any Duckworth-Lewis-Stern calculations should we lose overs.

Image source, PA MediaNice grab by Ali Orr on the deep mid-wicket boundary and Northants are in a world of trouble here. Saif Zaib makes a good connection with a hefty sweep but it is too aerial and Orr, fielding in front of the Hollies Stand, takes a decent catch mid dive.The TV umpire checks that he has not grounded it as he hits the turf but it all looks good.

Can we take a minute to look at the tiny cricket powerhouse school that is King's College, Taunton. In today's finals day alumni include James Rew, Will Smeed and Sonny Baker but on top of this are Tom Banton, Jos Butler, Calvin Harrison, Thomas Rew, Will Smale, Nathan Gilchrist to name but a few. Their alumni squad would do a pretty good job on finals day! Come on Somerset!AnonRemember to pop your name on your messages.

South Africa's Bjorn Fortuin was getting smacked all over Old Trafford less than 24 hours ago - although his figures of 2-52 were by no means the most expensive!It might be a more chilled one at Edgbaston this afternoon. The clouds are rolling in again though...

Fantastic bowling. He's varied his pace really well and that was held back and went on with the arm.Northants are going to have to play very well from here to set something challenging.

Bjorn Fortuin has absolutely done Tim Robinson all ends up.The South Africa spinner drags it down as the Northants batter advances to try and clip into the leg side but it beats the outside of his bat and hits off stump.

Justin Broad might not have timed this perfectly with a slightly ceramic sounding ping off the bat but finds the boundary at deep mid-wicket as James Fuller finishes his first over.It is 50 for the loss of three from the powerplay which is most definitely advantage Hampshire.Plenty of time to yank things back in their favour but the Steelbacks could do with a partnership between Broad and Tim Robinson.

Re Kieran (15:34) - it is! Quarter-finals had four from North and four from the South. Finals day has two from North group and two from Southâ¦ embrace the North in Northamptonshire.Tim

Image source, Getty ImagesHuge blow for Northants as they lose the main man.Sonny Baker is generating some heat and Ravi Bopara is beaten for pace, swinging hard and edging to short third where Chris Wood takes the catch in front of his face.Wood looked to have lost that in the sun but it stuck and that could be a big breakthrough.

Ramp for four from Ricardo Vasconcelos as he steers Scott Currie for four to fine leg but a second attempt at the same shot does for him.There is a decent connection but it is just too high up the bat and he scoops it up to short fine leg where Chris Wood takes a simple catch running back.Image source, Getty Images

The wicket has been under cover and there is a little but in it.But you've just got to hang in there like Somerset did. The wicket will get better and you've got to give yourselves a chance.

Down at Edgbaston for finals day which is electric as per. Just wish they would split the play-offs into North and South meaning the finals would always be north v south rather than the finals day being dominated by the south. Gives us northerners something to get behind rather than a predominantly southern day!Kieran from Leeds
