Those couple of sixes from Toby Albert were as clean as anything Chris Lynn struck in the semi-final.I didn't think I'd be saying that such was the brilliance of Lynn's striking.

Toby Albert, that's huge. Chris Lynn eat your heart out.For me, Toby Albert is the most-improved T20 player in the Hampshire team.

After Toby Albert misses another ramp shot to start the over, Migael Pretorius sends down a low full toss which is flicked away for four to fine leg.The third ball is smashed into the second deck of the stands over wide long-on for a monster six which brings up the Hawks' 50.There's another, this time over deep mid-wicket, again no footwork needed when you can swing like that.And another... he's found his groove and the ramp shot finally comes off, over the rope for a maximum.And a four finishes the over... 25 from it, Albert has 37* from 14 balls.

This has been a good start for Hampshire, but it's not a dominating start yet.

Toby Albert clips a single off Jake Ball's first delivery but James Vince has to defend a length ball before giving a slightly shorter ball the treatment over cow corner for his second six.A swing and a miss draws a precious dot ball for Ball before Vince manages to scamper a single ahead of Lewis Gregory's underarm throw from mid-off.An Albert single makes it nine off the over and keeps him on strike. Vince has 15*, two more than Albert.Migael Pretorius will bowl the fifth over.

Chris Lynn's gone, but it's time for one of the other Hampshire batters to step up.They didn't have a huge amount to do in the semi-final... James Vince was the second highest scorer in their 155-4 with 12!

Good start to the over from Craig Overton, following up the precious wicket with a couple of good balls which only go for singles.However James Vince times one beautifully on his hips to clip a flat six to long leg and Hampshire end up with eight runs off the over.Jake Ball will take over the bowling.

That's a big blow from Craig Overton, you could see the delight from the Somerset fielders.You sense maybe a touch of fatigue potentially from Chris Lynn. He played a phenomenal knock in the semi-final but it looked a little bit of a tired shot which you can understand, it does take it out of you.

Image source, PA MediaNo repeat of Chris Lynn's fireworks as he skews the first ball of Craig Overton's over into the sky and Lewis Goldsworthy takes a routine catch, with Tom Kohler-Cadmore almost crashing into him.Lynn was not moving comfortably, it must be said, and there was no footwork there, that was all biceps, trying for the rope every time.James Vince is the new batter.

Chris Lynn is picking up where he left off in the second semi-final.You wouldn't bet against that being the first of several.

Toby Albert hasn't quite found his timing yet and clips to mid-wicket for a single to move to three.Lynn shuffles across his crease and flashes a huge drive which loops backward of point and all the way to the rope for four.A single brings Albert back onto strike and he slams a length ball to the long-off rope for four, which makes him the leading scorer in this competition this year... until Tom Kohler-Cadmore has a crack later, at least.Another lovely lofted drive over the covers finds the fence and moves Albert to 11, one behind Lynn.

Image source, ReutersCraig Overton sends down a wide from the first ball of the over, which Toby Albert shapes to ramp. Straight into the thick of the action.A leg-side single brings Chris Lynn onto strike but he blocks the first ball to mid-on before miscuing the next ball back to the bowler.A single to short-leg gets him off strike but he doesn't look nearly as fluent as he did earlier.In fact he limps through for a single from Albert.Best thing to do is wallop the next ball over the bowler's head for six, which is exactly what Lynn does.Don't need to run if you can do that.Skipper Lewis Gregory will take the second over for Somerset.

Toby Albert, who needs just four runs to take over as the leading run-scorer in the competition from D'Arcy Short of Gloucestershire and Chris Lynn, he of the 108* from 51 balls a little earlier, head out to the middle...Nearly time for the 2025 Blast Final.History will be made... but for whom?

Blue skies over Birmingham at present.The weather radar shows a couple of small rain clouds heading in from the west, but hopefully nothing to worry about in the next hour at least.Fingers crossed we get a full game, and a memorable one...

It's going to be a cracker, very much looking forward to what we're going to see.Off the back of winning that second semi-final will Hampshire take that momentum in or will Somerset be able reset after going back to the hotel and chilling for a few hours?It's going to be a fascinating contest.

After potentially playing his final game in English cricket, Ravi Bopara speaking on BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra: "From the start of the game we knew there was a bit of rain around and all that sort of stuff but we set ourselves to go out and play the same way we did against Surrey. Go after the game and I thought we put a good total on the board, it was a decent total on that wicket which is slowing up a little bit."We thought we had the game, it was in the balance with six overs to go and then there was the one big over and we end up losing the game but I thought Chris Lynn played unbelievable. When someone has a day out like that it's hard to stop them."Sorry to the supporters we didn't go on, lightning doesn't strike twice. We had a great game against Surrey and we really did have visions of us going all the way this year but sometimes Finals Day is a lottery and one guy gets you and it's done."On his future."It's not the ideal game to finish on but I've not made a decision yet. I'm going to take some time out. It's certainly not a decision that I want to rush because it's a big decision so I want to going to take my time. I'll speak to David Willey over the next few weeks, months probably. I've got some cricket to play in Canada so let's give it until Christmas at least."

These two have also met in the final before, at the Rose Bowl in 2010, and my goodness was it dramatic...Craig Kieswetter's blistering 71 was the highlight of Somerset's 173-6.Neil McKenzie's quickfire 52 kept the hosts - then known as the Royals - on track but it was an unbeaten 44 from Sean Ervine which got them to parity, reaching 173-5 and winning by virtue of losing fewer wickets.We'd settle for similar drama tonight, wouldn't we?
