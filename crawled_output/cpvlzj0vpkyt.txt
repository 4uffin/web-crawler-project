Great running allows Benny Howell two runs from green's first ball before he smashes the next deep into the stand past the long-on rope.He didn't need to move a muscle outside of his arms and shoulders.A slower ball beats the bat for a useful dot for Green and then a full ball on leg costs just a single as Howell reaches 25* from 18 balls.Ben Mayes paddles the next ball, a shorter, slower one, to the rope in Toby Albert-fashion, getting it past Jake Ball at short third.14 off the over, useful runs for Hampshire.175 is the highest chase in the history of the Blast.Somerset will have to beat it.Benny Howell on strike for the final over from Jake Ball.

These are the real pressure moments now.Can Somerset keep Hampshire under 200 and physiologically keep themselves in the game?

Tom Abell does well to get his left hand down to deny Benny Howell a boundary after almost over-running the ball.Ben Mayes gets off the mark with a couple of singles while Howell moves to 16 from 14 balls as he skies one just short of Abell in the deep.Just six runs off the over, and a wicket. Gregory ends with 1-29 from four overs.Great recovery from Somerset. Ben Green will bowl the penultimate over.

It's been a great knock by Toby Albert, really good work.Very well bowled by Lewis Gregory. He's very experienced, he's done quite well over the years for Somerset in all formats.

Lewis Gregory bowls his first ball on the top of off stump, Toby Albert steps away to cut away but is fooled by the pace off and sees his bails go flying.85 from 48 balls and some superb shots. The leading scorer in this year's competition.Ben Mayes, the 17-year-old, is the new batter. No pressure, lad.

Another unorthodox reverse from Toby Albert brings a boundary to third off the opening ball of Jake Ball's third over and he picks up a couple from the next ball to move to 80*.ANOTHER boundary to that third man boundary follows from a low full toss on leg stump before a very short and slow ball from Ball limits him to a single.Benny Howell middles one over deep square for six, though Sean Dickson was inches away from a spectacular catch on the rope, just running out of room.17 come off the over as Albert sends Howell back from a single as he wants strike. He is on 85* from 47 balls.

Image source, PA MediaToby Albert moves to 65* from 40 balls with a single off Ben Green before Benny Howell picks up a couple to reach 6* from eight deliveries.The fourth ball is full and on middle stump but Albert adjusts incredibly to keep his balance and clip away over backward point for a boundary.He follows it up with another reverse off a yorker which finds the rope again, much to Green's disgust.A single off the last ball make it 13 off the over, just what the Hawks wanted.Albert has 74* from 43.

Lewis Gregory beats the bat of Toby Albert to start his third over.A couple of singles follow before Benny Howell sets off tentatively for a single off the bat of Albert and is fortunate to see the throw flash past the stumps with him struggling to make his ground.Four off the Gregory over and Hampshire are 31-2 off the past 31 balls.They have been pegged back superbly.

Somerset are just clawing their way back into this game but there is still a long way to go.

A fine sliding stop from Craig Overton saves three runs at the deep mid-wicket boundary - those have really dried up in the middle overs, credit to the Somerset bowlers for that.That's six off the over and Lewis Goldsworthy finishes with 1-28 off his four overs.The run-rate was about 14 at one stage, it's now nearly nine an over.

It felt like something was going to give with these two, they were getting increasingly frustrated with the way that Somerset were bowling.The way that Somerset have bowled since the powerplay - although it will be frustrating for the Hampshire batters now - their bowlers should be watching this and learning about what to implement in the second innings on this surface.
