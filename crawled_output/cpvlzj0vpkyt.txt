Hampshire make three changes from the side which beat Durham in the quarter final.Sonny Baker, Bjorn Fortuin and Ali Orr are in and Hilton Cartwright, Brad Wheal and Liam Dawson make way.Northants stick with the same XI who got past Surrey in their quarter final.

The initial announcement said the game had been reduced to 19 overs, but they've bumped it back up to 20 a side.It's going to be a long day - I didn't need to start thinking about a 5.4 over Powerplay!

It's 20 overs a side and James Vince has won the toss and decided to bowl on account of the possibility of a bit of weather around later.Northants will not be too bothered with that decision as of the nine matches they have won in this competition, they have won eight batting first.

Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Ravi Bopara posted a century in the quarter-finalNorthants enter this second semi-final as underdogs but appear happy enough in that role after upsetting similar odds against Surrey in their quarter-final.Former England old boy Ravi Bopara, now 40 and old enough to have played in the inaugural T20 competition (then the Twenty20 Cup) back in 2003, was pivotal to that seven-run victory.His 105 from 46 balls rolled back the years and put Surrey on the backfoot from where they never recovered.The Steelbacks, who have won this twice in 2013 and 2016, have been cannily led by David Willey throughout the tournament.And in Ben Sanderson and George Scrimshaw (26 wickets each) they have two of the Blastâs leading bowlers.What they will not have is Matt Breetzke, the hard-hitting South Africa batter who they hoped would be available for Finals Day but has returned home for personal reasons.Coach Darren Lehmann admitted that was âbad newsâ but captain Willey is confident they have the firepower to cover."Three games, Edgbaston, one of the best atmospheres in the world, and it is a special place to go and play,â said Willey. âHopefully the weather stays fair and we can go there and do something special.â

Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, James Vince leads out his Hampshire HawksHampshire are making a record equalling 11th appearance at Finals Day (a record they share with Somerset) but no one in the Hawks dressing room is banking on past history.Three times when they have made the final they have won it, but the Hawks have also experienced the agony of seven losing semi-finals.Despite being the bookies' favourites to progress to a fifth final, bowler Chris Wood conceded the form book can go out of the window in the heat of the Blast finale.Wood told BBC South Today âTwo of those three finals have come down to the last ball. We like to put on a crazy game of cricket, hopefully it isn't as crazy as that at the weekend and we can get to the final.âOpeners Toby Albert, Chris Lynn and Hilton Cartwright were instrumental in getting Hampshire to Edgbaston with half-centuries in the quarter-final against Durham, a match they won by 26 runs.But plenty of responsibility falls on captain Vinceâs shoulders with the now Dubai-based freelance cricketer hoping to add to his 463 runs in the tournament so far.

With one semi-final out of the way, let's start to look ahead to the second between Northants and Hampshire, even if the start is going to be delayed.If we can get started by 15:00 BST then we will still have 20 overs side - if not then we're looking at a reduced game.

Somerset's Tom Kohler-Cadmore speaking to BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra:"We spoke about someone being man of the match and getting us through and thankfully that was me."They got off to such a good start and a few boundaries at the end could have hurt us."But we've got great vibes now heading into the final and there's some unfinished business from last year."

Lancashire captain Keaton Jennings speaking to BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra:"Overall they were they better side on the day and we fell a little short with bat, ball and in the field."It feels like a harsh decision to retire George [Balderson] but we felt like Tommy [Hartley] had a better chance to hit a couple of sixes."

Lancashire will be hurting after that. At the halfway point in the run chase the game was theirs to lose. They had the game under control and didn't have to do anything drastic.They were ahead of the run rate but with both ball and the bat that little bit of inexperience and that little bit of lack of composure in the critical moments meant they have come up well short.

So frustrating to see that Lancashire don't get to play their strongest team in the biggest day of the season. No Salt, Buttler, Mahmood, Green and Wood. The ECB scheduling team needs sacking.Calum in Braintree (a very bitter Lancashire fan)

The out-cricket was excellent from Somerset. They just need to have a little chat about what they're going to do in the powerplay because they were taken down.They went for 73 and they have got to have a thought process to stop that happening again.You feel for Lancashire as they had three key players out, Somerset had three out as well but you can only play what's in front of you. It was a decent game of cricket.

The rain is torrential and the full covers are on. I think it'll be a passing shower, but the second semi-final between Northants and Hampshire will definitely be delayed.

Overall it was a great game.Your heart goes out to Lancashire with their selection issues but they went about their chase manfully with a young squad.But Somerset showed their experience of big finals and once they got past 160 you wondered how Lancashire would get past that.

And that is that.Somerset are through to the final later on as a heave to the leg side by Tom Aspinwall lands safely in Craig Overton's bucket hands.It is an eighth T20 Final for Somerset and Lancashire have a bit of a post-mortem to conduct.Liam Livingstone's dismissal (controversial as it was) is one talking point but also the retiring of George Balderson late on was a poor decision.

Good catch in the deep by Craig Overton.A big hit but not quite enough as the Somerset man just stays inside the ropes at long on.
