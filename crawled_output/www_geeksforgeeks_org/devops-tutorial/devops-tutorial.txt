DevOps is a combination of two words: "Development" and "Operations." It’s a modern approach where software developers and software operations teams work together throughout the entire software life cycle.The goals of DevOps are:Faster and continuous software releases.Reduces manual errors through automation.Built-in Monitoring, detect failures or issues during delivery or in production.Automate testing throughout the software delivery process.Before DevOps, software delivery was slow and manual. Separate teams handled coding, server setup, testing, and deployment, leading to delays and frequent errors due to lack of automation.With DevOps, the process is fast, automated, and collaborative. Using tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, teams can build, test, and deploy code continuously, enabling deployment in hours instead of days.1. Understanding DevOps Fundamentals In this section, we will cover the basic DevOps fundamentals and terminologies that are essential for a DevOps engineer. DevOps IntroductionDevOps Prerequisites Lifecycle of DevOps 2. Linux for DevOpsLinux is one of the most widely used operating systems for servers and cloud environment.
