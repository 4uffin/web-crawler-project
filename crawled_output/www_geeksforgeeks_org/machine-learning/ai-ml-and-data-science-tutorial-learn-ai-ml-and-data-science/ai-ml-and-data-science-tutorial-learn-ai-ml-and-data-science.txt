This article covers everything you need to learn about AI, ML and Data Science, starting with Python programming, statistics and probability. It also includes EDA, visualization, ML, deep learning, AI, projects and interview questions for career preparation.1. Learning PythonPython is one of the most popular programming languages today, known for its simplicity, extensive features and library support. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly, while its libraries and frameworks makes it perfect for developers.Python Tutorial Python QuizzesPython Interview Questions2. Math For Data ScienceMath for Data Science is all about the fundamental mathematical tools and concepts you need to work effectively with data. It includes Statistics & Probability, Linear Algebra and Calculus.Linear Algebra for Data ScienceStatistics for Data ScienceProbability for Data ScienceCalculus for Data SciencePractice Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability and Calculus3. Exploratory Data AnalysisExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It involves understanding data, cleaning data, visualizing data and further analysis.Exploratory Data Analysis or EDAEDA with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn4. Data AnalysisData Analysis is the technique of collecting, transforming and organizing data to make future predictions and informed data-driven decisions. It also helps to find possible solutions for a business problem.There are six steps for Data Analysis which are: Ask or Specify Data Requirements, Prepare or Collect Data, Clean and Process, Analyze, Share, Act or Report.Data AnalysisData Analytics ProjectsData Analysis QuizData Analytics Interview Questions5. Data VisualizationData visualization is the process of turning data into visual representations like charts, graphs and maps. It helps us understand trends, patterns and outliers.Data Visualization TutorialData Visualization ProjectsData Visualization QuizData Visualization Interview Questions6. Machine LearningMachine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. It can be categorized into three types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning.Machine Learning TutorialMachine Learning ProjectsMachine Learning QuizMachine Learning Interview Questions7. Data Science with PythonData science enables organizations to make informed decisions, solve problems and understand human behavior. As the volume of data grows, so does the demand for skilled data scientists. The most common languages used for data science are Python and R, with Python being particularly popular.Data Science TutorialData Science ProjectsData Science QuizData Science Interview Questions8. Deep LearningDeep Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables machines to learn from large amounts of data. It uses neural networks with many layers to automatically find patterns and make predictions. Deep Learning TutorialDeep Learning ProjectsDeep Learning QuizDeep Learning Interview Questions9. Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans.AI TutorialAI Interview QuestionsAI Projects10. Generative AI & LLM Generative AI (Gen AI) is a branch of artificial intelligence that can create new content instead of just analyzing data. It uses machine learning models (like large language models, GANs, and diffusion models) to generate text, images, audio, code, or even video. LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human-like language.Generative AI TutorialGenerative AI RoadmapLLM TutorialAI-ML-DS Interview QuestionsThe AI-ML-DS Interview Series is an essential resource designed for individuals aspiring to start or switch careers in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS).AI-ML-DS Interview Series
