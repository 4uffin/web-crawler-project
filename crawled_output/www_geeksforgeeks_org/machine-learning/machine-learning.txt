Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.Try our ongoing free course Data Science Skillup with weekly topic coverage, notes, daily quizzes and coding problems.Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.Additional Types:Self-Supervised Learning: Self-supervised learning is often considered as a
subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. Semi-Supervised Learning: This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.Module 1: Machine Learning PipelineThis section covers preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and model evaluation to prepare data, uncover insights and build reliable models.1.

Supervised Learning There are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are:1. Linear RegressionThis is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It helps find the relationship between input and output.Introduction to Linear RegressionGradient Descent in Linear RegressionMultiple Linear Regression2. Logistic RegressionUsed when the output is a "yes or no" type answer. It helps in predicting categories like pass/fail or spam/not spam.Understanding Logistic RegressionCost function in Logistic Regression3. Decision TreesA model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions, like a flowchart. Easy to understand and use.Decision Tree in Machine LearningTypes of Decision tree algorithmsDecision Tree - Regression (Implementation)Decision tree - Classification (Implementation)4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)A bit more advanced—it tries to draw the best line (or boundary) to separate different categories of data.Understanding SVMsSVM Hyperparameter Tuning - GridSearchCVNon-Linear SVM5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)This model looks at the closest data points (neighbors) to make predictions. Super simple and based on similarity.Introduction to KNNDecision Boundaries in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)6. Naïve BayesA quick and smart way to classify things based on probability. It works well for text and spam detection.Introduction to Naive BayesGaussian Naive BayesMultinomial Naive BayesBernoulli Naive BayesComplement Naive Bayes7. Random Forest (Bagging Algorithm)A powerful model that builds lots of decision trees and combines them for better accuracy and stability.Introduction to Random forestRandom Forest ClassifierRandom Forest RegressionHyperparameter Tuning in Random ForestIntroduction to Ensemble LearningEnsemble learning combines multiple simple models to create a stronger, smarter model. There are mainly two types of ensemble learning:Bagging that combines multiple models trained independently.Boosting that builds models sequentially each correcting the errors of the previous one.Module 3: Unsupervised learningUnsupervised learning are again divided into three main categories based on their purpose: Clustering Association Rule MiningDimensionality Reduction. Unsupervised learning1. ClusteringClustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarities or differences. Types of clustering algorithms are:Centroid-based Methods:K-Means clusteringElbow Method for optimal value of k in KMeansK-Means++ clusteringK-Mode clusteringFuzzy C-Means (FCM) ClusteringDistribution-based Methods: Gaussian mixture modelsExpectation-Maximization AlgorithmDirichlet process mixture models (DPMMs)Connectivity based methods: Hierarchical clustering Agglomerative ClusteringDivisive clusteringAffinity propagationDensity Based methods: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)2. Dimensionality ReductionDimensionality reduction is used to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while retaining the most important information.Principal Component Analysis (PCA)t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)Independent Component Analysis (ICA)IsomapLocally Linear Embedding (LLE)3. Association Rule Find patterns between items in large datasets typically in market basket analysis.Apriori algorithmImplementing apriori algorithmFP-Growth (Frequent Pattern-Growth)ECLAT (Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal)Module 4: Reinforcement LearningReinforcement learning interacts with environment and learn from them based on rewards.Reinforcement Learning1. Model-Based MethodsThese methods use a model of the environment to predict outcomes and help the agent plan actions by simulating potential results.Markov decision processes (MDPs)Bellman equationValue iteration algorithmMonte Carlo Tree Search2. Model-Free MethodsThe agent learns directly from experience by interacting with the environment and adjusting its actions based on feedback.Q-LearningSARSAMonte Carlo MethodsReinforce AlgorithmActor-Critic AlgorithmAsynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)Module 5: Semi Supervised LearningIt uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data making it helpful when labeling data is costly or it is very limited.Semi Supervised LearningSemi Supervised ClassificationSelf-Training in Semi-Supervised LearningFew-shot learning in Machine LearningModule 6: Forecasting ModelsForecasting models analyze past data to predict future trends, commonly used for time series problems like sales, demand or stock prices.ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)Module 7: Deployment of ML ModelsThe trained ML model must be integrated into an application or service to make its predictions accessible.
