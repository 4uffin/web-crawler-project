Many of the actors who star in the HBO Max series “The Pitt” have arrived on the Emmys red carpet.
The medical drama follows the emergency department staff at Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center as they navigate the challenges of a single 15-hour hospital shift.
The show premiered earlier this year and is nominated in four categories including outstanding drama series, outstanding lead actor in a drama series, outstanding supporting actress in drama series, and outstanding guest actor in a drama series.
HBO Max and CNN are both owned by parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.

From CNN staff
Let’s turn back to tonight’s host, Nate Bargatze, as we gear up for showtime.
Here’s a little more from his recent interview with CNN, where he shared which fellow comedians have lent him hosting counsel:

Spotted on the red carpet: Tim Cook and Ben Stiller
From CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister
The buzz is growing here on the red carpet along with the arrivals of more industry big wigs and show creators.
We just saw Apple CEO Tim Cook hanging out with comedy icon Ben Stiller, who directs and executive produces “Severance” for Cook’s Apple TV+.
“Severance” is the most nominated series of the night, with 27 nods. Created by Dan Erickson, the dystopian workplace series centers on employees who sign away all rights to their 9-to-5 brains.

“The White Lotus” star Walton Goggins will be celebrating no matter who takes home the award for best supporting actor in a drama series, he told CNN on the red carpet.
“We’ll definitely be drinking margaritas tomorrow regardless of who wins,” he said.
The category tonight features Goggins and his “White Lotus” co-stars Jason Isaacs and Sam Rockwell, along with a trio of “Severance” actors and James Marsden from “Paradise.”
Goggins — who, fashion icon that he is, arrived on the carpet in a silk blouse with more than a few buttons unfastened — called it “friendly competition.”
May the best man win.
“The White Lotus” streams on HBO Max, which like CNN is owned by the parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.

CNN is on the red carpet as the stars start to trickle in
From CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister
We’re here on the red carpet at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles, an hour or two before many A-listers typically arrive.
Walton Goggins, whose role on “The White Lotus” helped make him an internet favorite, was among the very first to arrive and is joking around with reporters, saying the only reason they want to chat with him is because there aren’t other stars here yet.
We all know that’s not true, Walton. CNN got a chance to catch up with him — we’ll have a little more on that conversation soon.
“The White Lotus” streams on HBO Max, which like CNN is owned by parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.

Nate Bargatze has an inspired plan to keep acceptance speeches short
From CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister
Comedian Nate Bargatze, who is a first-time host of the Emmys this year, tells CNN he has an inspired plan to keep the show — and acceptance speeches — running on time tonight.
He plans to donate $100,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of America at the top of the show, but there’s a catch: For every second that a speech exceeds the allotted 45 seconds, he’ll reduce the donation by $1,000.
“For every second they go over, the kids will get $1,000 less. And the kids will be there. And see it. And feel it. So is thanking your second manager worth taking food from a child?” Bargatze quipped. “I don’t think so, but we’ll see what Hollywood thinks.”
It does go both ways, though, since winners who end their thank-you’s under the allotted time will cause money to be added back to the pot.
“It is very serious. The amount of money I give to the Boys and Girls Club is totally up to all of Hollywood,” he said of the ultimate total the charity will receive.

Some key categories are packed with actors from the same show

One of the night’s most interesting subplots is the friendly — but fierce — competition we’ll see between co-stars, as some powerhouse ensembles are dominating key categories.
Supporting actor in drama has three nominees from “Severance” — Trammell Tillman, Zach Cherry and John Turturro — competing against three from “The White Lotus,” namely Sam Rockwell, Walton Goggins and Jason Isaacs.
The odd man out is James Marsden, who is nominated for “Paradise.”
The best supporting actress in drama category includes four nominees from “Lotus” — Carrie Coon, Parker Posey, Aimee Lou Wood and Natasha Rothwell.
Rothwell told CNN last month that the competition “couldn’t be more friendly.”
“I mean, I’m rooting for them always, even before I knew them through the show,” she said of her co-stars in contention. “I am just a fan of their work. And so it’s just a joy to be able to go to ‘Hollywood prom’ with them and celebrate!”
“The White Lotus” streams on HBO Max, which like CNN is owned by the parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.

There’s a lot of TV to watch these days — you’re not alone if you haven’t caught up on all the top shows nominated at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards.
Here’s a quick breakdown of some shows to highlight in particular:
• “Severance” has 27 nominations. Adam Scott stars in this science fiction psychological thriller with some things to say about modern corporate culture.
• “The Penguin” has 24 nominations. Reprising and expanding upon his role from 2022’s “The Batman,” Collin Farrell stars as the titular mobster in a hard-boiled look at the criminal underbelly of Gotham City.
• “The Studio” has 23 nominations. Comic actor and film and TV creator Seth Rogen stars in this irreverent look at how the Hollywood sausage gets made, with each episode welcoming industry heavyweights to play themselves.
• “White Lotus” also has 23 nominations. This was the third season of Mike White’s anthology series, which is set in ritzy resorts and examines social power dynamics — with a particular flair for skewering the ultra-wealthy.
Ready for a deeper dive? Here’s our full breakdown of top nominees.

Meet tonight's host: Nate Bargatze, the "nicest man in stand-up"

Every comedian brings a different flavor to hosting an award show: Jimmy Kimmel put politics front and center at the Oscars, while Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser wasn’t afraid to get a little raunchy. Both handed out barbs to famous attendees.
But Nate Bargatze, who will host the Emmys for the first time tonight, is known for keeping things clean — he’s even been dubbed the “nicest man in stand-up.”
“We will make jokes, so I’m going to fit along with what award shows do and make fun of the situation, but I’ll make fun of myself as well. We can do it in a good, fun way,” Bargatze told CNN in a recent interview. “I want the night to just be fun and silly and keep it moving.”
Bargatze’s nice-guy persona and family-friendly material catapulted him to becoming last year’s top-selling standup comedian in the US.
He gained popularity with comedy specials like “The Tennessee Kid” and “Nate Bargatze: Hello World” and has been performing sold-out shows this year on the Big Dumb Eyes World Tour.
His drawling, deadpan delivery could make for a fun contrast onstage tonight amid the glitz of the Primetime Emmy Awards.
