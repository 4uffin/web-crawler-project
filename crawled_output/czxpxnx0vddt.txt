Scotland are edging towards England's tryline through good carries. What a great start. They come back for a penalty that is kickable.

Helena Rowland would have wanted more distance with that clearance kick. Good chance for Scotland now.

No surprise that there was plenty of emotion in that rendition of 'Flower of Scotland'. It could be the last time Jade Konkel will sing it as a Scotland player. It could be the last time Bryan Easson will sing it as head coach.I dare say a few others might follow suit at the end of this World Cup cycle, whenever that may be.

Helena Rowland is one of the most understated world-class players at this tournament. The biggest compliment I can give her is she makes everyone look so much better. Everyone functions so much better around her.She's so easy to work with and being so dominant at 15, it takes pressure off her wingers.

"Thunderstruck" now rings out around the ground. Hopefully the DJ isn't foreshadowing anything.Although, Scotland might want the rain to keep lashing down and the wind to keep on blowing.Anything that levels the playing field will be welcomed by self-confessed "weather geek" Bryan Easson.

In England's final World Cup warm-up against France, the Red Roses silenced a buoyant crowd in Mont-de-Marsan, crossing four times through their maul.It delivered the first and final tries in their tournament opener against the United States, with Sadia Kabeya and Lark Atkin-Davies crossing.Samoa and Australia also succumbed to the steamroller.As England enter the knockout stages with Sunday's quarter-final against Scotland, and matches get tighter, it is a weapon they may reach for even more regularly.In top-tier matches since the last Women's Rugby World Cup, England have scored an average of 1.04 tries a game via their driven maul, well clear of the rest of the world.They cross the line once in every five mauls, an efficiency unmatched by anyone else.

I was at the captain's run yesterday at a sunny Clifton College. It was basked in sunshine, believe it or not!The tunes were just as loud as they are here at Ashton Gate, but one song stood out from the rest."All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us."Evie Gallagher and Emma Wassell were belting it out, among others. Was that a not-so coded message? Perhaps. Either way, they were hyped up.

To the world outside their bubble, it's not just mission improbable, it's mission impossible.The Scots have not beaten the English, overwhelming favourites to lift the trophy, since 1999 and the average score in their last 10 meetings shows a near 50-point gap."There is zero expectation on us," former Scotland captain Lisa Martin says on this week's Scotland Rugby Podcast. "We're the underdogs. We're in the position that we thrive in. Just go and make it a spectacle."This is the best rugby I've seen Scotland play in the past decade. We're talking about these players as threats and you'd like to think that England are actually looking at individuals now rather than just dismissing Scotland and being like, 'Ah, well, it's a given'."History, obviously, isn't in our favour, but just try to spoil the party."Image source, Getty Images
