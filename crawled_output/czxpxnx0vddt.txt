Emma Orr needed a little pep talk from Fran McGhie there. The relentless nature of this game is starting to tell on the Scots' mentality.15 minutes left to try and make sure the damage doesn't get any worse but there is a feeling this could be anything England want it to be.

Two balls ended up in the middle of that line-out. A clever play by the ball girl, who accidently chucked the ball on, to force a scrum?

Loads of changes. The big one is Abbie Ward coming on for England captain Zoe Aldcroft, who has come through an hour of the game well after not playing the last two pool matches because of a knee injury.

The Mexican waves have started, which tells you this one truly is over as a contest.Despite that, Scotland are still putting in a power of work. The exhaustion, emotional and physical, will be obvious come the end of this.
