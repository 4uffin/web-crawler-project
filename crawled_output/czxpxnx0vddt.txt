Whenever the hosts get down in Scotland's 22m, a drummer below us starts a slow beat, ratcheting it up with every phase of play, until England penetrate and cross the line.It doesn't half build the pressure.

It is about the variation in Holly Aitchison's game. It is a really polished performance.

Tatyana Heard tries to pull the ball back and it ends up in a mess. Scrum to Scotland. Weird play in the rain. Keep it tight surely?

It does not matter as England win a scrum penalty. Take two as they go into the corner.

Abby Dow has just nailed a wonderful 50:22, but England can't convert after a rare dart by Amy Cokayne goes miles wide of the target.

That was a great break from Zoe Aldcroft and a great pass by Holly Aitchison.If England's skills are done well, they are dangerous.

Another Scotland line-out is disrupted by England. No line-out and you simple can't compete in a World Cup quarter-final.

The worst-case scenario for Scotland was getting heavily beaten, and not putting on a performance to be proud of.They held their own for the first 10 minutes, but the following 20 has been one-way traffic and they've not helped themselves with constant set-piece mistakes.

I have been really impressed watching England's set piece, especially their scrum. It is all about England putting on the pressure.

A penalty for a high shot by Scotland. Nothing is now going right after a great start.

Holly Aitchison sends another clever kick behind Scotland. She has been excellent and is ready to again battle Zoe Harrison for that starting fly-half shirt.Scotland do well to clear their lines.

The call is obstruction. No try. England will be annoyed as that was all their own fault for taking out Scotland players at the line-out.
