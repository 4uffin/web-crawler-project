Reminds me of the purported Ralph Waldo Emerson quote which rings true for myself as well: “I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.”replychaps 10 minutes ago

This is nice and I have a similar philosophy towards writing, where I write in ephemeral mediums like a dry erase board or a chalk board. That way I know while I'm writing it that the words will eventually be gone. It really changes the way you interact with writing. It turns the goal into honing your intuition. That way, the next time you pursue that line of thinking, you have an intuition framework that your mental framework can be built upon.replySirensOfTitan 31 minutes ago

I do this but annotate books heavily by writing in the margins (digitally through my remarkable) and only very rarely ever revisit them.Writing while reading is a way of focusing on what either resonates with me or confounds me.replyadmiralrohan 2 hours ago

I found it more useful to read more books than read one book again and again. This helps me to reinforce the same concept from different angles. Our brain is a pattern matching machine, and it automatically picks up related concepts.replym-hodges 1 hour ago

It’s a fine perspective, but:> We can only read a text onceIs clearly false. OP is expressing a choice, not a truth.replyturtletontine 8 minutes ago

I think their point is clear if you read the rest of the sentence: “… given the number of compelling works and the limited time available to us”.Yes, it’s the OP’s choice, it’s their information diet. You COULD read the good stuff over and over, but you risk falling behind the flood. This is their approach to keeping up. It makes me a little sad, sure, but as a practical solution I get it.I certainly don’t use this approach to literature. I’ve reread my favorite books a few times over the years (Cat’s Cradle, White Noise), but I’m sure that’s not the kind of thing OP is talking about.replychaps 16 minutes ago

I recoiled at that a bit too, but I think what they mean is similar to how some games can "only be played once". Best example of that is Outer Wilds, where attaining information is the goal of each gameplay loop. Once you've acquired that knowledge already, the fun of acquiring it can no longer be experienced since you already know what the "next step" is.replym-hodges 12 minutes ago

Quite often, the meaning of a text relies on the contexts you bring to it. I’ve had many experiences where I’ve returned to a text after reading others, and gleaned entirely new or different insights from it. I disagree with the idea that first exposure exhausts the knowledge (or in OP’s perspective, “Bayesian system”) that can be acquired.replychaps 5 minutes ago

I didn't say it exhausts the knowledge.. what I'm saying is very much the opposite of that -- knowledge is front and center. I'm more referring to the experience and new lenses on past similar experiences, which I think we're in agreement on.Go play Outer Wilds if you want to experience what I mean. It's the only game I've played that's affected me so strongly in this way."No man ever steps in the same river twice"replyJSR_FDED 55 minutes ago

Great article, I can’t remember anything from it.replywpollock 1 hour ago

If you read many sources without taking notes, it becomes difficult to later cite your sources.Your attitude makes sense when reading for pleasure, such as HN posts unrelated to your work.replytreetalker 2 hours ago

The corollary is to write to forget (or at least to get thoughts off your mind).replyqwertytyyuu 1 hour ago
