Since news of Charlie Kirk's death was announced, members of the Trump family - including the president and his sons Don Jr and Eric - have spoken fondly about the close personal ties they had with him.Matt Dallek, a professor at George Washington University, tells the BBC that the relationship between Kirk and the Trump family was âreally importantâ to his broader influence in both terms.âTrump prizes loyalty above maybe anything else,â he says. âAnd if Don Jr is saying he was like a brother to him, that suggests just how great a supporter Kirk was.âAccording to Dallek, Kirk remained loyal even during the fallout of the 6 January 2021 riots at the US Capitol, when some other conservative figures turned critical of Trump.âAt Trumpâs lowest point, Kirk was there backing him,â says Dallek. âThey had a maximalist bond.âImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Charlie Kirk spoke at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in 2022
