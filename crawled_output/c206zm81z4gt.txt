As we've reported, Tyler Robinson was arrested after confessing to his father - his father then reached out to a family friend, a clergy member, who told authorities.We earlier spoke to Chris Piehota, a retired FBI executive assistant director. He says it's a "common occurrence" for people close to a suspect to convince them to turn themselves in.Piehota says it's common because of the "potential consequences of being hunted down and cornered by law enforcement" which could "result in injury or death for certain people". "The family members can persuade the person to turn themselves in based upon... an attack of conscience or self-preservation to protect themselves from being taken from their loved ones in a violent manner."

Tyler Robinson's name was circulating online before today's announcement was made - and the team at BBC Verify were searching for social media accounts which could be linked to him.We found a Facebook profile for someone we thought was his mother - they share the same surname, live in the same area, and had posted a lot of pictures of someone who looks very much like Tyler Robinson.We subsequently found that some of the images gave a 99.5% or more match when put through facial recognition software, alongside the mugshot of Tyler Robinson released by officials.One of the photos on the Facebook account shows him holding up a certificate from Pine View Middle School in the city of St George in southern Utah. Another was taken at Utah State University in Logan in northern Utah. Officials later confirmed he studied at both.Image source, FacebookThe photo at the university shows Tyler Robinson holding up a document in front of a sign outside one the engineering buildings there from 2021 - suggesting he may have studied in that department.Image source, FacebookIn another video posted on the Facebook profile, he is seen reading from a letter, saying: "Congratulations you have been selected to receive the resident presidential scholarship from Utah State University. The value of this scholarship is approximately $32,000. This scholarship is available for four years or eight semesters."The university has confirmed that he went there for one semester in 2021, but wouldn't confirm what he studied or why he left early when asked by BBC Verify.

We have more details about how Robinson was turned in to law enforcement. Two law enforcement sources tell CBS News, the BBC's US partner, Tyler Robinson's father relayed his son's confession to a clergy member - the family friend we heard about earlier.That clergy member took the tip to the US Marshals Service, and then Robinson was detained.Earlier in the morning, President Trump told Fox News that a "minister" was involved in helping authorities detain Robinson. It is unclear what religion or denomination the clergy person is affiliated with.

Image caption, Utah Valley University students held signs praising Kirk near campusStudents here at Utah Valley University are feeling a sense of relief after officials announced the suspect they believe killed Kirk has been arrested. The campus has been in a standstill since Wednesday afternoon - with yellow police tape and police vehicles blocking much of the school. Classes were cancelled and many students have been telling me that theyâve been trying to stay close to home due to the manhunt. For McKinley Shinkle, the news - while helping him and other students move forward - also made his stomach drop. "He was apprehended in Washington County, which is where Iâm from," the freshman tells me. "I just feel deeply ashamed." Many students had been theorising that perhaps the suspect wasnât from here - as both this area and the state as a whole is a conservative stronghold. "Iâm definitely relieved," McKinley's cousin Anthony told me. "Iâm just anxious now to hear his motives and why this happened." The pair made signs that they waved at passing cars near the entrance of campus, calling Kirk a hero and saying they arenât afraid. They said the messages are directed at the killer and anyone else who has celebrated Kirkâs killing. "I don't know if I could describe Charlie Kirk as a martyr, but I know for me, personally, he was a martyr," Anthony told me, adding this was the first political effort he or his cousin had ever been involved in - but it certainly wonât be the last.

"Everybody loved Charlie!", Trump writes alongside a picture of the pair embracing, with US and Israeli flags behind them. The picture contains the words: 'Great Charlie Kirk. R.I.P Shlomo perl."Vice President JD Vance has also shared a post on social media thanking authorities for finding the suspect."In some ways, the investigation is still in the early days. But I do believe we have the shooter in custody," he says. "We took a big step this morning in getting justice for Charlie, and for his family. Thanks be to God for that," he writes.
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBullet casing inscriptions give possible clue to motivepublished at 16:02 BST16:02 BSTMike WendlingBBC News
The markings on the bullets described by authorities
indicate that the suspect, Tyler Robinson, was steeped in online culture and
included references to the Antifa, or the anti-fascist, movement. A fired shell casing was inscribed with ânotices bulges OwO
whatâs this?â - a reference to a âcopypastaâ - a piece of text that is repeated
over and over again, often to troll people online.Authorities say one unfired casing had the words âHey fascist! Catch!â and an up, right and three down arrows. The three down arrows alone could be a common symbol used to represent the anti-fascist movement. As a whole, the sequence of arrows could reference a gaming cheat code - although this remains unclear, and authorities have not yet released images of the casings.A second casing had the lyrics to a song âBella Ciaoâ
inscribed on it. The song honours WWII-era partisans of the Italian resistance
who fought Nazi Germany.The third unfired casing was inscribed with the words âIf
you read this, you are gay lmaoâ - again an apparent
reference to online trolling humour. Antifa is a loose collection of far-left activists who have been active in the US over the last decade, at street protests and other events. They often oppose Trump's policies and far-right groups.

"It is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the American experiment, it is an attack on our ideals," he says, adding it "cuts to the very foundation of who we are".Cox says Kirk being killed while championing freedom of expression makes it "more difficult for people to feel like they can share their ideas" and speak freely. "We will never be able to solve all the other problems - including the violence problems that people are worried about -
if we can't have a clash of ideas safely and securely. Even - especially, especially, those ideas with which you disagree," he adds.
