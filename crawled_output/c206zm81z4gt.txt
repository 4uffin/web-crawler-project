Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kirk (third from the right), enjoyed a very close relationship with the Trump family, in particular Donald Trump Jr (third from the left)For people outside the US, Kirk's significance to the Trump movement may be hard to grasp, as many countries - the UK included - don't have a comparable figure."Other than my father, [Kirk] was the single-handed most important player of the last election," the president's son Donald Trump Jr told the Megyn Kelly Show last night.Despite not holding elected office, Kirk became a big part of the Trump machine through being able to reach young people on social media.Trump Jr says Kirk, who died aged 31, "moved the youth vote... especially the male vote"."When you're that age, it's a little more effective that sending an 85-year-old establishment politician... who doesn't understand social media... doesn't feel the vibe of what's going on. Charlie did those things."Analysis by Navigator Research conducted around the time of the election suggested 52% of Trump supporters got their news from social media.Trump made a string of appearances on podcasts hosted by influencers like Logan Paul, Adina Ross and Joe Rogan, and turned to social media activists to reach voters they might otherwise struggled to make an impression with.In the end, Trump increased his shared of the youth vote from 36% in 2020 to 46% in 2024, according to Circle, a centre that researches youth civic engagement.That helped Trump to a decisive win - and, as the president's son makes clear, his camp viewed Kirk as a major factor in that.

The manhunt for the gunman who killed Charlie Kirk continues. This is what we know.
The suspect arrived on campus at 11:52 local time on Wednesday
He reached his position by climbing the stairwells to the roof, before opening fire at around 12:20
CCTV footage shows a figure dressed in black running across a roof before dropping down to the ground and fleeing
The FBI recovered a weapon - an imported Mauser .30-06 bolt action rifle - in a wooded area near the scene wrapped in a towel
They are also analysis a palm print and a "footwear impression"
But there is still a great deal we don't know, including:
Where the search is being carried out - Utah law enforcement agency has "no idea" if suspect still in state
The name of the suspected gunman or any other identifying details
Whether police know some of that information and have chosen not to make it public at this stage

US military leaders have warned troops and staff over posts mocking the shooting of Charlie Kirk. Writing on X, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says it is "unacceptable for military personnel and Department of War civilians to celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American. The Department of War has zero tolerance for it."Responding, Hegseth says: "We are tracking all these very closely â and will address, immediately. Completely unacceptable."It is unclear which posts Parnell and Hegseth are referring to.As a reminder, Donald Trump recently ordered the Department of Defense be rebranded as the Department of War.

Image source, FBIInvestigators are describing the person pictured in the CCTV stills above as a "person of interest" while they try to gather more information which could lead to the individual being labelled a suspect, a former FBI special agent has told the BBC News Channel.Kenneth Gray says law enforcement will be doing a "deep dive" into the leads that could identify the person pictured in photos the FBI released, in what Gray described as a "rapidly evolving investigation".But the description "suspect" has been used by Utah officials when describing the video of a person seen jumping down from a roof at Utah Valley University.Gray says having an identification "is only half of the equation, the other half is locating that person".
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingKirk's death has shaken me to the core, US conservative pundit sayspublished at 10:02 BST10:02 BST
"People are hurting, they're in shock," US conservative political commentator and radio host Scott Jennings tells the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
"Charlie
Kirk went to college campuses, which are not hotbeds of conservative activity,
and he wanted to engage in civil discourse with people that disagreed with him," Jennings says. "That's kind of how we're supposed to do it," he continues. "Using speech is the opposite of using violence to solve our
problems in the political system."When asked how this has affected him professionally, Jennings responds saying "tremendously." "I respected what Charlie did and I respect people that
engage in debate. I believe itâs the bedrock, of our political system
and to think Charlie was gunned down in the middle of one of these debates, itâs
really shaken me to the core," he answers. Jennings says that the White House Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles, had told him that before Kirk was killed that they were planning further action on how to handle violent crime in the US.
"This adds a heightened sense of urgency to that," he says.

Image source, EPAThe sudden and violent death of Charlie Kirk, who rallied a youth movement and held celebrity status among his fans, has sparked fierce debate over his political legacy.The 31-year-old's young supporters appreciated his conservative Christian values and frank opinions. Speaking to the BBC, many were in tears as they remembered a man who listened to them and understood their concerns.His views were polarising on the college campuses where he held large events, and his provocative speeches would draw crowds of vocal opponents as well as fans.Now, both supporters and opponents have been left shaken after he was killed by a single shot on stage while debating at a university in Utah."I am sad, distraught," said the left-wing influencer Dean Withers, 21, who is known for posting about political issues and debating conservatives, including Kirk.Julia Pierce, who has been a member of Kirk's organisation, Turning Point USA, for more than 10 years, said he would be remembered for giving young conservatives in America the confidence to be themselves."It used to be that for young people it was cool to be a Democrat. But he made it cool to be a Trump supporter and to wear the Maga hat and live your life with traditional family values," she told the BBC.Read more on how young fans and critics have been reacting to Kirk's death here.

I spoke to a student earlier who broke down in tears when detailing what the last day has been like. Scott Sperry, a 22-year-old sophomore here at Utah Valley
University, attended Kirkâs event on Wednesday. He told me how excited he was.
Heâd watched Kirkâs videos online for years and was able to snag some space at the very front of the audience to watch him
debate students. Then a bang rang out. At first everyone was confused. Maybe
it was a firecracker, he thought initially. Then he watched in
horror as someone he considers a âconservative idolâ fell limp with blood
gushing from his neck. âI am trying to deal with it,â he says, choking up as he
recites what he witnessed. âTrying to get my mind off things.â He says heâs been leaning on friends but plans to utilise
campus resources to deal with the trauma. âI keep seeing it every
time I close my eyes,â he says. âItâs everywhere, no matter where
I go. Iâm just reliving the moment over and over again.â

Image source, BBC NewsEarlier today, BBC chief presenter Caitriona Perry spoke to David Engelhardt, Charlie Kirk's pastor and a board member of Kirk's organisation, Turning Point USA.He says that Kirk was a great friend and courageous person who "stood against the orthodoxy of our time" and encouraged an open dialogue on campuses."His premise was to begin conversations with people. And the reality is conversations are challenging and polarising," Engelhardt says.Perry notes in the interview that some of Kirk's views were controversial and offensive, but that he always wanted to have that debate to justify his viewpoints and hear what others had to say. Engelhardt agrees."Finding a balance in a politically divided time where entertainment media feeds on controversy - and controversy is not a bad thing necessarily - but when it's inflamed to the point of violence, we have real problems," he says.Engelhardt adds that it seems "imperative that political conversations continue", but also "that the love and the decision to respect the dignity of the human being remains essential in the conversation".

Former FBI agent Dennis Franks spoke to the BBC News Channel earlier, and said that he believed the shooter was likely a hunter. âIt required a lot of confidence to be able to take the shot, to execute and hit where it did,â he told the BBC, explaining that the distance of the shooting would not be challenging for an experienced shooter.While "anyone could go down to a rifle range and train with a scope", the former FBI agent said it was a combination of the area and the "confidence" of the gunman that suggested to him that the person who shot Charlie Kirk could be a hunter. âI tend to think from a behavioural standpoint that he acted alone,â he said. He urged people to be patient, and reiterated that he was confident that the shooter would be identified, after which it would "be a matter of finding him".
