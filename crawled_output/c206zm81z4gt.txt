Image source, BBC NewsEarlier today, BBC chief presenter Caitriona Perry spoke to David Engelhardt, Charlie Kirk's pastor and a board member of Kirk's organisation, Turning Point USA.He says that Kirk was a great friend and courageous person who "stood against the orthodoxy of our time", stood "specifically against nonviolence" and encouraged an open dialogue on campuses."His premise was to begin conversations with people. And the reality is conversations are challenging and polarising," Engelhardt says.Perry notes in the interview that some of Kirk's views were controversial and offensive, but that he always wanted to have that debate to justify his viewpoints and hear what others had to say. Engelhardt agrees."Finding a balance in a politically divided time where entertainment media feeds on controversy - and controversy is not a bad thing necessarily - but when it's inflamed to the point of violence, we have real problems," he says.Engelhardt adds that it seems "imperative that political conversations continue", but also "that the love and the decision to respect the dignity of the human being remains essential in the conversation".

The governor added that authorities were gathering the evidence needed to "pursue the death penalty"

Former FBI agent Dennis Franks spoke to the BBC News Channel earlier, and said that he believed the shooter was likely a hunter. âIt required a lot of confidence to be able to take the shot, to execute and hit where it did,â he told the BBC, explaining that the distance of the shooting would not be challenging for an experienced shooter.While "anyone could go down to a rifle range and train with a scope", the former FBI agent said it was a combination of the area and the "confidence" of the gunman that suggested to him that the person who shot Charlie Kirk could be a hunter. âI tend to think from a behavioural standpoint that he acted alone,â he said. He urged people to be patient, and reiterated that he was confident that the shooter would be identified, after which it would "be a matter of finding him".

Chris Piehota, a retired FBI executive assistant director, was speaking to the BBC's Newsday programme a while ago.He said the FBI was likely still in the stage of gathering and analysing data from the shooting - including footage from personal devices, surveillance footage and audio clips.He said he's "confident" that they would catch the shooter."I am confident that the FBI is one of the best man-hunting organisations in existence," Piehota said, adding that the FBI has "massive resources" to "aggregate and analyse" information - and similar processes were used during the Las Vegas shooting in 2017.

Have we forgotten that?â Kozak says.âPeople have obviously pointed to the irony that the point I was trying to make is how peaceful the left was right before he got shot - and that only makes sense if we stayed peaceful."
