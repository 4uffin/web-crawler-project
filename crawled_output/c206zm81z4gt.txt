Since news of Charlie Kirk's death was announced, members of the Trump family - including the president and his sons Don Jr and Eric - have spoken fondly about the close personal ties they had with him.Matt Dallek, a professor at George Washington University, tells the BBC that the relationship between Kirk and the Trump family was âreally importantâ to his broader influence in both terms.âTrump prizes loyalty above maybe anything else,â he says. âAnd if Don Jr is saying he was like a brother to him, that suggests just how great a supporter Kirk was.âAccording to Dallek, Kirk remained loyal even during the fallout of the 6 January 2021 riots at the US Capitol, when some other conservative figures turned critical of Trump.âAt Trumpâs lowest point, Kirk was there backing him,â says Dallek. âThey had a maximalist bond.âImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Charlie Kirk spoke at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in 2022

At times, Trump's tone seemed to harden even more and he paced back and forth along the lengthy stream of reporters gathered on the lawn. At one point, he suddenly came so close to me that I was momentarily terrified that I was going to accidentally strike him with the radio microphone pole I was holding just inches from his sternum. When asked about the investigation and any potential leads, the president gave few details away. "I have an indication," he said, his eyes narrowing. "But we'll let you know about that later." He reserved his harshest words for the suspect that remains at large. "He's an animal. Total animal, and hopefully they'll have him," he told us. "What he did is disgraceful....what this man did, was disgraceful. Hopefully we'll have him and deal with him appropriately." At one point, Trump thanked us and walked away, only to abruptly reverse course when he saw a young reporter that works for Turning Point USA
- Charlie Kirk's organisation. "They're great friends of mine," he said of the organisation. After taking a few more questions on other matters, Trump walked away, quickly entering the helicopter before taking off. It's possible we may hear from him again tonight - particularly if there are developments in the case.

But now, he appeared to be his usual self - speaking with a louder, more forceful tone than before.At one point, he was asked about his own safety - but said he is "not really" concerned."I'm really concerned for our country. We have a great country, but a radical left group of lunatics out there," he said. "We're going to get that problem solved."
