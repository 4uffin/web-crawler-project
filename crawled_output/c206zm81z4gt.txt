Weâve been listening
back to Wednesday's episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, released just hours
before he was killed.The
31-year-old covered a range of
right-wing talking points that have been driving the week's political agenda,
including some which Trump and the White House have repeatedly drawn attention
to. They included ICE deportations in Chicago, the murder of a Ukrainian
refugee and what Kirk called the "ever-increasing amount of black
crime".During a discussion with
a Department of Homeland Security official early in the podcast, Kirk said city
mayors who do not co-operate with federal ICE raids should be "in
jail".On the show,
he also made the false claim that George Floyd, who was murdered by a white
police officer in 2020, had died of an "overdose".In one segment, Kirk
discussed the
murder of Iryna
Zarutska, and claimed "empirical" data showed
that "black people killing white people" was the "most common
race-based hate attack" in America."See the left, they
donât like it when I say things like this. But Iâm sorry," he said.According to the latest FBI crime data, external,
10,805 hate crimes were reported in the US in the past year, with 2,872 against
black people, while 847 were recorded as "anti-white".

Atrocities like the murder of Charlie Kirk often produce a moment of political consensus as people from opposing sides of the debate unite to condemn violence and call for calm.But across America, expressions of grief and shock are competing for attention with incendiary rhetoric from Kirkâs fans and foes.People who disagreed with him are openly celebrating his death online and suggesting he deserved to be killed.On the right, there are calls for vengeance and a harsh crackdown on left-wing activists.In an address from the Oval Office, President Trump blamed the news media and the "radical left" for "demonising those with whom you disagree".Governor Spencer Cox of Utah warned today that political violence "metastasizes" and the country needs to "find an off ramp or its going to get much much worse".Opinion polls suggest that America's appetite for political violence has grown in recent years, with increasing numbers of people saying it can be justified.After a spate of recent murders and violent political attacks â including two attempts on Donald Trumpâs life last year â there is widespread concern that this could be a dangerous moment in America.

Chairman of the Young Republican National Federation, Hayden Padgett, says he "couldn't believe more" in Utah Governor Spencer Cox's words.The governor took a moment to address young people during the news conference with the FBI earlier.
He said:"Your generation has an opportunity to build a culture that is very different than what we're suffering through right now. Not by pretending differences don't matter, but by embracing our differences and having those hard conversations."Padgett tells the BBC: "The only way we heal in this country and get better and make things move forward is if we are more like Charlie, and do more of what he was doing that very day."

"There's nothing more un-American than hating our fellow Americans."Those were the words of Utah's Republican Governor, Spencer Cox. Not today, but last week.I was on the dais at the National Press Club, watching him speak alongside Maryland's Democratic Governor, Wes Moore.The topic? Choosing dialogue over division. Itâs familiar ground for Spencer Cox - heâs been asking Americans to do that for years.Heâs run TV ads, made speeches, held conferences - all with the tagline, "Disagree Better", external.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Just last week, Utah Republican Governor Spencer Cox (R) was promoting reasoned debate with Maryland Democratic Governor Wes Moore (L)Politically, the conservative Cox and the liberal Moore are poles apart, but last Thursday they showed a friendship thatâs hard to fake.âWe're both dads, we're both husbands, we both love college footballâ¦ we have great hair,â joked the very bald Utahn, as the equally-bald Moore laughed along.They offered a vision of hope. âI really like this guy,â said Cox. âAnd I don't have to tear him down because we disagree on abortion orâ¦ on something else.â Less than a week later, the most high-profile political assassination in recent US history took place in Cox's own backyard - the latest evidence, it seems, of the toxicity and division he warned about.On Friday, under the glare of the national spotlight, Cox could only repeat his plea.âAt some point, we have to find an off-ramp... or itâs going to get much, much worse..."

Image source, Getty ImagesAs we reported earlier, law enforcement has found markings on ammunition inside the rifle recovered into this case, including an up, right, and three down arrows.It appears these arrows are linked to video gaming.The arrow symbols match the input needed to use a stratagem in the video game Helldivers 2.That stratagem, Eagle 500kg Bomb, external, is considered one of the most destructive special moves in the game.The game, which won two Bafta awards earlier this year, was a smash hit. Set in a satirical universe inspired by the 1990s sci-fi film Starship Troopers, players can team up with friends or strangers to kill big insects and robots.
Notably, the theme of the game includes some political references. On its Steam page, there is a description which says:"Freedom. Peace. Democracy."Your Super Earth-born rights."The key pillars of our civilisation."Of our very existence."But the war rages on. And everything is once again under threat."Join the greatest military force the galaxy has ever seen and make this a safe and free place to live."

As we've reported, Tyler Robinson was arrested after confessing to his father - his father then reached out to a family friend, a clergy member, who told authorities.We earlier spoke to Chris Piehota, a retired FBI executive assistant director. He says it's a "common occurrence" for people close to a suspect to convince them to turn themselves in.Piehota says it's common because of the "potential consequences of being hunted down and cornered by law enforcement" which could "result in injury or death for certain people". "The family members can persuade the person to turn themselves in based upon... an attack of conscience or self-preservation to protect themselves from being taken from their loved ones in a violent manner."
