The markings on the bullets described by authorities
indicate that the suspect, Tyler Robinson, was steeped in online culture and
included references to the Antifa , or the anti-fascist, movement. A fired shell casing was inscribed with ânotices bulges OwO
whatâs this?â - a reference to a âcopypastaâ - a piece of text that is repeated
over and over again, often to troll people online. Authorities say one unfired casing had the words âHey
fascist! Catch!â and three down arrows - a common symbol used to represent the
anti-fascist movement.A second casing had the lyrics to a song âBella Ciaoâ
inscribed on it. The song honours WWII-era partisans of the Italian resistance
who fought Nazi Germany.The third unfired casing was inscribed with the words âIf
you read this, you are gay lmaoâ - again an apparent
reference to online trolling humour. Antifa is a loose collection of far-left activists who have been active in the US over the last decade, at street protests and other events. They often oppose Trump's policies and far-right groups.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox is visibly emotional and says in the past 48 hours: "I have been as angry as I have ever been, as sad as I have ever been.""As anger pushed me to the brink, Charlie's words brought me back," he says.He quotes Kirk as saying "When people stop talking, that's when you get violence".He adds that young people "loved and hated Charlie" and he "went into those places anyway".He then addresses young people and says: "You are inheriting a country where politics feels like rage. It feels like rage is the only option."But, he adds: "Your generation has an opportunity to build a culture that is very different than what we're suffering through right now. Not by pretending differences don't matter, but by embracing our differences and having those hard conversations.""There is one person responsible for what happened here and that person is now in custody and will be charged soon and will be held accountable," he adds.

Image source, Getty ImagesUtah Governor Spencer Cox returns to the podium and says he wants to address "where we are and how we got here".He says violence is tragic everywhere and explains Kirk's killing is "much bigger than an attack on an individual". "It is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the American experiment, it is an attack on our ideals," he says, adding it "cuts to the very foundation of who we are".Cox says Kirk being killed while championing freedom of expression makes it "more difficult for people to feel like they can share their ideas" and speak freely. "We will never be able to solve all the other problems - including the violence problems that people are worried about -
if we can't have a clash of ideas safely and securely. Even - especially, especially, those ideas with which you disagree," he adds.

By Matt MurphyAt BBC Verify we've been digging into social media accounts
associated with Tyler Robinson, who has been named as the suspect in
the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. One Facebook profile that we believe belongs to his mother -
which she now appears to be clearing of images of Tyler - suggests the family
comes from Cedar City in Utah, around three hours drive from the Utah Valley
University where the shooting took place. Her account reveals numerous details about the family's life
and includes photos of trips they made - some of which appear to have included
visits to gun ranges. Other posts on her profile reveal that Tyler Robinson
attended Pineview Middle School. In 2022, he moved to the city of Logan to
attended Utah State University - about two hours drive from Utah Valley
University. We're still searching for any profiles that belong to Tyler
and will bring you more information as we get it.
