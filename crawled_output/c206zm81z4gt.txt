Image source, ReutersIt's just past 23:00 in Utah - if you're just joining us now, here are the latest developments.
The FBI held a short press conference a few hours ago, where they released a new video of the suspect fleeing the scene of the shooting
The suspect was wearing Converse shoes and a "distinctive" black t-shirt with an American flag and eagle, which the FBI highlighted as key details that could lead to identifying the suspect
Officials said they believe the suspect is of "college-age" and have recovered a high-powered bolt-action rifle - an imported Mauser. 30-06 bolt-action rifle - which they believed was used in the shooting
The governor added that authorities were gathering the evidence needed to "pursue the death penalty"
Charlie Kirk's casket was flown from Utah to Arizona on Air Force Two - the vice-president's aircraft - with the Vice-President JD Vance on board
The police department have said that multiple leads are being investigated but that no suspect has been caught yet
Vigils were held across the US on Thursday evening to commemorate Kirk, who was an influential conservative activist

Former FBI agent Dennis Franks spoke to the BBC News Channel earlier, and said that he believed the shooter was likely a hunter. âIt required a lot of confidence to be able to take the shot, to execute and hit where it did,â he told the BBC, explaining that the distance of the shooting would not be challenging for an experienced shooter.While "anyone could go down to a rifle range and train with a scope", the former FBI agent said it was a combination of the area and the "confidence" of the gunman that suggested to him that the person who shot Charlie Kirk could be a hunter. âI tend to think from a behavioural standpoint that he acted alone,â he said. He urged people to be patient, and reiterated that he was confident that the shooter would be identified, after which it would "be a matter of finding him".

Chris Piehota, a retired FBI executive assistant director, was speaking to the BBC's Newsday programme a while ago.He said the FBI was likely still in the stage of gathering and analysing data from the shooting - including footage from personal devices, surveillance footage and audio clips.He said he's "confident" that they would catch the shooter."I am confident that the FBI is one of the best man-hunting organisations in existence," Piehota said, adding that the FBI has "massive resources" to "aggregate and analyse" information - and similar processes were used during the Las Vegas shooting in 2017.

Shortly before FBI released a fresh video showing the escape of the suspected shooter, the last student who asked Charlie Kirk a question during the campus debate spoke out on social media.In a video on Instagram, Hunter Kozak, a current student of Utah Valley University, says: "You sick... psychos that think this is the answer - it's not."At the debate, Kozak was asking Kirk a question about gun violence moments before the gunshot rang out.âIâm on the record with how much I disagree with Charlie Kirk but like, man dude, he is still a human being. Have we forgotten that?â Kozak says.âPeople have obviously pointed to the irony that the point I was trying to make is how peaceful the left was right before he got shot - and that only makes sense if we stayed peaceful."
