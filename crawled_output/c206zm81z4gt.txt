By Matt MurphyAt BBC Verify we've been digging into social media accounts
associated with Tyler Robinson, who has been named as the suspect in
the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. One Facebook profile that we believe belongs to his mother -
which she now appears to be clearing of images of Tyler - suggests the family
comes from Cedar City in Utah, around three hours drive from the Utah Valley
University where the shooting took place. Her account reveals numerous details about the family's life
and includes photos of trips they made - some of which appear to have included
visits to gun ranges. Other posts on her profile reveal that Tyler Robinson
attended Pineview Middle School. In 2022, he moved to the city of Logan to
attended Utah State University - about two hours drive from Utah Valley
University. We're still searching for any profiles that belong to Tyler
and will bring you more information as we get it.
