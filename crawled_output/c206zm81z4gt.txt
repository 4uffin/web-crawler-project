Since news of Charlie Kirk's death was announced, members of the Trump family - including the president and his sons Don Jr and Eric - have spoken fondly about the close personal ties they had with him.Matt Dallek, a professor at George Washington University, tells the BBC that the relationship between Kirk and the Trump family was âreally importantâ to his broader influence in both terms.âTrump prizes loyalty above maybe anything else,â he says. âAnd if Don Jr is saying he was like a brother to him, that suggests just how great a supporter Kirk was.âAccording to Dallek, Kirk remained loyal even during the fallout of the 6 January 2021 riots at the US Capitol, when some other conservative figures turned critical of Trump.âAt Trumpâs lowest point, Kirk was there backing him,â says Dallek. âThey had a maximalist bond.âImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Charlie Kirk spoke at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in 2022

Here's more from that statement from Utah's Department of Public Safety. It says:
Multiple leads are being
investigated but no suspect is in custody
The photos released earlier are of the "potential shooter" and were taken from security footage on campus just before the shooting. Earlier, officials labelled the subject "person of interest"
The reward of up to $100,000 for information "speaks to the seriousness of the crime", the statement says
No further detail is given on the weapon. The statement mentions reports of potential inscriptions and symbols - but says "we are not able to provide further details on the content of those inscriptions" or confirm the authenticity of any photos
There have been more than 200 tips from the public - "and they keep coming in"

At times, Trump's tone seemed to harden even more and he paced back and forth along the lengthy stream of reporters gathered on the lawn. At one point, he suddenly came so close to me that I was momentarily terrified that I was going to accidentally strike him with the radio microphone pole I was holding just inches from his sternum. When asked about the investigation and any potential leads, the president gave few details away. "I have an indication," he said, his eyes narrowing. "But we'll let you know about that later." He reserved his harshest words for the suspect that remains at large. "He's an animal. Total animal, and hopefully they'll have him," he told us. "What he did is disgraceful....what this man did, was disgraceful. Hopefully we'll have him and deal with him appropriately." At one point, Trump thanked us and walked away, only to abruptly reverse course when he saw a young reporter that works for Turning Point USA
- Charlie Kirk's organisation. "They're great friends of mine," he said of the organisation. After taking a few more questions on other matters, Trump walked away, quickly entering the helicopter before taking off. It's possible we may hear from him again tonight - particularly if there are developments in the case.

Image source, ReutersDonald Trump took off from the South Lawn of the White House at exactly 16:47 EST (20:47 GMT) - but not before coming over to talk to reporters for an extended Q&A session, focused largely on the death of Charlie Kirk.At the start of the questions, Trump confirmed he had spoken to Charlie Kirk's wife and family."She's devastated, absolutely devastated," he said of Kirk's wife Erika.When I saw him earlier this morning, Trump seemed unusually subdued, speaking softly and slowly. But now, he appeared to be his usual self - speaking with a louder, more forceful tone than before.At one point, he was asked about his own safety - but said he is "not really" concerned."I'm really concerned for our country. We have a great country, but a radical left group of lunatics out there," he said. "We're going to get that problem solved."

I think itâs nice having people like that in the world to challenge your own ideas.âI enjoyed debating him because he said things that made me think. If nothing else, I got the impression that he was an incredible father and husband.â

Charlie Kirk's killing is both another episode of shocking gun violence in America â and the latest in an ever-lengthening line of recent political violence.Earlier this year, two Democratic state legislators in Minnesota were shot in their homes â with one dying from her wounds. Last year, Donald Trump was twice the target of assassination attempts.Two years before that, a hammer-wielding assailant broke in to the home of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a prominent Democrat. In 2017, a man opened fire on Republican congressmen practising on a baseball field.Many prominent Republicans and Democrats have lined up to condemn political violence and call for a cooling of rhetoric.Trump, in a video address from the Oval Office posted on his Truth Social website, called the killing a "dark moment for America".But he wasted little time in blaming the "radical left" for Kirk's murder. He ticked through some of the recent instances of political violence - those that targeted conservatives - and said his administration would find "each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence".Those comments are sure to be welcomed by those on the right who in the hours after the shooting called for a crackdown on left-wing groups."It is time, within the confines of the law, to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos," conservative activist Christopher Rufo wrote on X.Meanwhile, Utah Governor Spencer Cox â who has frequently spoken out against overheated political rhetoric and political divisiveness â on Wednesday night described a "broken" nation."Is this it?" he asked. "Is this what 250 years has wrought upon us?""I pray that is not the case".Read more: Killing of Trump ally lays bare America's bloody and broken politics
