US representative Nancy Mace says she will introduce a resolution to Congress to authorise Charlie Kirk to "lie in honour" in the Capitol Rotunda - a grand circular room in the US Capitol."He inspired millions, led countless souls to Christ, and never wavered in defense of the First Amendment. Such a legacy makes him uniquely worthy of this distinction," the lawmaker writes on X.To lie in state in the Rotunda means people will be able to visit Kirk's casket to pay their respects, for a period of time determined by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the president.
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWhy Donald Trump Jr viewed Kirk as essential to campaign's successpublished at 12:01 BST12:01 BSTFreya Scott-TurnerLive reporter
Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kirk (third from the right), enjoyed a very close relationship with the Trump family, in particular Donald Trump Jr (third from the left)For people outside the US, Kirk's significance to the Trump movement may be hard to grasp, as many countries - the UK included - don't have a comparable figure."Other than my father, [Kirk] was the single-handed most important player of the last election," the president's son Donald Trump Jr told the Megyn Kelly Show last night.Despite not holding elected office, Kirk became a big part of the Trump machine through being able to reach young people on social media.Trump Jr says Kirk, who died aged 31, "moved the youth vote... especially the male vote"."When you're that age, it's a little more effective than sending an 85-year-old establishment politician... who doesn't understand social media... doesn't feel the vibe of what's going on. Charlie did those things."Analysis by Navigator Research conducted around the time of the election suggested 52% of Trump supporters got their news from social media.Trump made a string of appearances on podcasts hosted by influencers like Logan Paul, Adina Ross and Joe Rogan, and turned to social media activists to reach voters they might otherwise struggled to make an impression with.In the end, Trump increased his shared of the youth vote from 36% in 2020 to 46% in 2024, according to Circle, a centre that researches youth civic engagement.That helped Trump to a decisive win - and, as the president's son makes clear, his camp viewed Kirk as a major factor in that.

The manhunt for the gunman who killed Charlie Kirk continues. This is what we know.
The suspect arrived on campus at 11:52 local time on Wednesday
He reached his position by climbing the stairwells to the roof, before opening fire at around 12:20
CCTV footage shows a figure dressed in black running across a roof before dropping down to the ground and fleeing
The FBI recovered a weapon - an imported Mauser .30-06 bolt action rifle - in a wooded area near the scene wrapped in a towel
They are also analysing a palm print and a "footwear impression"
But there is still a great deal we don't know, including:
Where the search is being carried out - Utah law enforcement agency has "no idea" if suspect still in state
The name of the suspected gunman or any other identifying details
Whether police know some of that information and have chosen not to make it public at this stage

US military leaders have warned troops and staff over posts mocking the shooting of Charlie Kirk. Writing on X, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell says it is "unacceptable for military personnel and Department of War civilians to celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American. The Department of War has zero tolerance for it."Responding, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says: "We are tracking all these very closely â and will address, immediately. Completely unacceptable."It is unclear which posts Parnell and Hegseth are referring to.As a reminder, Donald Trump recently ordered the Department of Defense be rebranded as the Department of War.

Image source, FBIInvestigators are describing the person pictured in the CCTV stills above as a "person of interest" while they try to gather more information which could lead to the individual being labelled a suspect, a former FBI special agent has told the BBC News Channel.Kenneth Gray says law enforcement will be doing a "deep dive" into the leads that could identify the person pictured in photos the FBI released, in what Gray described as a "rapidly evolving investigation".But the description "suspect" has been used by Utah officials when describing the video of a person seen jumping down from a roof at Utah Valley University.Gray says having an identification "is only half of the equation, the other half is locating that person".
