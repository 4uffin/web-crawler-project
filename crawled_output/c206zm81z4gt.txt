You can see the locations of these communities below.After launching aircraft, receiving hundreds of leads, and releasing footage of the suspect, investigators took Robinson into custody at 22:00 last night. In an earlier post, we broke down the lead up to Robinson's arrest - one dubbed a "historic process" by the FBI's director. Before Robinson was arrested, officials deduced that the shooter had fired his gun from a roof on campus, before climbing off and running away.

US President Donald Trump has just posted a tribute to Charlie Kirk on his social media platform, Truth Social, after FBI and Utah officials held a news conference on the investigation into the shooting. "Everybody loved Charlie!", Trump writes alongside a picture of the pair embracing, with US and Israeli flags behind them. The picture contains the words: 'Great Charlie Kirk. R.I.P Shlomo perl."Vice President JD Vance has also shared a post on social media thanking authorities for finding the suspect."In some ways, the investigation is still in the early days. But I do believe we have the shooter in custody," he says. "We took a big step this morning in getting justice for Charlie, and for his family. Thanks be to God for that," he writes.
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBullet casing inscriptions give possible clue to motivepublished at 16:02 BST16:02 BSTMike WendlingBBC News
The markings on the bullets described by authorities
indicate that the suspect, Tyler Robinson, was steeped in online culture and
included references to the Antifa, or the anti-fascist, movement. A fired shell casing was inscribed with ânotices bulges OwO
whatâs this?â - a reference to a âcopypastaâ - a piece of text that is repeated
over and over again, often to troll people online.Authorities say one unfired casing had the words âHey fascist! Catch!â and an up, right and three down arrows. The three down arrows alone could be a common symbol used to represent the anti-fascist movement. As a whole, the sequence of arrows could reference a gaming cheat code - although this remains unclear, and authorities have not yet released images of the casings.A second casing had the lyrics to a song âBella Ciaoâ
inscribed on it. The song honours WWII-era partisans of the Italian resistance
who fought Nazi Germany.The third unfired casing was inscribed with the words âIf
you read this, you are gay lmaoâ - again an apparent
reference to online trolling humour. Antifa is a loose collection of far-left activists who have been active in the US over the last decade, at street protests and other events. They often oppose Trump's policies and far-right groups.

"It is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the American experiment, it is an attack on our ideals," he says, adding it "cuts to the very foundation of who we are".Cox says Kirk being killed while championing freedom of expression makes it "more difficult for people to feel like they can share their ideas" and speak freely. "We will never be able to solve all the other problems - including the violence problems that people are worried about -
if we can't have a clash of ideas safely and securely. Even - especially, especially, those ideas with which you disagree," he adds.
