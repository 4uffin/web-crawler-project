when I add the topLevelAwait in the vite config like this:
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import path from "node:path";
import svgr from "vite-plugin-svgr";
import topLevelAwait from "vite-plugin-top-level-await";
import commonjs from "@rollup/plugin-commonjs";
export default defineConfig({
define: {
"process.env": JSON.stringify({
NODE_ENV: "production",
}),
},
plugins: [
commonjs(),
react(),
svgr({
svgrOptions: {
// svgr options
},
include: "**/*.svg?react",
}),
topLevelAwait(),
],
css: {},
optimizeDeps:{
exclude: []
},
build: {
commonjsOptions: { include: [] },
outDir: "build",
sourcemap: true,
rollupOptions: {
},
},
resolve: {
alias: {
"@": path.resolve(__dirname, "src"),
"~bootstrap": path.resolve(__dirname, "node_modules/bootstrap")
},
},
});
the vite build output did not generate sourcemapurl at the end of the output js file. when I remove the topLevelAwait plugin. the url generated like this:
//# sourceMappingURL=index-Cqqbffuz.js.map
why the source map did not generated the url at end of js file when use topLevelAwait? this is the index.tsx:
import * as React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);
root.render(
<React.StrictMode>
<div/>
</React.StrictMode>
);
reportWebVitals();
this is the package.json:

}
and this is the vite.config.mts:
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import path from "node:path";
import svgr from "vite-plugin-svgr";
import topLevelAwait from "vite-plugin-top-level-await";
import commonjs from "@rollup/plugin-commonjs";
export default defineConfig({
define: {
"process.env": JSON.stringify({
NODE_ENV: "production",
}),
},
plugins: [
commonjs(),
react()
],
css: {},
optimizeDeps:{
exclude: []
},
build: {
commonjsOptions: { include: [] },
outDir: "build",
sourcemap: true,
rollupOptions: {
},
},
resolve: {
alias: {
"@": path.resolve(__dirname, "src"),
"~bootstrap": path.resolve(__dirname, "node_modules/bootstrap")
},
},
});
does the topLevelAwait
conflict with source map? I did not found anyone facing this issue.
