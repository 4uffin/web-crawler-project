Just a caution regarding a key assumption in this article - the assumption is that metacognition/reflection is “good”.However, some people experience too much metacognition/reflection and that is actually correlated with depression/anxiety. These people also tend to be highly intelligent, and I suspect a higher proportion of HN readers will fall into this category.Turns out just running on autopilot most of the time is the healthier human experience.replycard_zero 8 minutes ago

I won't take some time to reflect on that.replyVoid_ 24 minutes ago

I have mixed thoughts about audio journaling.At first I was in love - I made an app around Whisper transcription model the weekend it came out. (Still working on it - https://whispermemos.com)But when I try to read those recordings, they seem long and uninteresting.I think the slowness of writing forces us to transform the thoughts/ideas into a format that has more substance.So typing creates better distilled version of the text, and writing with one even more.Recording audio just makes a raw stream of consciousness.The process isn’t as therapeutic. It’s like stuffing food in your face instead of slowly chewing.What are your thoughts on this?replyLoganDark 10 minutes ago

I have wanted to record parts of my stream of consciousness so I can put more time into it later - but that will require me to block out time to do that. I hope I'll have it some day.replyvijucat 1 hour ago

Somewhat related: sentence completions / fill-in-the-blank templates are shockingly effective at eliciting your inner thoughts which even you didn't know you were feeling. The idea is from Nathaniel Branden's work."What I regret right now is ____""What I should now is ____""I am become aware that ____"You don't need to journal these on paper. Don't do these in public. You might find yourself overwhelmed by what comes out.replytibbar 1 hour ago

Left unsaid is why this practice can be so meaningful. I think it's just that: these are the questions you wish someone else would ask you. When we're stressed, angry, grieving, lost, I think we all yearn to have someone care about us enough to ask these questions, to let us open up, to not be alone.And while I think it's great when that can actually be another person, whether it's a friend, or partner, or therapist, it is still surprisingly calming, healing, even, when we pose the question to ourselves, and then really wait to hear the answer.replyBrajeshwar 2 hours ago

This is an interesting perspective and I like this. I'm going to see how this method goes. I journal and tend to write a lot. This is after years of repeated tries, failures, and re-tries.I agree with the simple physical pen/paper combo.[1] For the digital part, I suggest sticking to plain-text.[2] Personally, I’ve a feeling video or audio, unless transcribed and texted, will likely become cumbersome and will remain in oblivion.1. https://brajeshwar.com/2025/notes/2. “Every device, including ones long gone, and ones not invented yet, can read and edit plain text.” - Derek Siversreplydoganugurlu 25 minutes ago

Slightly off topic: I have little tolerance for “not just X but also Y” phrasing because of ChatGPT.I counted 3 almost back to back and stopped reading.I don’t think people realize how much ChatGPT “leaks” its own commentary into their writing.replypetesergeant 2 hours ago

I’ve been journaling for 15 years. Top tip: remove any need at all to do it “right”. Have a time in the day to do it, and be comfortable with writing just one word, or two sentences, or an essay, just whatever comes out. The best kind of journaling is the one you actually do, and even five-word entries written ten years ago will transport me back to what I was feeling and thinking. Every failed attempt I’ve seen or heard of has people feeling they have to write an essay.reply
