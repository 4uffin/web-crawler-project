Just a caution regarding a key assumption in this article - the assumption is that metacognition/reflection is “good”.However, some people experience too much metacognition/reflection and that is actually correlated with depression/anxiety. These people also tend to be highly intelligent, and I suspect a higher proportion of HN readers will fall into this category.Turns out just running on autopilot most of the time is the healthier human experience.replyvijucat 31 minutes ago

Somewhat related: sentence completions / fill-in-the-blank templates are shockingly effective at eliciting your inner thoughts which even you didn't know you were feeling. The idea is from Nathaniel Branden's work."What I regret right now is ____""What I should now is ____""I am become aware that ____"You don't need to journal these on paper. Don't do these in public. You might find yourself overwhelmed by what comes out.replytibbar 59 minutes ago

Left unsaid is why this practice can be so meaningful. I think it's just that: these are the questions you wish someone else would ask you. When we're stressed, angry, grieving, lost, I think we all yearn to have someone care about us enough to ask these questions, to let us open up, to not be alone.And while I think it's great when that can actually be another person, whether it's a friend, or partner, or therapist, it is still surprisingly calming, healing, even, when we pose the question to ourselves, and then really wait to hear the answer.replyBrajeshwar 1 hour ago

This is an interesting perspective and I like this. I'm going to see how this method goes. I journal and tend to write a lot. This is after years of repeated tries, failures, and re-tries.I agree with the simple physical pen/paper combo.[1] For the digital part, I suggest sticking to plain-text.[2] Personally, I’ve a feeling video or audio, unless transcribed and texted, will likely become cumbersome and will remain in oblivion.1. https://brajeshwar.com/2025/notes/2. “Every device, including ones long gone, and ones not invented yet, can read and edit plain text.” - Derek Siversreplypetesergeant 1 hour ago

I’ve been journaling for 15 years. Top tip: remove any need at all to do it “right”. Have a time in the day to do it, and be comfortable with writing just one word, or two sentences, or an essay, just whatever comes out. The best kind of journaling is the one you actually do, and even five-word entries written ten years ago will transport me back to what I was feeling and thinking. Every failed attempt I’ve seen or heard of has people feeling they have to write an essay.reply
